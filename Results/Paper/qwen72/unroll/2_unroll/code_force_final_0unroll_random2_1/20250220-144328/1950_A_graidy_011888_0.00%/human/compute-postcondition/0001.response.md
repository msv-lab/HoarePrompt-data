The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the implicit condition that `i` is compared against, which is 1000. For the loop to execute, the condition `i <= 1000` must be true. Given that `i` is 1, which is less than 1000, the condition is already satisfied, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1**
