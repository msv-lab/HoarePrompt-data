The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the size of the list `c` and the number of queries, respectively.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the list.
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, representing the range of indices for the query.

The function returns the results of the queries for each test case. Each query result is based on the range `[l_i, r_i]` provided in the query.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the list `c`, `q` is the number of queries, and `c` is a list of integers. For each test case, it processes `q` queries, each defined by a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list `c`, and returns the results of these queries.**
