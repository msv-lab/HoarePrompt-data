Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint accordingly.

2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`a == 1`), the function updates `bx` to be the maximum value of `x` encountered. This ensures that `k` must be greater than or equal to `bx`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`a == 2`), the function updates `ax` to be the minimum value of `x` encountered. This ensures that `k` must be less than or equal to `ax`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`a == 3`), the function adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` must not be equal to any value in `cx`.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - The function checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this condition is true, it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, the function calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range) to get the final count of valid integers.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the expected output format.

The function correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem description and the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
