You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n constraints is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be excluded (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the minimum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the maximum lower bound (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Valid Range**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Excluded Values**:
   - If there is a valid range (`bx < ax`), the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly identifies the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`).
  - This ensures that the range `[bx, ax]` is the valid range for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly excludes the values that must not be equal to `k` by adding them to the set `cx`.
  - It then counts how many of these excluded values fall within the valid range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, the function correctly returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
  - The function correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 that fall within the valid range.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that the exclusion values are unique and that the operations (addition and membership check) are efficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
