Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it works in every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraint Collection**: For each test case, it collects the constraints and updates the minimum upper bound (`ax`) and the maximum lower bound (`bx`).
3. **Range Validation**: It checks if the maximum lower bound `bx` is greater than or equal to the minimum upper bound `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
4. **Exclusion of Specific Values**: It uses a set `cx` to keep track of values that `k` must not be equal to. For each value in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]`, it increments a counter `tmp`.
5. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of excluded values `tmp` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`, which is `ax - bx + 1`.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description:
- It correctly handles the case where the range is invalid (i.e., `bx >= ax`).
- It correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k` must not be equal to specific values).
- It correctly handles the case where the range is valid and there are no excluded values.
- It correctly handles the case where the range is valid and there are excluded values.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs.
