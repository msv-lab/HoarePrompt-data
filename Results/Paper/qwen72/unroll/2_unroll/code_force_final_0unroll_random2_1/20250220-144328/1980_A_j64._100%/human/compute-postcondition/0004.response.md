The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the range defined by `7`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute 7 times regardless of the values in `count`, `n`, `m`, or `needed_problems`, because the range is fixed at 7. However, for the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`count` is a list of 7 integers, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `needed_problems` is 0, `i` is 0**
