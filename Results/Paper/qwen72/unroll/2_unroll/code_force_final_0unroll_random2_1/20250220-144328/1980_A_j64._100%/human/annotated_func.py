    #The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same list of 7 integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns the total number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function does not modify the input string `a`.
