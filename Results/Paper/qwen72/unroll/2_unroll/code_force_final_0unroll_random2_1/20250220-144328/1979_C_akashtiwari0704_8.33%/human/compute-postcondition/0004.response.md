Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `bets` representing the number of bets, and a list `a` of `bets` integers representing the outcomes. It calculates the product of all elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the product divided by the original value. It sums these modified values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list `a` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
