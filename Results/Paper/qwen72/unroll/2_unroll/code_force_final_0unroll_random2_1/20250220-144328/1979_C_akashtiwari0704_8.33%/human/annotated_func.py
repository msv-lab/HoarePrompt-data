#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. For example: `def distribute_coins(t, n, k):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and `k` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` representing the number of bets, and a list `a` of `bets` integers representing the outcomes. It calculates the product of all elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the product divided by the original value. It sums these modified values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list `a` as a space-separated string. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `bets`, and `a` will have been used and modified as described, but their final values will depend on the input provided. The variable `prod` and `sumo` will be reset for each test case, and `ans` will be a string containing the space-separated modified list for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `bets` representing the number of bets, and a list `a` of `bets` integers representing the outcomes. It calculates the product of all elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the product divided by the original value. It sums these modified values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list `a` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
