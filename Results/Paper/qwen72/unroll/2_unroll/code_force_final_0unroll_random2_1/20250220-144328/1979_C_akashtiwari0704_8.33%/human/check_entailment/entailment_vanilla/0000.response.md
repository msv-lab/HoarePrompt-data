### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `k_i` is the multiplier and `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and sums these bets to `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The product of all multipliers `prod` is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
   - Setting `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` ensures that the amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
   - The sum of all bets `sumo` is `sum(prod // k_i)` for all `i`.
   - For the distribution to be valid, `sumo` must be strictly less than `prod`.

4. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it means the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, which violates the problem's requirement.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the distribution is valid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` are the same, `sumo` will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, which is `n * (k_i^(n-1))`. This will be greater than or equal to `prod` if `n >= k_i`, which is why the program correctly prints `-1` in such cases.
   - For other cases, the program ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than `prod`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and prints the bets or `-1` accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
