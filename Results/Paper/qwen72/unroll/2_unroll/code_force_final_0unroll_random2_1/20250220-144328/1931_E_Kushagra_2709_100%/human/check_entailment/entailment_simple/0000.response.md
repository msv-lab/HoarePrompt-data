### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program handles multiple test cases as required.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initial Calculation of `tot`:**
     - `tot` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`. This is correct because it represents the total number of digits in the list before any moves are made.
   - **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
     - The function `zerocnts` is used to calculate the number of trailing zeros for each number in `nums`. This is important because trailing zeros can be removed when the number is reversed, which affects the total number of digits.
   - **Optimal Play Strategy:**
     - The program sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order and subtracts the values at even indices from `tot`. This is based on the idea that Anna can reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros, which will reduce the total number of digits the most.
     - The subtraction is done in a way that maximizes the reduction in `tot` for Anna's moves, which is a good heuristic for optimal play.
   - **Winning Condition:**
     - The program checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1` after all possible moves. If `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
     - This condition is correct because if the total number of digits is at least `m + 1`, Sasha can always form a number that is at least `10^m`.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - **Trailing Zeros Count:**
     - The function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the number.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The function returns the count of trailing zeros, which is used in the main function to determine the optimal moves.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the problem description. The strategy of maximizing the reduction in the total number of digits for Anna's moves and then checking the final condition for Sasha's win is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
