The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It operates on an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, which are obtained internally through calls to `func_3` and `func_1`. The function modifies the list `a` and returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a specific bit pattern, encountered during the iterations where the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of the elements in `a` is even. The function does not change the values of `n` and `x`, but `a` is modified during the process.
