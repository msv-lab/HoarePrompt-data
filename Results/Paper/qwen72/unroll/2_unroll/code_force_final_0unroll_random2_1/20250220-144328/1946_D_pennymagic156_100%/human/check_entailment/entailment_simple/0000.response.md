### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` using `func_3()`, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` using `func_1()`.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The program iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0 (since the problem specifies that \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`, it calculates `u` (the i-th bit of `x`) and `v` (the sum of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`).

3. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - If `u == v == 0`, it continues to the next bit position. This is correct because if both `u` and `v` are 0, the current bit does not affect the result.
   - If `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 1`, it returns `ans` immediately. This is correct because if the i-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is odd, it is impossible to satisfy the condition \((a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x\).
   - If `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 0`, it tries to partition the array `a` into segments where the XOR of the i-th bits of the elements in each segment is 0. This is done by maintaining a running XOR `op` and a running sum `ai`. When `op` becomes 0, it appends `ai` to `t` and resets `ai` to 0. This is a correct approach to partition the array.
   - If `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`, it counts the number of segments where the XOR of the i-th bits of the elements is 0. This is done by maintaining a running XOR `op` and a counter `cnt`. When `op` becomes 0, it increments `cnt`. This is also a correct approach to count the segments.
   - If `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 1`, it continues to the next bit position. This is correct because if the i-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the i-th bits of `a` is odd, it is still possible to satisfy the condition.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all bit positions, the program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. This is correct because `ans` stores the maximum number of segments found where the condition is satisfied, and the length of `a` is the number of elements in the modified list, which is also a valid candidate for the answer.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the input, processes the bitwise operations, and returns the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given condition. The logic and conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements.
