Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the count of the current median in the array and prints it, which does not correspond to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
3
2 2 8
```
The current median is 2. The program will output `2` because there are two occurrences of `2` in the array. However, the correct output should be `1` because you can increase the first element by 1 to get `[3, 2, 8]`, which has a median of 3, thus increasing the median in just one operation.

The program fails to handle the logic for finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It should instead find the smallest number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value.
