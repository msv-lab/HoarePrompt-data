Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the sorted array and prints this count. However, this does not correctly solve the problem for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Operations**: The number of operations required to increase the median is not necessarily the count of the current median. Instead, it should be the minimum number of increments needed to make the current median greater than the next smallest element in the array.

2. **Handling Even and Odd Lengths**: The program does not correctly handle arrays of even length. For an array of even length, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\) in the sorted array. However, to increase the median, you need to consider both the middle elements.

3. **Finding the Next Element to Increment**: The program does not find the next element that needs to be incremented to increase the median. It should identify the smallest element that is greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to or greater than this next element.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
