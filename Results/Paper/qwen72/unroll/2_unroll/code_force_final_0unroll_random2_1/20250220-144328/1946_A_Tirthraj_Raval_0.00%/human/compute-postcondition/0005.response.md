Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list, finds the count of the middle element (or the element just before the middle if `n` is even), and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. The input parameters `t` and the list of tuples are not modified. **
