Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not properly initialize the `defaultdict` with a default value function. The line `d = defaultdict(default_value)` should be `d = defaultdict(int)`. This is because `default_value` is not defined, and the program will raise a `NameError` when it tries to initialize the `defaultdict`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of problems required for a difficulty level is exactly `m`. The logic in the loop `for val in d.keys():` should check if the number of problems for a difficulty level is less than `m`, not less than or equal to `m`. This is because if the number of problems is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
