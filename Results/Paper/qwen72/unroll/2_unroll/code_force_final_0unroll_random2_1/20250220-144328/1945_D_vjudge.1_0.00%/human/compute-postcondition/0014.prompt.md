You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n, where each element a_i and b_i satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` before the last `k` elements, plus the sum of `soma_b` values accumulated during these iterations.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, plus the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B`. `pref` remains unchanged. `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` in the range `n - k` to `n - 1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` in the range `n - k` to `n - 1`, and `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, plus the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
