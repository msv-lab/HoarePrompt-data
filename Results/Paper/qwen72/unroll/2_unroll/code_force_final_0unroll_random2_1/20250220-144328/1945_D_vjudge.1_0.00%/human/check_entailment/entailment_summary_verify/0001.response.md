### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Reversal:**
   - The program reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m` (referred to as `k` in the function `func_1`).
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` and reverses them. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to process the people in the queue from the end to the beginning, which is necessary for Kirill to determine the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative cost of moving past people in the queue.
   - It also initializes `pref` to 0, which will store the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people.
   - The program iterates over the first `n - k` people in the reversed queue (which corresponds to the last `n - k` people in the original queue). For each person:
     - If the cost to move to the person (`a[i]`) is less than the cost to move past the person (`b[i]`), Kirill will move to this position and pay `a[i]` plus the cumulative cost `soma_b`. The cumulative cost `soma_b` is reset to 0.
     - Otherwise, the cumulative cost `soma_b` is increased by `b[i]`.

3. **Final Position Calculation:**
   - After processing the first `n - k` people, the program calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the remaining positions (from `n - k` to `n`).
   - It does this by iterating over the remaining positions and updating the `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
   - The `resultado` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) to ensure that the first valid cost is always taken.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost `resultado` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling and Reversal:**
  - The input handling is correct, and reversing the lists is a valid approach to simplify the problem of moving Kirill to the front of the queue.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people is sound. It correctly considers the cost to move to a specific position and the cumulative cost to move past other positions.
  - The program ensures that Kirill can move to any position within the first `m` people and finds the minimum cost to do so.
- **Final Position Calculation:**
  - The program correctly iterates over the remaining positions and updates the `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
- **Output:**
  - The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
