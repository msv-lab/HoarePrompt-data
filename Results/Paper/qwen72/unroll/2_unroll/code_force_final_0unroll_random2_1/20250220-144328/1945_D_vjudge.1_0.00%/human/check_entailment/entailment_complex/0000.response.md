### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
     - Both lists are reversed, which is a key step in the algorithm.
   - **Initialization:**
     - `soma_b` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of `b_i` values for positions where Kirill can potentially bribe.
     - `pref` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the minimum cost for positions where Kirill can bribe.
   - **First Loop:**
     - The loop iterates from 0 to `n - k - 1` (i.e., the first `n - k` positions).
     - For each position `i`, if `a_i` is less than `b_i`, Kirill can bribe the person at position `i` to move to position `j` (where `j < i`). The cost of this bribe is added to `pref`, and `soma_b` is reset to 0.
     - If `a_i` is greater than or equal to `b_i`, the cost `b_i` is added to `soma_b`.
   - **Second Loop:**
     - The loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1` (i.e., the last `k` positions).
     - For each position `i`, the function calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to position `i` by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `a_i` to a running minimum (`resultado`).
     - `soma_b` is updated to include the current `b_i` value.
   - **Output:**
     - The function prints the minimum cost (`resultado`) required for Kirill to be among the first `m` people.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`).
   - **Loop:**
     - The loop runs `numero_testes` times, and in each iteration, it calls `func_1`.
   - **Output:**
     - The function does not return any value, but it ensures that `func_1` is called for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Reversing the Lists:**
  - The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This is done to simplify the logic of the algorithm, as it allows us to process the elements from the end of the queue to the front.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The first loop calculates the cost of moving Kirill to positions before the last `k` positions.
  - The second loop calculates the minimum cost of moving Kirill to the last `k` positions.
- **Correctness:**
  - The algorithm correctly handles the problem by ensuring that Kirill can move to the first `m` positions with the minimum cost.
  - The use of `soma_b` and `pref` ensures that the costs are accumulated correctly.
  - The final result is the minimum cost among all possible positions in the last `k` elements, which is what the problem requires.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the input and output as specified.

### Correctness:
