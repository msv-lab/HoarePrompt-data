Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0.** 

The variable `pref` has been initialized to 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
