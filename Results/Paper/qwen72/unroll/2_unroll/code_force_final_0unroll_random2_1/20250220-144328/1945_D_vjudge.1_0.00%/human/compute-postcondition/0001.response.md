The only object in the loop head is the variable `numero_testes`, and the loop counter `_`. For the loop to execute, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, we do not need to adjust it. However, the loop counter `_` will start from 0 and iterate up to `numero_testes - 1`.

State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
