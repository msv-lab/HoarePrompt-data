The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and all strings in the test cases are distinct. This means `t` is already within the required range, but we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `i` is 0, and all strings in the test cases are distinct.**
