Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the condition is met. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.***
