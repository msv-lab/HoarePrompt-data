Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `n` and `t` are now integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, and the input is provided externally.
- The code snippet `n, t = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively.
- The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, as specified in the initial state.
- The value of `t` is now an integer, but its specific range is not provided in the initial state.
- The value of `u_1` remains as specified in the initial state (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n).
- The tree is still guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, as this condition is not affected by the code snippet.
