#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers that represent a sequence where each pair `(u, v)` from the input is added to the deque based on the conditions in the loop, and `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the condition is met. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user to construct a tree represented as a deque. It then determines the minimum number of moves required to reach the starting node from either end of the deque. If at least one of these minimum moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers representing the tree structure, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, `start` is the input integer representing the starting node, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, and `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
