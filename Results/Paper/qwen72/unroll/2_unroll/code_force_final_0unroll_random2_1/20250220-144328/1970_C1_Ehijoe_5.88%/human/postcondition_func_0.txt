The function `func_1` reads input from the user to construct a tree represented as a deque. It then determines the minimum number of moves required to reach the starting node from either end of the deque. If at least one of these minimum moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers representing the tree structure, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, `start` is the input integer representing the starting node, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, and `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
