Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there is a digit that comes after a letter. For example, the password "a1b2" should return "NO" because the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', but the program will return "YES" because it does not check this condition properly. The function `func_1` should ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the password, but it does not implement this check.
