The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `digits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `digits` list. If the `digits` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in ascending order, and `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in ascending order. For the loop to be executed, `digits` must have at least one element, and `i` must start at 0.

State: **`digits` is a sorted list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
