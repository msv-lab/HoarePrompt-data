Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a password is strong based on the provided conditions. Here are the issues:

1. **Digit and Letter Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `digits` and `letters` lists separately, but it does not check if the original password itself is sorted. It only checks if the concatenated sorted lists match the original password, which is incorrect.

2. **Digit After Letter**:
   - The condition to check if there is a digit that comes after a letter is not correctly implemented. The program checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the correct logic. It should check if any digit appears after a letter in the original password.

3. **Non-decreasing Order**:
   - The program checks if the digits and letters are sorted in the non-decreasing order, but it does not correctly handle the case where the password contains both digits and letters.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    last_char_type = None  # None: not started, 'd': digit, 'l': letter
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if last_char_type == 'l':
                return False  # Digit after letter
            digits.append(char)
            last_char_type = 'd'
        else:
            letters.append(char)
            last_char_type = 'l'
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Digit After Letter Check**:
   - The `last_char_type` variable keeps track of the type of the last character (digit or letter). If a digit appears after a letter, the function returns `False`.

2. **Non-decreasing Order Check**:
   - The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted` function.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`.

This corrected program will correctly determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.
