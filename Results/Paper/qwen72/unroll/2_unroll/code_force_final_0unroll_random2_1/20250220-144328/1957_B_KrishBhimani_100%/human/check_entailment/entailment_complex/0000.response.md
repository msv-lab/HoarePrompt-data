### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case (n == 1)**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function simply prints `k`. This is correct because the sequence must contain exactly one integer, and that integer must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.

3. **General Case (n > 1)**:
   - The function initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - It appends this largest power of 2 (denoted as `(1 << i) - 1`) to the result list `ans`.
   - It then appends the remaining value `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans` to ensure the sequence has exactly `n` integers.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sequence `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the General Case:

- **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
  - The loop `while True` finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k` by doubling `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
  - The value `(1 << i) - 1` is the largest number with `i` bits set to 1. For example, if `i = 3`, then `(1 << 3) - 1 = 7` (binary `111`).

- **Appending the Remaining Value**:
  - The function appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
  - This is correct because the sum of the sequence will be the sum of the largest power of 2 and the remaining value, which together equal `k`.

- **Appending Zeros**:
  - The function appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans` to ensure the sequence has exactly `n` integers.
  - This is correct because the sequence must have `n` integers, and the remaining integers are set to 0 to meet this requirement.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1 (n = 1, k = 5)**:
  - The function prints `5`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2 (n = 2, k = 3)**:
  - The function finds the largest power of 2 less than 3, which is 2.
  - It appends 1 (since `2 - 1 = 1`) and then appends 2 - 1 = 1.
  - The sequence is `1 2`, which sums to 3 and has two 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR (11 in binary).

- **Test Case 3 (n = 2, k = 5)**:
  - The function finds the largest power of 2 less than 5, which is 4.
  - It appends 3 (since `4 - 1 = 3`) and then appends 5 - 3 = 2.
  - The sequence is `3 2`, which sums to 5 and has three 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR (11 in binary).

- **Test Case 4 (n = 6, k = 51)**:
  - The function finds the largest power of 2 less than 51, which is 32.
  - It appends 31 (since `32 - 1 = 31`) and then appends 51 - 31 = 20.
  - The sequence is `31 20 0 0 0 0`, which sums to 51 and has five 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR (11111 in binary).

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the base case and the general case, ensuring that the sequence of integers meets the conditions of the problem. The sequence is constructed such that the sum of the integers equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**
