You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:

            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints a sequence of integers. If n == 1, it prints the value of k. Otherwise, it prints a sequence of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is k minus the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0. The values of t, n, and k for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints the value of `k`. Otherwise, it prints a sequence of `n` integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the second integer is `k` minus the first integer, and the remaining `n-2` integers are 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\) with a single element is to have `a_1 = k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` and appends \((1 << i) - 1\) to `ans`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the `i`-th bit, where `i` is the highest bit position such that \(2^i < k\).
   - The program then appends the remaining value `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans` to ensure the sequence has exactly `n` elements.

4. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The value \((1 << i) - 1\) is used to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. This is because \((1 << i) - 1\) is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `i`-th bit.
   - The remaining value `k - sum(ans)` is added to ensure the sum condition is met. This value will be a non-negative integer.
   - The zeros appended at the end do not affect the bitwise OR result, as the OR of any number with 0 is the number itself.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case, ensuring that the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the single element case and the multiple elements case. It ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
