Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `w` times, and for each iteration, it reads `ln` integers from input, processes them to count the number of unique integers that appear at least 3 times, and prints this count. After `w` iterations, the loop finishes, and the values of `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` are not retained between iterations.**
