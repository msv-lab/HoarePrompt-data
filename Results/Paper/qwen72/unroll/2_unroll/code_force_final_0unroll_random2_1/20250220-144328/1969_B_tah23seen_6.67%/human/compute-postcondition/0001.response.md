The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sChar`. If `sChar` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `sChar` is a binary string with a length of 2 or more, the loop will definitely execute at least once. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be the first character of `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of 2 or more, `i` is the first character of `sChar`, `s` is an empty list**
