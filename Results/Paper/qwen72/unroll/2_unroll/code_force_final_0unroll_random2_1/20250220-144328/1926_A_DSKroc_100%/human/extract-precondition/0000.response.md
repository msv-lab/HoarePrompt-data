Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
