Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). It does not generalize to handle any value of \( n \) within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any other value of \( n \), the program prints 'No esta en el rango', which is not the correct output as per the problem description. The problem requires the program to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \), and the current implementation fails to do so for \( n > 4 \).

Final: **False**
