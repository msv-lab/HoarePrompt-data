Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `casos` from the input, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern to the console. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the checkerboard patterns or the out-of-range message for each test case have been printed to the console. The variable `casos` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer read during the last iteration of the loop. **
