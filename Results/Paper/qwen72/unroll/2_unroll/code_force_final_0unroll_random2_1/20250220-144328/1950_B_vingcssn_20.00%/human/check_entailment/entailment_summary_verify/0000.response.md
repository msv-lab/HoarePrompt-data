Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func` only explicitly handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program will print 'No esta en el rango', which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires the program to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` within the range, not just for `n` equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The function summary confirms that the function `func` prints a checkerboard pattern for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, but for any other value, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. This behavior is inconsistent with the problem requirements, which demand a generalized solution for all valid `n` values.

Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect as it fails to meet the problem's requirements for `n` values outside the explicitly handled cases.

Final: **False**
