Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the logic used in the function is flawed.
   - The function attempts to use a fixed number of stalls (2) and a specific pricing strategy, but this does not always work for all cases. For example, it does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 60 or where the prices need to be adjusted to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is incorrect. The function should print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices, or "NO" if it's impossible. However, the function prints "2" before "YES" in some cases, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Handling of Multiple Stalls**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, in the third test case, the correct output should be 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but the function does not generate this output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the function might not generate the correct number of stalls or prices.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob should be able to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use a binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        # Use binary representation of k to determine the prices
        prices = []
        remaining_coins = n
        for i in range(60):
            if k & (1 << i):
                price = 1 << i
                if price > remaining_coins:
                    print('NO')
                    break
                prices.append(price)
                remaining_coins -= price
        else:
            print(len(prices))
            print(*prices)
```

This corrected program:
- Checks if `n` is less than `k` and prints "NO" if it is.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. Each bit set in `k` corresponds to a stall price that is a power of 2.
- Ensures that the total number of stalls does not exceed 60 and that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.
