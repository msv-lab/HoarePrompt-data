The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
2. It also states that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.
3. The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, it will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
