### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from the first stall and buying as many as possible until she runs out of coins or has bought `k` jewels.
   - The task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide the number of stalls and the prices.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is a straightforward case.
   - If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. This is also straightforward.

3. **Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall is set to `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall is set to 1 coin per jewel.
   - The idea is that Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall and then use the remaining coins to buy from the second stall.

4. **Calculating the Number of Jewels Bought:**
   - The program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - `curr = n // i` calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from the current stall.
   - `h += curr` accumulates the total number of jewels bought.
   - `n -= i * curr` updates the remaining coins after buying from the current stall.

5. **Checking the Total Number of Jewels:**
   - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES" and the prices of the two stalls.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if it is possible to set up the stalls and prices.
   - It prints "NO" if it is not possible.
   - If the answer is "YES", it prints the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Case 1: `n == k`**
  - The program correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall.

- **Case 2: `n < k`**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer coins.

- **Case 3: General Case**
  - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, which ensures Alice buys at most one jewel from this stall.
  - The second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of jewels bought `h` and checks if `h >= k`.
  - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO".
  - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for determining if it is possible to set up the stalls and prices is correct.
- The program correctly handles the output format by printing "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices only if the solution is valid.
- The program prints "NO" and does not print the number of stalls or prices if the solution is not valid.

### Final Correctness:
The program is correct in its logic and output format. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate in stating that the program has a logical error in the output format.

Final: **True**
