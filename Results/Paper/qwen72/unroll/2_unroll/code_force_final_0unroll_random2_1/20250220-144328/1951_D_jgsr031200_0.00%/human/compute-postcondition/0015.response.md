Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n = 0`
   - `h = (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1) + (n - k + 1) // 1`
   - `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`
   - `h < k`

2. **Calculate `h`:**
   - `n - k + 1` is a common term in the expression for `h`.
   - Let's denote `n - k + 1` as `term`.
   - `term = 0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`

   - Now, substitute `term` into the expression for `h`:
     - `h = (1 - k) // (1 - k) + (1 - k) // 1`
     - The first part `(1 - k) // (1 - k)`:
       - If `1 - k` is not zero, this will be 1.
       - If `1 - k` is zero, this will be 0 (since division by zero is not possible, but integer division of zero by zero is 0 in Python).
     - The second part `(1 - k) // 1`:
       - This will be `1 - k`.

   - Therefore, `h` can be simplified to:
     - `h = 1 + (1 - k)`

3. **Simplify `h`:**
   - `h = 1 + 1 - k = 2 - k`

4. **Check the condition `h < k`:**
   - `2 - k < k`
   - `2 < 2k`
   - `1 < k`

   - This means `k` must be greater than 1 for the condition `h < k` to be true.

5. **Evaluate the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - Since the condition `h < k` is given as true, the `print` statement will execute and print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
