Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- The function is handling multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, the current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

Given this information, when the `print(n)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `n`. Since `n` and `k` are equal at this point, the value of `n` is the same as the value of `k`.

Output: **n (where n is the value of n, which is equal to k)**
