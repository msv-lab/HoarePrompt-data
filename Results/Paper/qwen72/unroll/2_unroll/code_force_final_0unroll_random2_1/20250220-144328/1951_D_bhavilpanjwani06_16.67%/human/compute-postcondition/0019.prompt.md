You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is the value of n, which is equal to k)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer calculated as n - k + 1 and 1 is the explicit value)
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, with `n` not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then `k` is less than `n - k + 2`. Otherwise, `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.
        #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then either `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (implying `k` is less than `n - k + 2`), or `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. If `n` < `k`, no further changes are made to `n` and `k`. If `n` ≥ `k`, and `n` is equal to `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` > `k`, then either `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (implying `k` is less than `n - k + 2`), or `k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) where `n` is the number of coins Alice has and `k` is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. For each test case, if `n` is less than `k`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of `n` by `k`, indicating the number of jewels Alice can buy.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
