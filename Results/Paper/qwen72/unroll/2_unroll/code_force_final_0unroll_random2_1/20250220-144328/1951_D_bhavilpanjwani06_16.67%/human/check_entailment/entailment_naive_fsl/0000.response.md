Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid solution when `n` is much larger than `k` and there are multiple possible ways to set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
100 5
```
According to the problem description, Bob can set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 5 jewels. One valid solution could be:
```
YES
5
20 20 20 20 20
```
However, the program outputs:
```
YES
2
96 1
```
This output is incorrect because Alice will buy only 1 jewel from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 2 jewels, not 5.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is considered incorrect.
