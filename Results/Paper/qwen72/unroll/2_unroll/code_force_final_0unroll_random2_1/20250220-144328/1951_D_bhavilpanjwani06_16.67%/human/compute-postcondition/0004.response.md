Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. The function is handling multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, the current values of `n` and `k` are equal.**
