Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling the Case When `n > k`:**
   - The program checks if `n < k` and if `n == k`. However, when `n > k`, it only checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1` and prints a specific solution if this condition is met. This is not a general solution for all cases where `n > k`.

2. **General Solution for `n > k`:**
   - For `n > k`, Bob can always set up `k` stalls with each stall having a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will spend exactly `k` coins and be left with `n - k` coins, which is not enough to buy any more jewels from the remaining stalls.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program does not always print the correct number of stalls and their prices when `n > k`. It should print `k` stalls with each price set to 1 coin.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(['1'] * k))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Condition Check:**
  - If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO".
  - If `n >= k`, it is always possible for Bob to set up `k` stalls with each stall having a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- **Output:**
  - The program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls `k` and the prices of the stalls, which are all 1 coin.

This corrected program will handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
