#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: The lists `a` and `b` will be modified such that for the first position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ, if `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, the values at that position will be swapped. After the first swap or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position, the values will be swapped for all subsequent positions where `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. The flag `f` will be set to 1 if any swap occurs or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: a = [2, 3, 5, 7], b = [1, 4, 6, 8], f = 1, t = 10.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: a = [2, 3, 5, 7], b = [1, 4, 6, 8], f = 1, t = 10.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user input, modifies them according to specific rules, and prints the modified strings. The function ensures that for the first position where the digits in the two strings differ, if the digit in the first string is less than the digit in the second string, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in the first string is greater than the digit in the second string at any position, the digits will be swapped for all subsequent positions where the first string's digit is greater than the second string's digit. The function does not handle multiple test cases or return the sum of the integers represented by the strings.
