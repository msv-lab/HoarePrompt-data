You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user input, modifies them according to specific rules, and prints the modified strings. The function ensures that for the first position where the digits in the two strings differ, if the digit in the first string is less than the digit in the second string, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in the first string is greater than the digit in the second string at any position, the digits will be swapped for all subsequent positions where the first string's digit is greater than the second string's digit. The function does not handle multiple test cases or return the sum of the integers represented by the strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always maximize the product of \( x \) and \( y \). Specifically, the program only swaps digits once and then continues to swap if the condition \( a[i] > b[i] \) is met, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum product.

Counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  123
  321
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  323
  121
  ```
  (This maximizes the product: \( 323 \times 121 = 39183 \))

- Actual Output:
  ```
  321
  123
  ```
  (This does not maximize the product: \( 321 \times 123 = 39483 \))

In this case, the program does not correctly maximize the product of \( x \) and \( y \).
