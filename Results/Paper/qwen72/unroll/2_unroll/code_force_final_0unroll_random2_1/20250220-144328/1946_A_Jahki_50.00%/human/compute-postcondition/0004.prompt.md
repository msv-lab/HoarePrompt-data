You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for `num` iterations, and for each iteration, it will read `num2` and `case` from the input. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print `1` and `16668` and break out of the loop. Otherwise, it will parse the list `a` from `case`, sort it, and then increment the middle element until the median increases, printing the number of operations required. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `num` test cases, and the variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `median` will have their final values based on the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, and returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` by at least 1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
