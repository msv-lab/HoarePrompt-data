Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the length of the array correctly.
   - However, it reads the array elements as a single string and then splits it, which is inefficient and unnecessary. It should directly read the array elements as integers.

2. **Break Statement**:
   - The `break` statement is used when `num2 > 10000`, which is incorrect. The problem guarantees that the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`, and there is no need to break out of the loop based on the length of the array.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the median index for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - However, the logic for increasing the median is flawed. It repeatedly increments the element at the median index and sorts the array, which is inefficient and does not necessarily lead to the minimum number of operations.

4. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program should increment the median element or the elements around the median to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   - The current logic only increments the median element and re-sorts the array, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Identify the median element(s) in the sorted array.
2. Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the median element(s) equal to this smallest number greater than the current median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for _ in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = num2 // 2 - 1
            mb = num2 // 2
            median = b[mb]
            new_median = b[ma] + 1
            while b[ma] < new_median:
                b[ma] += 1
                new_median = b[ma]
            while b[mb] < new_median:
                b[mb] += 1
                new_median = b[mb]
            op = (new_median - b[ma]) + (new_median - b[mb])
        else:
            ma = num2 // 2
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = b[ma] + 1
            while b[ma] < new_median:
                b[ma] += 1
                new_median = b[ma]
            op = new_median - b[ma]
        
        print(op)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The array elements are read directly as integers.
- **Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified.
- **Minimum Operations Calculation**:
  - For even-length arrays, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The program increments both middle elements to the smallest number greater than the current median.
  - For odd-length arrays, the median is the middle element. The program increments this element to the smallest number greater than the current median.
- **Efficiency**: The program avoids unnecessary sorting after each increment, which makes it more efficient.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
