Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Input Size**: The program incorrectly handles large input sizes. Specifically, it has a hard-coded check for `num2 > 10000` and prints a fixed value of `1` and `16668` without performing the actual computation. This is not in line with the problem description, which requires the program to handle all valid input sizes.

2. **Median Calculation**: The program attempts to increase the median by incrementing the element at the median index and re-sorting the array. However, this approach is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with `num2 = 5`. The median is `1`, and the program will keep incrementing the median element until it is greater than `1`, which is not the minimum number of operations required. The correct approach would be to find the smallest element greater than the current median and increment the necessary elements to make the median equal to that element.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array has only one element, the program should output `1` because the median can be increased by incrementing that element. However, the program does not account for this case.

4. **Efficiency**: The program sorts the array in each iteration of the while loop, which is inefficient and unnecessary. The median can be updated more efficiently without re-sorting the entire array.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input: 
  ```
  1
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output: 
  ```
  1
  16668
  ```

The program incorrectly prints `16668` due to the hard-coded check for `num2 > 10000`, which is not a valid solution for the given problem.
