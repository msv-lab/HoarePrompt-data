The function reads a number of test cases `num` from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `num2` and a space-separated list of integers `case`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it parses the list `a` from `case`, sorts it, and increments the middle element until the median increases, printing the number of operations required. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the number of operations for each test case or the special values if `num2` exceeds 10000.
