Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The function should take `n` and `a` as parameters.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` from the input, which is correct.
   - For each test case, it reads `num2` (the length of the array) and `case` (the array itself as a string), which is also correct.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function has a special case where if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because:
     - The problem does not specify any special behavior for large `num2`.
     - The function should handle all valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and compute the correct number of operations.
     - Breaking out of the loop after encountering a large `num2` means that the function will not process all test cases, which is against the problem's requirements.

3. **Array Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The function correctly parses the array `a` from the input string `case` and sorts it into `b`.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function correctly calculates the index of the median element `ma` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - The median is correctly identified as `b[ma]`.

5. **Incrementing the Median**:
   - The function increments the median element `b[ma]` until it is greater than the original median.
   - However, the function re-sorts the array `b` after each increment, which is inefficient and unnecessary. The median can be increased by incrementing the appropriate elements directly without re-sorting the entire array.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median, which is correct.

Given the issues with the special case handling and the inefficiency in the median incrementing process, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
