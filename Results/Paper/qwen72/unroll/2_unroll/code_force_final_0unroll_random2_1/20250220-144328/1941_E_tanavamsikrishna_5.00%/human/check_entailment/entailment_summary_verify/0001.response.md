### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function is designed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - The function iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
   - The function adds 1 to the cost of each cell to account for the installation cost.
   - The final cost for the row is the cost of the last cell in the row.

   **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The first loop updates the cost for the first `d-1` cells, which is correct because these cells are within the initial segment where the distance constraint is not yet applicable.
   - The second loop updates the cost for the remaining cells in the row. It uses a sliding window to find the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d` and adds the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the minimum cost for the entire row.

   **Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths and stores it in `rows`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and appends these sums to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

   **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The input is read correctly using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists, which is correct.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each row to calculate the cost, and the results are stored in `costs`.
   - The function then uses a sliding window to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows, which is correct.
   - The minimum total cost is printed for each test case.

   **Correctness:**
   - The sliding window approach used in `func_2` to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is correct.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read and processed correctly.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case, printed on a new line, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints given in the problem, such as the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have a depth of 0, as required by the problem.

6. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost for each row is calculated correctly.
   - The sliding window approach in `func_2` ensures that the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the grid.

Final: **True**
