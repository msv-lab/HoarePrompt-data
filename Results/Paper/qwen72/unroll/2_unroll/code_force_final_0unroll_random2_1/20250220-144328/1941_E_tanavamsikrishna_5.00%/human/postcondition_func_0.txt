The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row). It modifies the list `row` by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and setting the rest of the elements (from index `d-1` to the end) to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1. The last element of the list remains 0. The function always returns 0, and the value of `d` remains unchanged.
