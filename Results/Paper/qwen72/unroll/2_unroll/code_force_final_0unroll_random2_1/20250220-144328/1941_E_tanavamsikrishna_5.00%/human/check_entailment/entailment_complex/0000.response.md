Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of installing supports for a single row of the river grid.
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1, which is correct because the cost of installing a support in these cells is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The second loop sets each element from index `d-1` to the end of the row to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1. This is intended to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and the cost is minimized.
   - However, the function always returns `row[-1]`, which is 0 (since the last element of the row is always 0). This is incorrect because the total cost of installing supports should be the sum of the modified row elements, not just the last element.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes it to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - It correctly reads the input and constructs the `rows` list.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   - It then computes the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list and prints the minimum of these sums.
   - The issue with `func_1` means that the `costs` list will always contain 0s, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not return the correct cost for a single row, and as a result, `func_2` will always print 0, which is not the correct minimum total cost of installing supports.

Correctness: **False**
