You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The following n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from the standard input, consisting of four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` followed by `n` lines of `m` integers each, representing the depths of river cells. It processes this input and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
