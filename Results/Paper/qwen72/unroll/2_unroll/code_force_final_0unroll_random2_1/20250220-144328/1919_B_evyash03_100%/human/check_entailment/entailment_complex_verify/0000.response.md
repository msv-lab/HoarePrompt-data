### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)` is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It then calculates the number of '-' characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters: `abs(sub - count)`.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the function's behavior.
   - The function indeed returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
   - The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`.
   - However, the provided program will output `6` because it calculates `|3 - 3| = 0` and then returns `abs(0 - 6) = 6`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. It only calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty calculation required by the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
