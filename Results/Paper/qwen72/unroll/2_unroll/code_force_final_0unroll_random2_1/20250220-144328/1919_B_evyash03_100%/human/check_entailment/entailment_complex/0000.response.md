Reasoning:

The problem requires us to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not actually perform the splitting of the array or calculate the penalty based on the splitting. Instead, it simply counts the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in the string `expression` and returns the absolute difference between these counts.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider how to split the array to minimize the penalty. The optimal strategy is to split the array at every change from "+" to "-" or vice versa, because this ensures that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, and thus the penalty for each subarray is minimized.

Let's break down the correct approach:
1. **Splitting Strategy**: Split the array at every change in sign (from "+" to "-" or from "-" to "+"). This ensures that each subarray has a sum of zero or a very small absolute value, which minimizes the penalty.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For each subarray, calculate the penalty as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. Sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

The provided function does not implement this strategy. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-", which is not the same as the minimum penalty.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
