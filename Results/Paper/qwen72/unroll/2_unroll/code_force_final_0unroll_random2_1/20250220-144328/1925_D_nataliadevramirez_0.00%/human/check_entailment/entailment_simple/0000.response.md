### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time they are chosen for an excursion.
   - The expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs, each multiplied by the expected number of times the pair is chosen.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in k excursions is given by \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of n.
   - Since \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), the expected number of times a pair is chosen is \( \frac{2k}{n(n-1)} \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - The function iterates over each friendship pair and calculates the contribution of each pair to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( f \cdot \frac{2k}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The current formula \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) calculates the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is not relevant to the expected value calculation.

   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
     - It correctly reads the inputs and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
     - The results are printed for each test case.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{2k}{n(n-1)}
     \]
   - This formula should be implemented in `func_1`.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The division by \( n(n-1) \) should be handled using modular inverses to avoid floating-point arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the expected value. The correct formula should be \( f \cdot \frac{2k}{n(n-1)} \) instead of \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

### Correctness:
