### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from `a` in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - This part of the program correctly simulates the removal of elements from the array `a` based on the commands.

4. **Calculating Products:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the elements.
   - The program iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying each element to `p` and appending the result to `ans`.
   - This part of the program correctly calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order.

5. **Returning Results:**
   - The program returns the list `ans` in its original order using `reversed(ans)`.
   - However, the problem requires the remainder of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step, not the product itself.
   - The program should take the remainder of `p` with `m` before appending it to `ans`.

6. **Correctness of the Output:**
   - The program does not take the remainder of the product with `m` before appending it to `ans`.
   - This means that the output will not be the correct remainders as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not take the remainder of the product with `m` at each step, which is a crucial part of the problem requirements. The correct implementation should include `p = p * v % m` to ensure that the product is always taken modulo `m` before appending it to `ans`.
