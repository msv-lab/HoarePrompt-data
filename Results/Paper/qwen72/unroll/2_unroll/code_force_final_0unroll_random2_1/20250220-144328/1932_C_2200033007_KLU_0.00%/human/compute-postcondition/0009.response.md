Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, where `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.** 

Explanation: The `reversed(ans)` function reverses the list `ans`, but since the return statement is returning the reversed list, the output state is the list `ans` in its original order. The list `ans` was initially defined as the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
