Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the variable `m` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, and the variable `p` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The sum `m + p` is printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use after the loop completes.**
