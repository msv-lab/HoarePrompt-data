Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting and Replacement**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" and "pie" separately and then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string.
   - This approach is flawed because removing "map" might create new "pie" substrings that were not present initially, and vice versa. The program does not account for this interaction.

2. **Minimum Deletions**:
   - The program simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the sum. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count one "map" and one "pie" and output 2. However, the correct answer is 2, but the program's logic does not ensure that the minimum deletions are made.

3. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**:
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For instance, in the string "mappppie", the program will count one "map" and one "pie" and output 2, but the correct answer is 2 (removing the 'm' and the 'p' from "pie").

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as a sliding window or dynamic programming, to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the result to the length of the string
        min_deletions = n
        
        # Use a sliding window to find the minimum deletions
        for i in range(n + 1):
            # Count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the current window
            map_count = s[:i].count('map') + s[i:].count('map')
            pie_count = s[:i].count('pie') + s[i:].count('pie')
            
            # Calculate the deletions needed to remove all "map" and "pie" substrings
            deletions = map_count * 3 + pie_count * 3 - (map_count + pie_count) * 2
            
            # Update the minimum deletions
            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)
        
        print(min_deletions)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version uses a sliding window to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It iterates through all possible positions to split the string and calculates the deletions needed for each split. The minimum deletions across all splits are then printed.
