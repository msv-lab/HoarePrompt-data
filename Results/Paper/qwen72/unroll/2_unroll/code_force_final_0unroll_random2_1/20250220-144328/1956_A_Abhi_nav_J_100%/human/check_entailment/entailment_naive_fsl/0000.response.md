Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is overly simplistic and does not simulate the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on the sequence `a`. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 1
3 5
5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program outputs `2`, which is correct for this specific case, but it does not handle the game logic as described. For example, if we consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
2 1
3 5
6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the game would proceed as follows:

1. Initial lineup: ABCDEF
2. First round: Kick out 3rd and 5th players (C and E), lineup becomes ABDF
3. Second round: Kick out 3rd player (D), lineup becomes ABF
4. Third round: No one is kicked out, so the game ends, and players A and B are declared winners.

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game and is therefore incorrect.
