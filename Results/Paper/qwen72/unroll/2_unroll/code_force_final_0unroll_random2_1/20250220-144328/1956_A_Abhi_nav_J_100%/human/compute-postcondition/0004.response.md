The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` integers where `1 ≤ k ≤ 100` and the integers are in strictly increasing order (`1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100`). `b` is a list of `q` integers where `1 ≤ q ≤ 100` and each integer is between `1` and `100` inclusive.

Case_1: If an attempt is made to perform the operation `a - 1`, which is not valid for a list, the function returns an error message indicating that the operation is not valid.

Case_2: The function returns the list `b`, which is a list of `q` integers where `1 ≤ q ≤ 100` and each integer is between `1` and `100` inclusive.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. If an invalid operation (like `a - 1`) is attempted, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
