Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is overly simplistic and does not account for the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`. The function `func_1` simply returns `a - 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and `b` otherwise, which does not reflect the logic of the game.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the rounds of the game, removing the specified players from the sequence until no more players can be removed, and then count the remaining players. Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        removed = False
        for ai in a:
            if ai <= len(players):
                players.pop(ai - 1)
                removed = True
        if not removed:
            break
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    results = [simulate_game(a, ni) for ni in n_values]
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This program correctly simulates the game for each test case and each initial number of players `n_i`. It keeps track of the players in a list and removes the specified players in each round until no more players can be removed. Finally, it counts the remaining players and prints the results.
