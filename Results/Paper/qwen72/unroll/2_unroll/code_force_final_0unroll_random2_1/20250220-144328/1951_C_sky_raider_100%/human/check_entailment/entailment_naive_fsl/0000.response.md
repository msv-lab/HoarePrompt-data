Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the subsequent days' prices are adjusted accordingly. The program fails to account for the price increase due to the tickets purchased on previous days.

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
15
```

Actual Output:
```
17
```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- On the first day, the price is 1. You can buy 2 tickets, and the cost is 2. The prices for the remaining days become [3, 4, 5, 6].
- On the second day, the price is 3. You can buy 2 tickets, and the cost is 6. The prices for the remaining days become [5, 6, 7].
- On the third day, the price is 5. You can buy 1 ticket, and the cost is 5.

The total cost is 2 + 6 + 5 = 13, but the program outputs 17 because it does not correctly adjust the prices for subsequent days after tickets are purchased.
