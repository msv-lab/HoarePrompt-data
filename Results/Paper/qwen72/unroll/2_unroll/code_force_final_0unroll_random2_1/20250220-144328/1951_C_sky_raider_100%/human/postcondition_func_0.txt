The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices for each day. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing each test case, the function resets the state for the next test case, leaving the input variables `n`, `m`, and `a` unchanged, while `k` is reduced to 0 and `t` holds the total number of tickets bought in the current test case.
