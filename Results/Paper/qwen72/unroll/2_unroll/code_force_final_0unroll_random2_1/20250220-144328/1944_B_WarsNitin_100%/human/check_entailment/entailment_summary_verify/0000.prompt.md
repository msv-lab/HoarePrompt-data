You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    
    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1
    
    6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
    
    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` and an array `a` of length `2n` containing integers from 1 to `n` (each appearing exactly twice). For each test case, it splits `a` into two halves `b` and `c`, sorts them, and then constructs two lists `ans1` and `ans2` by selecting elements based on the value of `k`. The first list `ans1` contains elements from the first half of the sorted array `b` that are either duplicates or unique and not part of the last pair of duplicates. The second list `ans2` contains elements from the second half of the sorted array `c` that are duplicates. Both lists are printed, each containing exactly `k` integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the arrays `b` and `c` do not have the required number of elements that can be paired to satisfy the conditions. Specifically, the program assumes that it can always find pairs of elements in `b` and `c` that are equal and can be used to fill `ans1` and `ans2`. However, this is not always true, especially when the elements in `b` and `c` are not distributed in a way that allows for such pairs to be found.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program will sort `b` and `c` to be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` respectively. The program will then try to find pairs of equal elements in `b` and `c` to fill `ans1` and `ans2`. However, since all elements in `b` and `c` are distinct, the program will not be able to find any pairs and will incorrectly output `ans1` and `ans2` with fewer than `2k` elements. This violates the requirement that both `ans1` and `ans2` must have exactly `2k` elements.
