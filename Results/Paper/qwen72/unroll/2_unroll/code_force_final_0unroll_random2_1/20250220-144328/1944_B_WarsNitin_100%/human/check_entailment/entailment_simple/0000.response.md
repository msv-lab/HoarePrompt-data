### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).
   - Both `b` and `c` are then sorted.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized as empty lists to store the elements of the subsets `l` and `r`, respectively.
   - `k` is doubled to `2k` to account for the length of the subsets.

4. **Filling `ans1` from `b`:**
   - The program checks if the first element of `b` is unique and adds it to `l` if it is.
   - It also checks if the last element of `b` is unique and adds it to `l` if it is. If the last two elements are the same, it adds them to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
   - The program then iterates through the middle elements of `b`:
     - If an element is a duplicate (i.e., `b[i] == b[i - 1]`), it adds both duplicates to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
     - If an element is unique, it adds it to `l`.

5. **Filling `ans2` from `c`:**
   - The program iterates through the elements of `c`:
     - If an element is a duplicate (i.e., `c[i] == c[i - 1]`), it adds both duplicates to `ans2` and decreases `k` by 2.

6. **Balancing `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - If there are still elements to be added to `ans1` and `ans2` (i.e., `k > 0`), the program adds elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure they have exactly `2k` elements each.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Unique Elements:**
  - The program incorrectly handles the unique elements in `b` and `c`. It should ensure that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are equal, but the current logic does not guarantee this.
  - The program adds unique elements to `l` and then uses `l` to balance `ans1` and `ans2`, but this does not ensure that the XOR condition is met.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are equal. The logic for handling unique and duplicate elements is flawed and does not guarantee the required condition.

### Correctness: **False**
