The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided context, it is implied that the function operates on an array `a` and two integers `n` and `k`. The array `a` is of length `2n` and contains integers from 1 to `n`, each appearing exactly twice. The integers `n` and `k` have the constraints that `2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4` and `1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋`.

The function returns a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`, and the arrangement of elements in the array `a`.
