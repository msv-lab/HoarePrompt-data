Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of screens required to place all the icons. However, it contains a logical error in the way it handles the placement of the 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.

1. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by 2 and then rounding up. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid size is 5x3 (15 cells per screen). Therefore, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be calculated by dividing `b` by 3 (since each screen can hold up to 3 such icons) and then rounding up.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons by `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct, but the subsequent logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed.
   - The program then calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons by `t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that some of the remaining cells on the current screens can be used to place the 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, each screen can hold up to 3 such icons.
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `b // 3 + (b % 3 > 0)`.

2. **Calculate the remaining cells on these screens:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on these screens can be used to place 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
   - The total number of cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons is `screens_for_2x2 * 15`.
   - The remaining cells available for 1x1 icons is `screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are not enough to place all the 1x1 icons, calculate the additional screens required.
   - The number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is `max(0, (a - remaining_cells) // 15 + ((a - remaining_cells) % 15 > 0))`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = b // 3 + (b % 3 > 0)
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for the given problem.
