The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
