### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - Since `y = 0`, we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The vertices must be chosen such that the diagonals do not intersect.
   - The number of triangles that can be formed from a set of vertices is maximized by ensuring that the vertices are as close to each other as possible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It then reads the `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the number of vertices between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices.
     - If there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - After the loop, it checks if there is exactly one vertex between the last chosen vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
     - If so, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the result as `count + x - 2`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of vertices between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices.
   - It correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking the vertices between the last and the first chosen vertices.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces. This is because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with its adjacent vertices, and the `count` variable already accounts for the additional triangles formed by the gaps between chosen vertices.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x = 2` correctly by outputting `2` (since no additional vertices can be chosen and the only possible triangles are formed by the two chosen vertices and their adjacent vertices).
   - The program also handles the case where `x = n` correctly by outputting `n - 2` (since all vertices are chosen, and the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It correctly identifies the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

**Correctness: True**
