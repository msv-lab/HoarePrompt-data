### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the input for each test case. Each test case is stored as a tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in the list `cases`.

2. **Set Operations:**
   - For each test case, the program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to create `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, which contain only the elements that are less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Set Differences and Intersections:**
   - The program calculates the elements that are present only in `a` (`only_a`), only in `b` (`only_b`), and in both `a` and `b` (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements that are relevant (`total_distinct`). If this number is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all integers from 1 to `k`, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating that it is possible to choose the required elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks all necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. The conditions and set operations are logically sound and cover all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
