You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

- Program:
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the conditions for each tuple in `cases` are met. Specifically, 'YES' is appended to `results` if the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` and the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` are both less than or equal to `k // 2`, and the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The `cases` list remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` (`n` and `m`), and the even number `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and stores them in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements of arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both arrays (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Condition 1:** If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 2:** Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 3:** If the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` (i.e., `total_distinct`) is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 4:** If none of the above conditions are met, it means it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included, so the program appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
- **Condition 1 and Condition 2:** These conditions ensure that there are enough unique elements in each array to form the required subset of size `k // 2`.
- **Condition 3:** This condition ensures that the total number of distinct elements from both arrays is at least `k`, which is necessary to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
- **Condition 4:** If the above conditions are not violated, the program correctly concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic, ensuring that it can determine whether it is possible to choose the required elements for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
