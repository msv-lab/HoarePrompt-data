Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 10^9). It then prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the absolute difference is odd. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate result ('Bob' or 'Alice') has been printed for each test case. **
