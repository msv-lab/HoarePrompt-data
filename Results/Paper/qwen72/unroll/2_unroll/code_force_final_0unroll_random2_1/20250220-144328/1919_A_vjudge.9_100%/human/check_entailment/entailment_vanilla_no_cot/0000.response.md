Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules provided. The program checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even. If it is, the program outputs "Bob"; otherwise, it outputs "Alice". However, this logic is flawed.

The correct logic to determine the winner is based on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins and the initial difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's the correct approach:

1. **Total Number of Coins**: The total number of coins (a + b) will be reduced by 1 in each turn. Therefore, the game will end after (a + b) turns.
2. **Turns and Parity**: Alice makes the first move, so she will play on odd-numbered turns (1, 3, 5, ...), and Bob will play on even-numbered turns (2, 4, 6, ...).
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who makes the last move (i.e., the move that reduces the total number of coins to 0) wins. This means the player who plays on the (a + b)-th turn will win.

To determine the winner:
- If (a + b) is odd, Alice will make the last move and win.
- If (a + b) is even, Bob will make the last move and win.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner based on the rules of the game.
