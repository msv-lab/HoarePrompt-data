Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The loop has printed 'Bob' for test cases where the absolute difference between a and b is even, and 'Alice' for test cases where the absolute difference between a and b is odd.**
