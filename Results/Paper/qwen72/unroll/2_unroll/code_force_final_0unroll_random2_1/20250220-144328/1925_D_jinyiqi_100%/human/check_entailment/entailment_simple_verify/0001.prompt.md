You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of children (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is the number of pairs of friends (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k is the number of excursions (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5). Additionally, m lines follow, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) and their initial friendship value (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function should return an integer for each test case, which is the answer to the problem modulo (10^9 + 7).

    #State: The function `func` processes all test cases and prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are updated and used within each iteration of the loop, but their values are reset for each new test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the state of these variables is not retained and is irrelevant. The only relevant state is the number of test cases `t`, which remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
   - It adds each `f` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (i.e., \(\binom{n}{2}\)).
   - This is done using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
     - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
     - `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` and prints it.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correct.
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen is the sum of the initial friendship values multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends, plus the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions is \(\frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{n(n-1)}\).
  - Combining these, the expected value is \(\frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}\).

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the constraints.
  - The use of `pow(q, -1, M)` to compute the modular inverse is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (i.e., `m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0 in this case.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
