Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `m` lines of friendship data. It calculates and prints an integer result for each test case, which is the answer to a specific problem modulo (10^9 + 7). The function does not return any values; instead, it directly prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any state from the processed test cases, and the only variable that remains unchanged is the number of test cases `t`. **
