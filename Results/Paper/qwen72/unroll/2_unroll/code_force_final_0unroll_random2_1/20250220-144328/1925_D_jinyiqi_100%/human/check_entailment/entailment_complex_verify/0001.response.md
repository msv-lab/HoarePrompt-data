### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correctly described and implemented in the code.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
   - It adds each `f` to `sum_f`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correctly described and implemented in the code.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (i.e., \(\binom{n}{2}\)).
   - This is done using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correctly described and implemented in the code.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
     - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
     - `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The formula for `p` is correct, but the formula for `q` is incorrect. The denominator should be `cn2` (not `cn2 ** 2`), because the probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase over `k` excursions, all divided by the number of pairs \(\binom{n}{2}\).

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correctly described and implemented in the code.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` and prints it.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correctly described and implemented in the code, but the incorrect denominator `q` will lead to incorrect results.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula for the numerator `p` is correct.
  - The formula for the denominator `q` is incorrect. It should be `cn2` instead of `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the constraints.
  - The use of `pow(q, -1, M)` to compute the modular inverse is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (i.e., `m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0 in this case.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula for the denominator `q`. The correct formula for `q` should be `cn2` instead of `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
