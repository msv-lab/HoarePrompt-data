### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The function calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends (`sum_f`).
   - This is done by iterating over the `m` pairs and adding their friendship values to `sum_f`.

3. **Combinations Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), stored in `cn2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - The term \( 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} \) accounts for the initial friendship values of the pairs being chosen.
   - The term \( m \times k \times (k - 1) \) accounts for the increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen multiple times.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The function simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`, where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Finally, it prints the result of \( p \times q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula for `p` and `q` is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
- The term \( 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} \) is correct because it represents the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
- The term \( m \times k \times (k - 1) \) is correct because it represents the increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen multiple times. Each pair can be chosen in \( k \) excursions, and each time it is chosen, its value increases by 1, leading to a total increase of \( k \times (k - 1) \) for each pair.
- The denominator \( 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2 \) is correct because it represents the total number of possible pairs squared, multiplied by 2 to account for the equiprobable and independent selection of pairs.

### Correctness:
