Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to compute `p` and `q` is incorrect.

Here's the correct approach:

1. **Initial Friendship Value Contribution**: For each excursion, the expected contribution of the initial friendship value of a pair is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs. This is because each pair is chosen with equal probability.

2. **Incremental Friendship Value Contribution**: For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected number of times a specific pair of friends is chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is `k * (k - 1) / (2 * (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

3. **Total Expected Value**: The total expected value is the sum of the initial contributions and the incremental contributions for all pairs of friends.

The correct formula for `p` and `q` should be:
- `p = k * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // 2`
- `q = n * (n - 1) // 2`

Here's the corrected program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        p = k * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // 2
        q = cn2
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p = p // gcd
        q = q // gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Initial Contribution**: `k * sum_f` because each of the `k` excursions contributes the initial sum of friendship values.
- **Incremental Contribution**: `m * k * (k - 1) // 2` because each pair of friends can be chosen `k` times, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is `k / cn2`. The total expected increase in friendship value for all pairs is `m * (k * (k - 1) / 2) / cn2`.

By using the correct formula, the program will produce the correct expected value for the sum of friendship values.
