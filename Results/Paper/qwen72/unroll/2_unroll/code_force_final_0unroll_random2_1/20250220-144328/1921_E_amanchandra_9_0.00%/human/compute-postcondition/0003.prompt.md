You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The inputs are such that `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips do not coincide (`x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`). Additionally, the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop processes all test cases and prints the result for each case as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset and re-assigned for each test case, and their final values are the ones from the last test case processed. The loop itself does not modify any other variables outside its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, where `h` and `w` define the dimensions of a grid, and `x_a`, `y_a` and `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on this grid. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
