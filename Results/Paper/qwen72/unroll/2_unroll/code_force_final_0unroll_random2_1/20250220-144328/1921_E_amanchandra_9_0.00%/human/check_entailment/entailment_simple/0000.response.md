### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function first checks if `xa > xb`. If Alice's chip is already in a row below Bob's chip, the game will end in a draw because Bob cannot move down to Alice's row, and Alice cannot move up to Bob's row. This is a correct condition.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the number of moves `x` that Alice and Bob can make to potentially meet. This is done using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

4. **Odd and Even Distance Handling**:
   - **Odd Distance**: If the distance between Alice's and Bob's chips is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice's chip can be after `x` moves. It then checks if Alice's chip can be in a position that allows her to win by comparing `ya` with `l` and `r`.
   - **Even Distance**: If the distance is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob's chip can be after `x` moves. It then checks if Bob's chip can be in a position that allows him to win by comparing `yb` with `l` and `r`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Odd Distance**: The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if Alice can move to a position where she can win. This is correct because Alice can move `x + 1` steps in either direction to potentially win.
- **Even Distance**: The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if Bob can move to a position where he can win. This is correct because Bob can move `x` steps in either direction to potentially win.

### Potential Issues:
- **Range Calculation**: The range `l` and `r` are calculated correctly to ensure they stay within the board boundaries.
- **Winning Conditions**: The winning conditions for Alice and Bob are correctly implemented based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given conditions and constraints. It processes each test case independently and prints the correct result based on the logic provided.
