The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". The function returns the result for each test case based on the input values of `n` and `s`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then returns the result for each test case based on the input values of `n` and `s`.**
