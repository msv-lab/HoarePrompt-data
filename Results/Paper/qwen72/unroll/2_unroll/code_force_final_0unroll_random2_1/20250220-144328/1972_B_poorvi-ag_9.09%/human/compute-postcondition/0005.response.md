The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The variable `i` is the iterator that will take on the values of the elements in `results` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, the variable `results` is a list that should contain 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions provided. However, for the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, `i` is the first element in `results`**
