#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". The function should read the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) from the input, and for each test case, it should read n and s.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions in the loop. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case. If the length of the string `s` in a test case is even, the result is 'no'. If the length is odd and the number of 'U' characters is greater than the number of 'D' characters, the result is 'yes'. Otherwise, the result is 'no'. The variable `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged as a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions in the loop. The variable `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines and prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the following conditions: if `n` is even, the result is 'no'; if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, the result is 'yes'; otherwise, the result is 'no'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the results for all test cases.
