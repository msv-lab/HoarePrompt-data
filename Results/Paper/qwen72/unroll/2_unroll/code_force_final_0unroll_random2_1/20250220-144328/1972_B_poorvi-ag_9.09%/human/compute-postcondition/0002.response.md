The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
