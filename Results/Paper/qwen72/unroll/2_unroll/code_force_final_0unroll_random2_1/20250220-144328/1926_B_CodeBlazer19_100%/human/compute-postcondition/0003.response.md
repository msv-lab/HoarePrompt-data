The function `func` accepts a parameter `grid`. `grid` is a 2D list of size n x n, where each element is either '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1. The function returns a string indicating whether the shape formed by the '1's is a "triangle" or a "square".
