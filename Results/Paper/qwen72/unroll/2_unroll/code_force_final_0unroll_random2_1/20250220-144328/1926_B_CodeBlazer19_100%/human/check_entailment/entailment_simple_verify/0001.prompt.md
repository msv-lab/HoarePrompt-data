You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a 2D list `grid` of size n x n where each element is either '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: The function will print 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each iteration of the loop based on the input grid. The variables `a` and `b` will be reset to their initial values (`a = 0` and `b = ''`) at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be `0` and `''` respectively, and the variable `t` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads `n` lines of input for each grid.

2. **Shape Identification**:
   - The program uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., if `a` was set to 'TRIANGLE' at any point), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description. It only checks if any row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1', and the pattern of '1's must be checked to confirm it is a triangle.
   - The program also does not check the specific pattern required for a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle should have rows with an increasing or decreasing number of '1's in a specific pattern (2*i-1), and a square should have rows with a consistent number of '1's (k).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, the program should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of 1, 3, 5, ..., 2*i-1, or the reverse pattern.
   - To correctly identify a square, the program should check if each row has the same number of '1's, and these '1's are aligned in a consistent manner.

Given these flaws, the program is incorrect.
