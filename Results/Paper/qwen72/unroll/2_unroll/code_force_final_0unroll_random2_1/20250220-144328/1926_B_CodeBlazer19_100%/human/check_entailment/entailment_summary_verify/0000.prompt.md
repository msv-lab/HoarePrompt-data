You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple 2D grids from user input, where each grid is of size n x n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and contains elements '0' or '1'. For each grid, it determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's is a "TRIANGLE" or a "SQUARE". The function does not return any value. After processing all grids, the variables `a` and `b` are reset to their initial values (`a = 0` and `b = ''`) at the start of each iteration, and the variable `t` (the number of grids) remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1111
0110
0110
0000
```

This input represents a square of size 2 (the 1s form a 2x2 square in the middle of the grid). However, the program will incorrectly output "TRIANGLE" because it only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and does not properly check the structure of the square.

The program should be more sophisticated to correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description. It needs to check the structure of the 1s in the grid to determine if they form a triangle or a square, not just the count of 1s in each row.
