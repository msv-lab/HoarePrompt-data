The function `func` reads multiple 2D grids from user input, where each grid is of size n x n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and contains elements '0' or '1'. For each grid, it determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's is a "TRIANGLE" or a "SQUARE". The function does not return any value. After processing all grids, the variables `a` and `b` are reset to their initial values (`a = 0` and `b = ''`) at the start of each iteration, and the variable `t` (the number of grids) remains unchanged.
