Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - However, the length `k * n` is not necessarily the smallest possible length that can guarantee all subsequences are included.
   - For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The solution constructs the string `baab`, which is of length 4. However, the string `aabb` is also a valid solution and is of the same length.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the solution constructs the string `abcbac`, which is of length 6. However, a shorter valid string is `abacbc`, which is also of length 6 but is more compact in terms of character distribution.

4. **Checking the Constraints**:
   - The constraints are `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.
   - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`, which is within the feasible range given the constraints.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output is `ab`, which contains all possible strings of length 1 using the first 2 characters (`a` and `b`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output is `aa`, which contains the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 character (`a`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `baab`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `abcbac`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the solution does generate a string `s` that contains all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters as subsequences, it does not necessarily generate the shortest possible string.
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the length `k * n` is the smallest possible length that can guarantee all subsequences are included. This is not always true, as there can be more compact constructions.

Therefore, the given program is not correct in terms of generating the shortest possible string, even though it does generate a valid string.

Final: **False**
