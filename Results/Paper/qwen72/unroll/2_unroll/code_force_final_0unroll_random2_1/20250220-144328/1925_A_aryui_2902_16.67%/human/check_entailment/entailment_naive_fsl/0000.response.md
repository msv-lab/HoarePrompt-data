Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the generated string `s`.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program generates the string `abcbac`. However, the string `ac` (formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets) does not occur as a subsequence in `abcbac`. The correct string should be something like `abcabc` to ensure that all possible strings of length 2 using `a`, `b`, and `c` occur as subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
