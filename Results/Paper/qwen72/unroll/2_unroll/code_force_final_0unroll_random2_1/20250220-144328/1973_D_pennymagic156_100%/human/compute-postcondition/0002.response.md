To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized to `n` at the start of the loop.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the upper bound of the loop and must be a positive integer.
3. **Step value `-1`**: This means the loop will decrement `i` by 1 each iteration until `i` is less than or equal to 0.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and `v` is 1, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already guaranteed to be a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once.

However, the loop head does not mention `k` or `v`, so they do not need to be adjusted. The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which is set to `n` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
