The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1)` will execute if the range from 1 to `n // k + 1` is valid and contains at least one element. This means that `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n // k + 1` is greater than 1. This can be achieved if `n // k` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least `k`.

Additionally, `i` should start at 1, as specified by the range.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `n` must be at least `k`, `i` is 1, `v` is 1**
