Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4; `v` is 1.** 

The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `v`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they were returned by `func_3()` and are positive integers within the specified range.
