Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_5()`. This is appropriate for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem.

2. **Function `func_5`**:
   - **Initial Query**: The function `func_5` first determines the value of `v` by iterating from `n` down to 1. For each `i`, it queries `f(1, r) = i * n` and checks if the response is `n`. If it is, `v` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. This step is intended to find the maximum possible value of `f(1, r)` that can be achieved by the entire array.
   - **Subarray Queries**: After determining `v`, the function iterates from 1 to `n // k + 1` to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`. For each `i`, it performs queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` and updates `l` accordingly. If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays, it prints the result `i * v` and returns.
   - **Final Check**: If no such `m` is found, it prints `! -1` and returns.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a list of integers from the input. It is not used in the program, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

4. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads an integer from the input. It is used to read the responses to the queries made by `func_5`.

5. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads a list of integers from the input and returns an iterator. It is used to read the values of `n` and `k` at the beginning of each test case in `func_5`.

6. **Function `func_4`**: This function reads a string from the input and strips leading and trailing whitespace. It is not used in the program, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

7. **Query and Response Handling**: The program correctly handles the interactive nature of the problem by flushing the output after each query and reading the response before making the next query.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `k = 1`, the program should find `m` as `f(1, n)`. The initial query loop should correctly identify the maximum value of `f(1, r)` for the entire array.
   - For `k > 1`, the program should find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)`. The subarray query loop should correctly identify this value or determine that no such `m` exists.

9. **Query Limit**: The program makes at most `2n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

10. **Correctness of Logic**:
    - The initial query loop correctly identifies the maximum possible value of `f(1, r)` for the entire array.
    - The subarray query loop correctly attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)`.
    - The program correctly handles the case where no such `m` exists by printing `! -1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and handles the interactive nature of the problem appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
