Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a palindrome array, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `prev` is 0, `idx` is (n - 1) // 2.**

The value of `idx` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n - 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
