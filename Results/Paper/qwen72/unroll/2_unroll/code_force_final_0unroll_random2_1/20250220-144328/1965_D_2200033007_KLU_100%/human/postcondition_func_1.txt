The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers, where each integer represents the sum of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindrome array. It processes this list to return a new list `odds` containing unique integers. These integers are the sums of subarrays from the hidden palindrome array that do not have a matching sum in the list `cts`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `odds` contains only those unique sums that do not have a duplicate in `cts`.
