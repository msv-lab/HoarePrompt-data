Output State: **The program does not return any value.**

The provided Python code snippet is a return statement without any value specified. In Python, if a return statement does not specify a value, it returns `None` by default. However, since the return statement is provided without any value, it simply ends the function execution without returning any value explicitly. Therefore, the output state is that the program does not return any value.
