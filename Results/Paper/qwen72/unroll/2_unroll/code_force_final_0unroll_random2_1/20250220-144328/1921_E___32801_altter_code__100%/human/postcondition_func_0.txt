The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from the input, representing the dimensions of a board (`n`, `m`) and the initial positions of two chips (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`). It then determines the outcome of a game based on the positions of the chips and prints one of three possible results: 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and one of the outcomes has been printed, but no variables are modified outside the function's scope.
