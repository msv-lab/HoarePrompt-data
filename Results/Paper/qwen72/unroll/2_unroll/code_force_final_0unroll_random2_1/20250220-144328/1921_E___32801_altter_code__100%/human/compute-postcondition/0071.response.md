Output State: **`r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `a` is `y1 - 1` (which is 0), `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `c` is `y2 - 1`. `x2` is still greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is still even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. The current value of `y1` is 1, and `y2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `c` is assigned the value `y2 - 1`.
- `y2` is `r[5] - a`, and since `a` is `y1 - 1` (which is 0 because `y1` is 1), `y2` is `r[5]`.
- Therefore, `c` is `r[5] - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
