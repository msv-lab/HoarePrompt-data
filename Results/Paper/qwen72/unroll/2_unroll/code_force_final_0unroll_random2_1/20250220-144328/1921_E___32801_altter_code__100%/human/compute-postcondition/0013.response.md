Output State: **`y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is greater than `x1 + 1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is greater than `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by 1.
- The initial condition that `x2` is greater than `x1` remains valid, but now `x2` is greater than `x1 + 1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` was initially an odd number. After incrementing `x1` by 1, the difference becomes even.
- The conditions involving `y1` and `y2` remain unchanged.
