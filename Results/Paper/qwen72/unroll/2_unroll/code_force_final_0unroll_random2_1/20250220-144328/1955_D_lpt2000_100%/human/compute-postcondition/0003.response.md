The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases, each containing integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with each test case having the following constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the arrays `a` and `b` contain integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each case. The exact nature of the return value is not specified, but it is expected to be based on the input parameters and arrays provided.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters and arrays, with the number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 10^4 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.**
