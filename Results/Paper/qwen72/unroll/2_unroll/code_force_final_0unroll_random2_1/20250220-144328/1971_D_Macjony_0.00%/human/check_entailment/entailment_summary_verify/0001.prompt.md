You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and processes it to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1', excluding the transition from '0' to '1' if it occurs. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` holding the values from the last test case. Specifically, `i` will be `t-1`, `s` will be the last input binary string, `count` will be the count of transitions for the last input string, `flag` will be `True` if the last input string contained a transition from '0' to '1', and `j` will be the length of the last input string minus 1. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into, such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop with index `j`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the `count`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies transitions between different characters in the string.
   - However, the logic for counting the pieces is flawed. The program increments `count` for every transition, but it should only increment `count` when transitioning from '1' to '0' because each such transition indicates a new piece is needed.
   - The `flag` is used to handle the case where the string transitions from '0' to '1', but this is not necessary for the correct solution.
   - The program incorrectly decrements `count` by 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found, which is not the right approach.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct approach is to count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' because each such transition indicates a new piece is needed.
   - If there are no '1' to '0' transitions, the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.
   - The correct count should be the number of '1' to '0' transitions plus one.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        for j in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[j] == '1' and s[j + 1] == '0':
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected program initializes `count` to 1.
- It iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` only when it finds a transition from '1' to '0'.
- This ensures that the minimum number of pieces is correctly counted.
- The program then prints the `count` for each test case.
