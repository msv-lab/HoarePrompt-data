Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

The problem requires the minimum number of pieces such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a string where all '0's come before all '1's. The program, however, increments the count every time it encounters a change in the character (from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'), which does not necessarily lead to the correct number of pieces needed.

For example, consider the test case `0110`:
- The program will count 3 pieces because it sees changes at positions 0-1 and 2-3.
- However, the correct answer is 2, as you can cut the string into `01` and `10`, and then rearrange these pieces to form `0011`.

The correct approach should be to count the number of '1's that appear before any '0' in the string, as these '1's will each need to be in a separate piece to ensure they can be moved to the end of the sorted string. If there are no '1's before any '0', the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        for j in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[j] == '1' and s[j + 1] == '0':
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

This version correctly counts the number of times a '1' appears before a '0', which gives the minimum number of pieces required.
