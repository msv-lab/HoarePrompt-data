Output State: **`times` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 for each integer in the list, `check` is 2147483647.** 

The value of `check` is now 2147483647, which is the result of the expression `2 ** 31 - 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
