The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be initialized by the loop itself. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
