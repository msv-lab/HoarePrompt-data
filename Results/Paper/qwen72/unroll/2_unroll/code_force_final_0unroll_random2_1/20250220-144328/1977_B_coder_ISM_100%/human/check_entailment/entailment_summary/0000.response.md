### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with possible modifications.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The function iterates through the first 30 bits of `x` (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)) and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether the bit is set or not. This correctly generates the binary representation of `x`.

3. **Modification Rules:**
   - The function then iterates through the list `s` to apply the rules:
     - If a '1' is followed by another '1' and `flag` is 0, it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets `flag` to 1. This ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present.
     - If `flag` is 1 and the current element is '0', it changes the '0' to '1' and resets `flag` to 0.
     - If `flag` is 1 and the current element is '1', it changes the '1' to '0'.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is still 1, it checks the last element of `s`:
     - If the last element is '0', it changes it to '1'.
     - If the last element is not '0', it changes it to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The function makes a final pass through the list to ensure that no '1' is followed by a '-1'. If such a pair is found, it changes the '-1' to '0' and the preceding '1' to '-1'.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of the modified list `s` and the elements of `s`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly generates the binary representation of `x` and applies the rules to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present.
- The final adjustments ensure that the array meets the requirement that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\).
- The function handles the edge cases where the last bit needs to be adjusted or an additional bit needs to be appended.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It generates a valid array `a` for each test case and prints the required output.
