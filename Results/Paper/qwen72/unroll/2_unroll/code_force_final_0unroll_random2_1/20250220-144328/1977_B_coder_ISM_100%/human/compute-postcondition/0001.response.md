The only objects in the loop head are the variables `nalla` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `x` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0**
