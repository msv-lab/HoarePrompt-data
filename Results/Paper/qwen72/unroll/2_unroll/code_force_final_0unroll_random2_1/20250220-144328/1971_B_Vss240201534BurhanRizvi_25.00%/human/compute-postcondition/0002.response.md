Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input provided. For each iteration, a string `s` will be read from the input, and a shuffled version `s2` of `s` will be created. If `s2` is different from `s`, 'Yes' will be printed followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, 'No' will be printed. The variables `s` and `s2` will be updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.**
