The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of integers `a` (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
