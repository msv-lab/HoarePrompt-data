To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`case`**: This variable will take on the value of each tuple in `test_cases` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `case` is not defined, but it will be assigned the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop begins.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which indicates the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple. The variable `case` will be assigned the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
