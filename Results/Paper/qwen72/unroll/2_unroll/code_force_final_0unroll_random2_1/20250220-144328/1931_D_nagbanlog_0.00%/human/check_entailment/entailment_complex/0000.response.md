Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for each test case. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's break down the function and check if it correctly implements the logic to find these beautiful pairs:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from the `params` key of the dictionary, and `a` is extracted from the `array` key.
   - `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders \((\text{mod\_x}, \text{mod\_y})\).

2. **Processing Each Number in the Array**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` are calculated when `num` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - The required remainders for a beautiful pair are calculated:
     - `required_mod_x` is \((x - \text{mod\_x}) \% x\). This is because for \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \(\text{mod\_x} + \text{mod\_x\_j} \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), which implies \(\text{mod\_x\_j} \equiv -\text{mod\_x} \pmod{x}\).
     - `required_mod_y` is \(\text{mod\_y}\). This is because for \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \(\text{mod\_y} - \text{mod\_y\_j} \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), which implies \(\text{mod\_y\_j} \equiv \text{mod\_y} \pmod{y}\).

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - If the pair \((\text{required\_mod\_x}, \text{required\_mod\_y})\) is already in the `freq` dictionary, it means there are some numbers in the array that, when paired with the current `num`, form a beautiful pair. The count of such pairs is added to `beautiful_count`.
   - The current pair \((\text{mod\_x}, \text{mod\_y})\) is then added to the `freq` dictionary, or its count is incremented if it already exists.

4. **Output and Return**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, the `beautiful_count` is printed and appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the function returns the `results` list.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition for a beautiful pair is that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The function correctly calculates the required remainders for the sum condition but incorrectly uses the same remainder for the difference condition. Specifically, the line:
```python
required_mod_y = mod_y
```
is incorrect. It should be:
```python
required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
```
This is because for \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \(\text{mod\_y} - \text{mod\_y\_j} \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), which implies \(\text{mod\_y\_j} \equiv \text{mod\_y} \pmod{y}\).

Given this error, the function will not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
