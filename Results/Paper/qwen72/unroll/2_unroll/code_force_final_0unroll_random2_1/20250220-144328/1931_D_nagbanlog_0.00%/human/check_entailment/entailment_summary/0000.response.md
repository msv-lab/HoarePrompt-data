Reasoning:  
The provided program is almost correct but contains a small mistake in the logic used to determine "beautiful pairs." According to the problem description, a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if both conditions are met:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

However, the program incorrectly checks the second condition as \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(y\). Instead, it should check \(a_i - a_j\) for divisibility by \(y\).

Let's break down the correct logic:
1. For the sum condition, \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need \(a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x \equiv 0 \mod x\). This means \(a_j \mod x \equiv -a_i \mod x\).
2. For the difference condition, \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need \(a_i \mod y - a_j \mod y \equiv 0 \mod y\). This means \(a_i \mod y \equiv a_j \mod y\).

The program should store the frequency of pairs \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\) and then count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

However, the second condition in the program is incorrect. It should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **False**
