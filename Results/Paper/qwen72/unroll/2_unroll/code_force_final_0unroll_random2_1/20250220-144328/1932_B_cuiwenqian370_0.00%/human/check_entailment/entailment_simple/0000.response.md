### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, which is supposed to represent the periodicities of the signs.
   - However, the function is designed to handle a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. This does not align with the problem description, which specifies that the input should be a list of integers representing the periodicities.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected up to each index, considering the constraints imposed by '*' signs. This is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the number of test cases `t` and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function then prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Mismatch Between Problem and Implementation**:
   - The problem requires finding the year when the n-th sign occurs, which involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.
   - The provided functions do not perform any LCM calculation. Instead, they are designed to handle a different problem involving collecting '@' signs and avoiding '*' signs, which is not related to the given problem description.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The functions provided do not solve the problem as described. They are designed for a different problem and do not correctly handle the periodicity of signs or the sequential occurrence requirement.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of the signs. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not perform the necessary calculations to find the LCM of the periodicities.
