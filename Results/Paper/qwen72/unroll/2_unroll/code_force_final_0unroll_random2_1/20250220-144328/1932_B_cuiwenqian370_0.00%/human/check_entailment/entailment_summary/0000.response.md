### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The provided functions, however, do not seem to address this problem correctly. Let's break down the functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to process a list of strings (`path`), where each string is either `'@'`, `'*'`, or a representation of a sign's periodicity.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `'@'` signs that can be collected while traversing the `path`, with the constraint that encountering a `'*'` sign results in an immediate penalty represented by `-inf`.
   - This function is not relevant to the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs. The problem does not involve collecting `'@'` signs or dealing with penalties for `'*'` signs. Instead, it involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, starting from the first sign and ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from the standard input (stdin) and processes it to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - The function `func_2` is also not correctly solving the problem because it is using `func_1`, which is not designed to find the year of the n-th sign.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The correct approach involves:

1. Reading the input to get the number of test cases and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
2. For each test case, calculate the year in which the n-th sign occurs by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, starting from the first sign and ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    year = periods[0]
    for period in periods[1:]:
        year = lcm(year, period)
    return year

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()  # This would read from stdin and print the results
```

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
