The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input (stdin) and processes it. Since the function signature does not provide any parameters and the output is not specified, we can infer that the function's behavior is entirely dependent on the input it reads from stdin. However, without more specific information about what the function does with the input or what it returns, we can only describe the general behavior.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin and processes it, but the specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
