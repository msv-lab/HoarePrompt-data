Postcondition: **`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of `path` is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. `dp` is a list of length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf` and `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 0. The rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then the values of `dp[1]` are as described above.**
