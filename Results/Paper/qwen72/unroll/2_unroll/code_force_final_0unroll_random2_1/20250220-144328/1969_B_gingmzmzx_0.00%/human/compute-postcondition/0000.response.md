Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string s. The input to the function should be a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
