### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of operations.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to the correct position.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the minimum total cost to sort the binary string is based on the idea of counting the number of cyclic shifts needed to move each `0` to the left of any `1` that appears before it.
- The program correctly accounts for the cost of each operation by summing up the necessary shifts.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `10` can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0000`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The string `0000` is already sorted, so no operations are needed.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `11000`
  - Output: `9`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves three operations, each costing 3.
- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `101011`
  - Output: `5`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 5.
- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `01101001`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 11.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles all the test cases correctly and follows the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
