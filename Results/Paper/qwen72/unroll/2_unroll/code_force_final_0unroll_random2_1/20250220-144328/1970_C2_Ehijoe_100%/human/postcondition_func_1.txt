The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from the input. It then reads `n-1` pairs of integers representing edges between nodes and constructs a `defaultdict` called `nodes` where each key is a node and each value is a list of its neighbors. The function identifies all nodes with exactly one neighbor and stores them in a `deque` called `leaves`. It reads another integer `start` from the input, which is a node, and calls `func_1` with `nodes` and `start`. If `func_1` returns a truthy value, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione". After the function concludes, `n` and `t` retain their initial values, `edges` remains an empty list, `nodes` is a populated `defaultdict` of node neighbors, `start` is the integer value provided by the user, `empty` remains True, and `leaves` contains all nodes with exactly one neighbor.
