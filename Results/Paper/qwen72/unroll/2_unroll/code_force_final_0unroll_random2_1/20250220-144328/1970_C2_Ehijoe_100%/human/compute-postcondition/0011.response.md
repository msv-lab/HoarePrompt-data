Postcondition: **`n` and `t` retain their initial values, `edges` remains an empty list, `nodes` retains its initial state as a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `start` is now the integer value provided by the user, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is now a deque containing all the nodes that have exactly one neighbor, `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is not None or False (i.e., `moves` is truthy).**
