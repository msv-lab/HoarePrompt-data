Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine who wins each round if both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the player starting from node `start` can force a win.
   - If the node `start` has only one neighbor (which is `parent`), it means the node is a leaf, and the player who starts from this node will lose because they have no valid move.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors of `start` (excluding `parent`) to see if any of them can force a loss for the opponent.
   - The function returns `True` if there is at least one neighbor that can force a loss for the opponent, otherwise it returns `False`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
   - It reads `n` and `t` from the input, where `t` is always 1.
   - It reads `n-1` edges and constructs the adjacency list `nodes`.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a `deque` called `leaves`.
   - It reads the starting node `start` for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` with the constructed tree and the starting node.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Ron", indicating that Ron can force a win.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "Hermione", indicating that Hermione can force a win.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly determines if a player starting from a given node can force a win by checking if the node is a leaf or if any of its neighbors can force a loss for the opponent.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner based on the result of `func_1`.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description and the rules of the game.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
