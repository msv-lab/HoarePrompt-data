Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no facing-up coins correctly. According to the problem description, if there are no facing-up coins, the player loses. However, the function `func_1` only checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins and does not consider the case where there are no facing-up coins at all. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
DDDDD
```

The program will output "NO" because the number of 'U' coins is 0, which is even. However, the correct output should be "YES" because Alice loses immediately since there are no facing-up coins to choose from, and the game ends with Bob winning by default. This is a clear case where the program does not follow the problem description.
