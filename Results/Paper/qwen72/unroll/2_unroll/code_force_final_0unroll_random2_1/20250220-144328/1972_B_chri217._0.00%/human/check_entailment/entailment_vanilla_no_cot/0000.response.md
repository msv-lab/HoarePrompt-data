Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key observation is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally, because Alice starts first and can always leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, eventually leading to a situation where Bob has no valid move. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one left with no valid move.

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output based on this logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
