You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should process multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should internally handle the input for multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided at the beginning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states, as `t` will have been decremented to 0, `n` will have the value of the last test case's integer input, and `a` will have the list of integers from the last test case's input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function internally processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the results for each test case based on the processing of the provided integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
