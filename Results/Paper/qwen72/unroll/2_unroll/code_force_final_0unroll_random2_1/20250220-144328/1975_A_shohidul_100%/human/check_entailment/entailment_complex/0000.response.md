### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function. If it is, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if the array is already sorted, no operations are needed.

3. **Split and Swap Check:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the function attempts to find a split point `i` such that the array can be split into two parts: `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`. It then checks if the array `y + x` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `y`.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new array `y` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The function has a logical flaw in the way it handles the split and swap operation. Specifically, it only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `y`, and if `y` is sorted. However, it should also check if the last element of the new array `y` is less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]` to ensure the entire concatenated array `y + x` is sorted.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping, the function should:
     - Find the first index `i` where the array is not sorted.
     - Check if the subarray `a[i:] + a[:i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness:
Given the logical flaw in the split and swap check, the program is **incorrect**. The function does not correctly handle the case where the split and swap operation can make the array non-decreasing.

### Correctness: **False**
