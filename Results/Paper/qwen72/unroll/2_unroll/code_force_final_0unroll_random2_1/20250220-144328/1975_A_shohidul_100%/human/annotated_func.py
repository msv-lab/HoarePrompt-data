#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should process multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should internally handle the input for multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided at the beginning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states, as `t` will have been decremented to 0, `n` will have the value of the last test case's integer input, and `a` will have the list of integers from the last test case's input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it checks if the list is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state of the program includes the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` being updated to the values from the last test case.
