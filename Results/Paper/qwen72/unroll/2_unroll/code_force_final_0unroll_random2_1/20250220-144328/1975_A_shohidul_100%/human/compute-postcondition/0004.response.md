Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it checks if the list is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state of the program includes the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` being updated to the values from the last test case. **
