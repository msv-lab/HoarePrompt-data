To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the `ans` list.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- Each element of `ans` represents the difference between:
  - The sum of indices of all '<' characters to the right of the current index.
  - The sum of indices of all '>' characters to the left of the current index.
- This difference is adjusted by the total length of the string `n` and the initial state of the lists `preOne` and `suffZero`.
- The lists `preOne` and `suffZero` are empty.
- `totalOne` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Empty `preOne` and `suffZero` Lists**:
   - Since `preOne` and `suffZero` are empty, they do not contribute to any calculations in the `ans` list.

2. **`totalOne` is 0**:
   - `totalOne` is 0, which means there are no '>' characters in the string.

3. **`ans` List Calculation**:
   - Each element of `ans` is calculated based on the sum of indices of '<' characters to the right and the sum of indices of '>' characters to the left.
   - Since `totalOne` is 0, there are no '>' characters to the left of any index.
   - Therefore, the sum of indices of '>' characters to the left of any index is 0.
   - The sum of indices of '<' characters to the right of any index will depend on the positions of '<' characters in the string.

4. **Adjustment by `n`**:
   - The adjustment by `n` (the total length of the string) is applied to each element of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
- Without knowing the exact positions of '<' characters in the string, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`.
- However, we can describe the elements of `ans` as the difference between the sum of indices of '<' characters to the right of the current index and 0 (since there are no '>' characters), adjusted by the total length of the string `n`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, where each element is the difference between the sum of indices of all '<' characters to the right of the current index and 0, adjusted by the total length of the string `n`.

Output: **[difference between the sum of indices of '<' to the right and 0, adjusted by n] (for each element in the ans list)**

This description is the most precise we can provide given the initial state and the structure of the problem.
