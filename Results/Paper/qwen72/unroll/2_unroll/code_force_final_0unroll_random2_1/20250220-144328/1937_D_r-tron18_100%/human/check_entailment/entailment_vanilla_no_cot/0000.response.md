Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` is overly complex and does not accurately simulate the movement of the pinball as specified in the problem description. The program seems to be attempting to use prefix and suffix sums to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, but it does not correctly account for the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters in the grid.

To correctly solve this problem, a simpler approach would be to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position, keeping track of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid and the changes in the grid's characters. Here is a more straightforward approach:

```python
def simulate_pinball(s):
    n = len(s)
    left_time = [0] * n
    right_time = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate time to leave the grid from each cell moving left
    time = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '<':
            left_time[i] = time
            time += 1
        else:
            time = 0
    
    # Calculate time to leave the grid from each cell moving right
    time = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '>':
            right_time[i] = time
            time += 1
        else:
            time = 0
    
    # Calculate the final answer for each cell
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '<':
            ans.append(i + 1 + right_time[i])
        else:
            ans.append(n - i + left_time[i])
    
    return ans

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        s = test_cases[_][1]
        results.append(simulate_pinball(s))
    
    for result in results:
        print(*result)

# Example usage
t = 3
test_cases = [
    (3, "><<"),
    (4, "<<<<"),
    (6, "<><<<")
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

This approach correctly simulates the pinball's movement and calculates the time it takes to leave the grid for each starting position. The `simulate_pinball` function computes the time to leave the grid from each cell, and the `solve` function processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
