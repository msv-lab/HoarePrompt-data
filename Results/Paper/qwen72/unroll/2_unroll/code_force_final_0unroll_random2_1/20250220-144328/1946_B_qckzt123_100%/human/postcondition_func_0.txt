The function reads a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it takes the number of elements `n` and a multiplier `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It computes a value `ans` based on the sum of the elements in `a` and the maximum subarray sum found in `a`, then applies a series of transformations involving the multiplier `k` and a modulus operation. Finally, it prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
