### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using a dynamic programming approach.
   - It initializes `t` and `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `a`, updating `tmp` to be the sum of the current subarray.
   - If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets `tmp` to 0 because a negative sum would not contribute to the maximum sum.
   - It updates `t` to be the maximum of `t` and `tmp`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - The `+ MOD` and `% MOD` operations ensure that the result is non-negative and within the modulo range.

5. **Operations Loop:**
   - The program then performs `k - 1` operations.
   - In each operation, it doubles the value of `t` and takes the result modulo `MOD`.
   - It adds this doubled value to `ans` and takes the result modulo `MOD`.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated using the `sum` function.

- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The maximum subarray sum `t` is correctly calculated using a dynamic programming approach. This approach ensures that the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray is found, which is crucial for the problem.

- **Correctness of Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is correctly calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This is because the first operation can either add the maximum subarray sum `t` or an empty subarray sum (which is 0).

- **Correctness of Operations Loop:**
  - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` in each operation and adds it to `ans`. This is based on the observation that each operation can potentially double the maximum subarray sum.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values remain within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation to handle large numbers. The approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
