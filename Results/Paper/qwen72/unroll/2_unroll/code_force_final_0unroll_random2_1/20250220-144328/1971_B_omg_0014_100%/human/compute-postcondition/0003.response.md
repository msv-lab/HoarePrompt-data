The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function processes each test case and returns the results based on the input string `s`.
