Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest sorted version of `s` depending on the initial order of `s`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be redefined in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will depend on the last input string `s`. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` will remain unchanged.**
