Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the difficulty level 'G' in the string `s`. The string `p` only contains the characters 'ABCDEF', but the problem description specifies that the difficulty levels can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. Therefore, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of problems needed for rounds that require a 'G' difficulty level.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program that includes 'G' in the string `p`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input:
  ```
  3
  10 1
  BGECDCBDED
  10 2
  BGECDCBDED
  9 1
  BBCDEFFGG
  ```
  The output should be:
  ```
  2
  5
  1
  ```

- The first test case is correct because the string 'BGECDCBDED' lacks 'A' and 'F', so Vlad needs to come up with 2 problems.
- The second test case is correct because the string 'BGECDCBDED' lacks 'A', 'F', and 'G', and has only 1 'B' and 1 'D', so Vlad needs to come up with 5 problems.
- The third test case is correct because the string 'BBCDEFFGG' lacks 'A', so Vlad needs to come up with 1 problem.

By including 'G' in the string `p`, the program will correctly handle all difficulty levels and produce the correct output.
