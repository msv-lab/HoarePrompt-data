The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, and for each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `s` of `n` characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the number of characters from 'A' to 'F' that are either missing from the string `s` or appear fewer than `m` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the calculated values for `ans` have been printed for each test case.
