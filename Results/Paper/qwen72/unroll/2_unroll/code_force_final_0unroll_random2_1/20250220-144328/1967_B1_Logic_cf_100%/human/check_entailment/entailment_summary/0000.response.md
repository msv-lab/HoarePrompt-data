Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Value of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs should start from 0, and we need to count pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Loop for `b`**: The program iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. This is incorrect because the loop should iterate from 1 to `m` (inclusive) to consider all possible values of `b`.

4. **Condition Check**: The program uses the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to update `ans`. This is incorrect because it does not check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it adds a value that is not related to the problem's requirement.

5. **Correct Condition**: The correct condition to check is whether `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be implemented using the `math.gcd` function and a proper loop to count valid pairs.

6. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, but the value of `ans` is not correctly calculated.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
