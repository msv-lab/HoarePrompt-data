Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is a good starting point because for `b = 1`, the condition `a + b` is always a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` (since `gcd(a, 1) = 1` and `a + 1` is always a multiple of 1). Therefore, there are `n` valid pairs when `b = 1`.

3. **Loop for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`**: The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is because the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, and the loop correctly covers all possible values of `b` starting from 2.

4. **Condition Check and Calculation**: Inside the loop, the program updates `ans` with the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`. This expression is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `b`. However, this expression is incorrect. The correct condition to check is whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current expression does not correctly implement this condition.

5. **Output**: The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of valid pairs for that test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and handles multiple test cases.
- The initialization of `ans` to `n` is correct for the case when `b = 1`.
- The loop correctly iterates over the range of `b` values.
- However, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Expression:
The correct expression to count valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `b` should be:
```python
ans += sum(1 for a in range(1, n + 1) if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0)
```
However, this would be inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach would involve precomputing the gcd values or using a different mathematical insight to count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the expression used to count valid pairs is wrong.

Correctness: **False**
