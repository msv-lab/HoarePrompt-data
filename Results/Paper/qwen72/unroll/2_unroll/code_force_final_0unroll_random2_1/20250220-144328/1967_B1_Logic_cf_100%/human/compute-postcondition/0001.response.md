The only objects in the loop head are the variables `T` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. The variable `T` is the loop index, which starts at 0. The state of `n` and `m` are not relevant to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Given that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and it is now assigned the value of an input integer, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The initial state of `T` should be 0, as it is the starting index for the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0**
