Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and for each iteration, the variables `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided for that iteration. The variable `ans` will be calculated and printed for each iteration, and its value will be `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The final state of `n` and `m` will be the values provided in the last test case, and `ans` will be the last calculated value before the loop ends.**
