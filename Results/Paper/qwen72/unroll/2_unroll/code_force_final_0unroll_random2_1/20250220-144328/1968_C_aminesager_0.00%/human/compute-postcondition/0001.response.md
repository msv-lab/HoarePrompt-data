The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already within a range that ensures it is non-zero, no adjustment is needed.

State: **The function should accept a list of integers `x` where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, and n is the length of the array `a` which is at least 2 and does not exceed 500. `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
