The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.

Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 to 10^4, the function returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of bounds.
Case_2: If `n` is outside the range 1 to 10^5, or if `k` is not less than `n`, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` or `k` is out of bounds.
Case_3: If the adjacency list `adj` does not correctly represent a tree with `n` vertices, the function returns an error message indicating that the adjacency list is invalid.
Case_4: If the input parameters are valid, the function returns a result based on the tree structure and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. If `t` is out of bounds, it returns an error message. If `n` or `k` are out of bounds, it returns an error message. If the adjacency list `adj` is invalid, it returns an error message. If all inputs are valid, it returns a result based on the tree structure and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
