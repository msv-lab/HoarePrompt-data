To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `z` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `z` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment by 1 for each iteration. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `adj`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is assigned the value of an input integer read from `sys.stdin`.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5.
- `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with `n` vertices.

We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `z` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
