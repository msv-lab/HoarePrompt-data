### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).

4. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR:**
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \).
   - If the result is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, it prints the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \ge 2 \).

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Finding Maximum OR Value:**
  - The first loop ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation. This is because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and the loop compares each number with the current maximum.
- **Correctness of Finding Maximum XOR Value:**
  - The second loop ensures that \( prev \) is the index of the number that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result. This is because the bitwise OR of \( p_{v1} \) with any other number \( p_i \) will be greater than or equal to \( p_{v1} \), and the loop finds the \( p_i \) that maximizes the XOR with \( p_{v1} \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
