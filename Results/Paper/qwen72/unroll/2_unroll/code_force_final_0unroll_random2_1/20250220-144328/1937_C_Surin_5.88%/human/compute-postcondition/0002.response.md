The only objects in the loop head are `kp` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(input())`. If this result is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `kp` is not defined, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
