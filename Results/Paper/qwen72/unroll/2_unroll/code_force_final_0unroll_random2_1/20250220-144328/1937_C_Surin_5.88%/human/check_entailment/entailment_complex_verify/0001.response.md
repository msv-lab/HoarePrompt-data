### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).

   **Annotation Verification:**
   - The query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \) compares \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \).
   - Since \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} = p_{v1} \) and \( p_i \mid p_i = p_i \), the comparison is effectively between \( p_{v1} \) and \( p_i \).
   - This loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the maximum value in the permutation.

4. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR:**
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \).
   - If the result is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).

   **Annotation Verification:**
   - The query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \) compares \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \).
   - Since \( p_{v1} \) is the same in both comparisons, the comparison effectively reduces to comparing \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \).
   - However, this is not the correct approach to maximize \( p_i \oplus p_{v1} \). The bitwise OR operation does not directly help in finding the maximum XOR value.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, it prints the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer.

   **Annotation Verification:**
   - The output format is correct, but the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) may not necessarily maximize \( p_i \oplus p_{v1} \).

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \ge 2 \).

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Finding Maximum OR Value:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the maximum value in the permutation.

- **Correctness of Finding Maximum XOR Value:**
  - The second loop does not correctly identify the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized. The bitwise OR operation used in the queries does not help in finding the maximum XOR value. The correct approach would be to directly compare the XOR values, but the given program does not do this.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
