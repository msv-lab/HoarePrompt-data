### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).
   - **Correctness Analysis:** This loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the maximum value in the permutation. The query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \) effectively compares \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) because \( p_a \mid p_a = p_a \).

4. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR:**
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \).
   - If the result is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).
   - **Correctness Analysis:** This loop aims to find the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized. The query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \) effectively compares \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \). However, this approach is not guaranteed to find the maximum XOR. The bitwise OR operation does not directly help in maximizing the XOR. The XOR operation is more complex and depends on the bit patterns of the numbers, not just their magnitudes.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, it prints the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \ge 2 \).

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Finding Maximum OR Value:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the maximum value in the permutation. This is because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and the loop compares each number with the current maximum.
- **Correctness of Finding Maximum XOR Value:**
  - The second loop does not ensure that \( prev \) is the index of the number that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result. The bitwise OR operation used in the queries does not directly help in maximizing the XOR. The XOR operation is more complex and depends on the bit patterns of the numbers, not just their magnitudes.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The second loop's approach using bitwise OR is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
