Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum number of points you can get, given the optimal play from Nene. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` on your cards.

2. **Counting Cards**: It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand. This is necessary because each integer from 1 to `n` can appear at most twice.

3. **Calculating Points**: The program iterates through the `cnt` list and for each integer `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer `ans`. This is because:
   - If `x` appears 0 times in your hand, you get 0 points.
   - If `x` appears 1 time in your hand, you can't get a point from it because Nene will play the second card optimally.
   - If `x` appears 2 times in your hand, you can get 1 point from it by playing the first card and then the second card when the first card is already on the table.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated answer `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures that you maximize your points while considering Nene's optimal play. The program efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for the given examples.
