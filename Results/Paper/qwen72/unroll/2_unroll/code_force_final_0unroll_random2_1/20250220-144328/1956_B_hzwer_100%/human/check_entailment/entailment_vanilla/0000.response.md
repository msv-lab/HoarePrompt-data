### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The goal is to maximize your score, knowing that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If you have a card with an integer that appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with that card because Nene will not have the matching card to place on the table.
   - If you have a card with an integer that appears twice in your hand, you can score a point with the second card if Nene does not have the matching card or if she has already placed it on the table.

3. **Counting Strategy:**
   - The program uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - For each integer `x` in your hand, `cnt[x]` is incremented.
   - The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of integers that appear twice in your hand, because for each such integer, you can score a point with the second card.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.
   - It then calculates the total score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This effectively counts the number of integers that appear twice in your hand.
   - Finally, it prints the calculated score.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If an integer appears only once in your hand, `cnt[x]` will be 1, and `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0, which is correct.
   - If an integer appears twice in your hand, `cnt[x]` will be 2, and `max(0, x - 1)` will be 1, which is correct.
   - If an integer does not appear in your hand, `cnt[x]` will be 0, and `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0, which is correct.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the number of integers that appear twice in your hand.
   - Nene's optimal strategy is not explicitly coded, but it is implicitly handled by the fact that you can only score points for integers that appear twice in your hand, and Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
