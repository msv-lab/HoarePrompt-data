You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

    #State: The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` variable is the next line of input after all iterations of the loop have completed. The `cnt` list is reset to a list of zeros of length n + 1 after each iteration, and `ans` is calculated and printed for each iteration, but its final value is not retained between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the function calculates the number of integers in `a` that appear more than once and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that the input has been fully read, and the results for all test cases have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each card number in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each card number.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It iterates through the `cnt` list and for each card number `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`.
   - The expression `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that if you have only one card of a particular number, you get 0 points for it. If you have two cards of the same number, you get 1 point (since the second card will match the first one on the table).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - You can only score points if you have a pair of the same card number in your hand. The first card you play will not score a point, but the second card will if the first one is already on the table.
  - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the program only focuses on the maximum points you can score, which is correct because the number of points you can score is independent of Nene's strategy as long as you play optimally.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where you have only one card of a particular number (you get 0 points for it).
  - The program also handles the case where you have no pairs at all (you get 0 points).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the frequencies of the card numbers and calculates the maximum points in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally. It handles all the cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
