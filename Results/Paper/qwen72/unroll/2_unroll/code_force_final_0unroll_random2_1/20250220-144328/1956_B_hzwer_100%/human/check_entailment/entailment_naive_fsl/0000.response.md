Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy for Nene. The program simply counts how many cards in your hand have a duplicate in the deck, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points you can get when Nene plays optimally.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1`, as shown in the problem description. However, the program will output `2` because it counts the duplicates in your hand without considering Nene's optimal play.

In the optimal play, Nene would play her cards in a way that minimizes your score. The program does not account for this strategic play, leading to incorrect results.
