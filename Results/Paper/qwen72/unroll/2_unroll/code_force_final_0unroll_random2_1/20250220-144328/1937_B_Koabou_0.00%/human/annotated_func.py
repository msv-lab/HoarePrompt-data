#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 where a1[i] and a2[i] represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in a1 and a2 consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to n[i]. The sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two binary strings, each of which was read from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the two binary strings. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The variable `a1` remains unchanged. The variable `a2` remains unchanged. The list `s` will either contain the concatenated string formed by slicing `a[0]` up to the index where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', followed by the rest of `a[1]` starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The variable `x` will either be the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or if no such index is found, it will be `n - 1`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the two binary strings. The variable `t` will either be `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index that satisfies `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or if no such index is found, `t` will remain 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The variable `a1` remains unchanged. The variable `a2` remains unchanged. The list `s` will either contain the concatenated string formed by slicing `a[0]` up to the index where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', followed by the rest of `a[1]` starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The variable `x` will either be the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or if no such index is found, it will be `n - 1`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the concatenated string formed by slicing a[0] up to the index where a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', followed by the rest of a[1] starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either `x - i + 1` if an index `i` is found such that `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such index is found)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` from the input. It then searches for the first index `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. If such an index is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of `a[0]` up to that index with the suffix of `a[1]` starting from that index. If no such index is found, `s` is set to the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The function also calculates a value `t` which is either `x - i + 1` if an index `i` is found such that `a[0][:i + 1]` matches `s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such index is found. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any values.
