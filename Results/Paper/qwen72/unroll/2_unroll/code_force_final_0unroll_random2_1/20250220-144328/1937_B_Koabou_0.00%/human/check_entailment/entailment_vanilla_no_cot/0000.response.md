Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Path Calculation for Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if the next cell in the top row is '1' and the corresponding cell in the bottom row is '0'. If this condition is met, it switches to the bottom row.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that the path taken will yield the lexicographically smallest string. The program should always try to move right if possible and only switch to the bottom row if it is necessary to avoid a '1' in the top row.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program's logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is incorrect. The variable `t` is set in a way that does not accurately count the number of valid paths.
   - The correct approach would be to count the number of positions where the grasshopper can switch from the top row to the bottom row without increasing the lexicographical order of the string.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - Start from the top-left cell and move right as long as the top row has '0's.
   - If a '1' is encountered in the top row and the corresponding cell in the bottom row is '0', switch to the bottom row and continue moving right.
   - Continue this process until the bottom-right cell is reached.

2. **Count the Number of Paths:**
   - Count the number of positions where the grasshopper can switch from the top row to the bottom row without increasing the lexicographical order of the string.
   - This can be done by counting the number of '0's in the top row that are followed by a '0' in the bottom row.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    top_row = input()
    bottom_row = input()
    
    # Initialize the lexicographically smallest string
    smallest_string = top_row[0]
    path_count = 1
    
    # Determine the lexicographically smallest string and count the paths
    for i in range(1, n):
        if top_row[i] == '0':
            smallest_string += top_row[i]
        else:
            if bottom_row[i-1] == '0':
                smallest_string += bottom_row[i:]
                path_count = 1
                for j in range(i):
                    if top_row[j] == '0' and bottom_row[j] == '0':
                        path_count += 1
                break
            else:
                smallest_string += top_row[i]
    
    # Add the last character from the bottom row
    smallest_string += bottom_row[-1]
    
    print(smallest_string)
    print(path_count)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string.
