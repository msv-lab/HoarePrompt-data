### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Logic for Placing Icons:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
     - It then calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. So, `y * 4` cells are occupied by 2x2 icons, and `bxsfory * 15` cells are available on the screens. The remaining space for 1x1 icons is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - If the remaining space for 1x1 icons is non-positive, it means all 1x1 icons can fit on the screens already used for 2x2 icons. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is then the sum of the screens used for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The program correctly outputs 0, as no screens are needed.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of screens required for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
