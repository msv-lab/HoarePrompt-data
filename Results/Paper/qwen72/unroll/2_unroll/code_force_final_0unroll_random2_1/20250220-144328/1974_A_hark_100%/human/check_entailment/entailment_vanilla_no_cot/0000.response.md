Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required for the applications. Specifically, the issue lies in the line where the `x` value is updated:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

This line incorrectly subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the screens occupied by 2x2 icons and then adds the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons. This is not the correct way to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

The correct approach should be to first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons on the remaining space. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        remaining_1x1 = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons:**
   - Each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.
   - `screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculate the remaining cells on these screens after placing 2x2 icons:**
   - Each screen has 15 cells.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4` calculates the number of cells left after placing all 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed:**
   - `remaining_1x1 = max(0, x - remaining_cells)` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed after using the remaining cells on the screens with 2x2 icons.

4. **Calculate the total number of screens needed:**
   - `total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)` adds the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons to the number of screens already used for 2x2 icons.

This corrected program should now correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
