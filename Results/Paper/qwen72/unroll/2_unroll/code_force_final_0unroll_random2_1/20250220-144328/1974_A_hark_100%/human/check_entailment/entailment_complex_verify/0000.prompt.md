You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.

        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:

            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

    #State: The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided in each iteration of the loop. The variable `ap` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `ap` from the user, which determines the number of iterations. In each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99) from the user. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a value. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it performs a calculation involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `ap` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration but are not retained outside the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This line attempts to adjust the count of 1x1 icons by subtracting the number of 1x1 icons that could be placed in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, but it incorrectly adds `y * 4` to the result, which is not necessary.

A correct approach would be to calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_space = (5 * 3) * screens_for_2x2 - (y * 4)
        remaining_1x1 = max(0, x - remaining_space)
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)
```

However, the original program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`:

- The program calculates `bxsfory` as `1` (since `y = 1` and `1 / 2 = 0.5`, which is rounded up to `1`).
- It then calculates `x` as `15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 4`.
- This results in `bxsfory1` being `1` (since `4 / 15` is `0.2667`, which is rounded up to `1`).
- The total number of screens is `1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the correct answer should be `1` because the 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icon. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
