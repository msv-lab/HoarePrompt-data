The only object in the loop head is the `_` variable, which is used to iterate over the range determined by the user input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as the loop will not run if the input is 0 or negative. The state of `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the input must be a valid integer to ensure the loop can start.

State: **`_` is about to be assigned values from a range, the range is determined by an integer input that must be greater than 0**
