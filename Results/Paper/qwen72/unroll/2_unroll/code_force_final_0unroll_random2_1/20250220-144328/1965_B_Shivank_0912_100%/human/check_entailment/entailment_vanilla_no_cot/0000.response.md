Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct solution to the problem based on the following analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program determines the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by finding the highest bit set in `k`.
   - It then constructs a sequence `ans` that includes:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.
     - `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: These values are chosen to ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
     - All powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` (excluding `1 << i`), which are added to ensure that all other sums can be formed.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans` and then the elements of the sequence.

4. **Conditions**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - The sequence is also constructed to ensure that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by appropriate subsequences.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The sequence `ans` is of size at most 25, which satisfies the problem constraints.
   - The elements of the sequence are non-negative integers, which also satisfies the problem constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
