The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
