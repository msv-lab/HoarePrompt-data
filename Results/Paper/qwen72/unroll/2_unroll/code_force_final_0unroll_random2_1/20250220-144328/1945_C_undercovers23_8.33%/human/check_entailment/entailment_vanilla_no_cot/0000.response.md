Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program has a few logical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates the percentage of zeros and ones on each side of the road and checks if these percentages are at least 50%. However, the problem does not require percentage calculations; it requires ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. The percentage calculation is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the percentage of zeros on the left side and the percentage of ones on the right side are at least 50%. This is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be:
   - On the left side: at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) zeros.
   - On the right side: at least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) ones.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house (i = 0) or after the last house (i = n). These cases should be considered to ensure the solution is correct.

4. **Optimal Position Calculation**: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple positions satisfy the condition and need to be as close to the middle of the village as possible. It should find the position that minimizes \(\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|\) and, in case of a tie, choose the smaller position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero_count = 0
        one_count = s.count('1')
        
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i > 0 and s[i-1] == '0':
                zero_count += 1
            left_zeros_needed = math.ceil(i / 2)
            right_ones_needed = math.ceil((n - i) / 2)
            
            if zero_count >= left_zeros_needed and one_count - (i - zero_count) >= right_ones_needed:
                diff = abs(n // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff:
                    best_i = i
                    min_diff = diff
                elif diff == min_diff:
                    best_i = min(best_i, i)
        
        if best_i == -1:
            if one_count >= (n + 1) // 2:
                best_i = 0
            else:
                best_i = n
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Counts the number of zeros and ones up to the current position.
- Checks the correct condition for the number of zeros on the left side and ones on the right side.
- Finds the position that minimizes the distance to the middle of the village.
- Handles the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house or after the last house.
