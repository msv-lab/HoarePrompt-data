To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the loop condition:

- **State right before the while loop:**
  - `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
  - `w` is the square root of `q`.
  - If `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.
  - `i` is 1.

- **Loop condition:**
  - `while i < w:`

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < w` must be true. Given that `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `w` is the square root of `q`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < w`, which translates to `1 < w`.

3. **Adjusting `w`:**
   - `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q`, `q` must be greater than 1 for `w` to be greater than 1.

4. **Verification of `w` and `q`:**
   - Given the initial constraints \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `q` is already greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `w` (the square root of `q`) will also be greater than 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial state already ensures that `w` is greater than 1, so no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
Since the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, we can repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`. If `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.**
