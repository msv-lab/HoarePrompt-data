### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads and processes a line of input, converting it into a list of integers. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` handles the main logic for each test case.
   - It reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.
   - It reads the item prices for Alice (`a_i`) and the item bonuses for Bob (`b_i`).
   - It creates a list `combined` where each element is a tuple `(neg_price, bonus)`, where `neg_price` is `-a_i` and `bonus` is `b_i`. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap (which is implemented as a max-heap in Python using negative values).

3. **Heap and Remaining Items**:
   - The `combined` list is sorted by `bonus` in ascending order.
   - The first `k` items (with the smallest bonuses) are pushed into a min-heap `heap`. This ensures that Bob will take the items with the smallest bonuses for free.
   - The remaining items are stored in the `remaining_items` list.

4. **Calculating Initial Profit**:
   - The function `func_3` is called with `remaining_items` and `heap` to calculate the initial profit. This function sums the bonuses of the items in the heap and adds the values of `a_i + b_i` for the remaining items where `a_i + b_i` is non-negative.

5. **Optimizing Profit**:
   - The function iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit by considering the effect of adding each item to the heap and removing the least profitable item from the heap.
   - The profit is updated by subtracting the bonus of the item being added if `a_i + b_i` is non-negative, and adding the negative price if `a_i + b_i` is negative.
   - The profit is also updated by subtracting the negative price of the item being removed from the heap.
   - The maximum profit is tracked and updated during this process.

6. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_3` correctly calculates the initial profit by summing the bonuses of the items in the heap and adding the values of `a_i + b_i` for the remaining items where `a_i + b_i` is non-negative.
- The function `func_4` correctly handles the main logic of the problem by:
  - Sorting the items by their bonuses.
  - Using a min-heap to keep track of the `k` items with the smallest bonuses.
  - Iteratively updating the profit by considering the effect of adding and removing items from the heap.
  - Ensuring that Bob takes the least profitable items for free and Alice maximizes her profit.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
