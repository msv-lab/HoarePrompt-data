Output State: **`t` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to the integer conversion of the user input. Since no variables were passed to the function `func_2` initially, the only change is the assignment of `t`. The value of `t` is now an integer provided by the user.
