The function `func` reads an integer from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It then modifies a list `nums` by appending three new elements and removing one element. Specifically, it appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list, and removes the element `1 << idx`, where `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`. The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list. After each iteration, the length of `nums` is 23, and the variables `n` and `k` retain their values from the input for that iteration. The function does not return any value.
