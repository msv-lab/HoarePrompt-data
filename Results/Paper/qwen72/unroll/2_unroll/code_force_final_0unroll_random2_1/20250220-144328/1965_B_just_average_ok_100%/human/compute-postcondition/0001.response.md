Output State: **The loop modifies the `nums` list by appending three new elements and removing one element in each iteration. The length of the `nums` list after each iteration will be 23, and the elements of the `nums` list will be the original list with the new elements added and the removed element taken out. The variables `n` and `k` will retain their values from the input for each iteration, but their final values will be the last values read from the input.**

To break it down:
- `n` and `k` will be the last integers read from the input.
- `nums` will be a list of 23 elements, where the element `1 << idx` (where `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`) is removed, and three new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added.
