### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence whose sum is `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum is `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
   - The program starts by constructing a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because any integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

3. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program then finds the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by iterating through the sequence and stopping when `nums[i]` exceeds `k`.
   - The value of `idx` is set to `i - 1` to ensure `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - The program appends three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence, as `k` is now split into two parts, one of which is not a power of 2.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed, which is also necessary for the range `1` to `n`.
   - The program then removes `1 << idx` from the sequence to prevent the formation of the sum `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified sequence.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1 (No subsequence with sum `k`)**:
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. This is because `k` is now split into two parts, and the removed element was necessary to form `k` using the powers of 2.
  - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` does not affect the inability to form the sum `k` because these elements are not part of the original sequence that would form `k`.

- **Condition 2 (All other sums `v` in the range `1` to `n` can be formed)**:
  - The sequence `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\).
  - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that the sums `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
  - The removal of `1 << idx` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` do not affect the ability to form other sums in the range `1` to `n` because the remaining elements can still form any sum up to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums in the range `1` to `n` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
