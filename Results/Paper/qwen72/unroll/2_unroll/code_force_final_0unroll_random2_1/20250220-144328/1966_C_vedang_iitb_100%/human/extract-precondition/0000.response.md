Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists stones where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. Each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the piles of stones for a test case.
