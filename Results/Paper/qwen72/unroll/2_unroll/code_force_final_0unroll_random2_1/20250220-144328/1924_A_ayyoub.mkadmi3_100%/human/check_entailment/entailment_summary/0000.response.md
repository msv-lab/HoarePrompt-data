Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, it should provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in `s`:
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains more than one character, `i` is removed from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains only one character, `i` is added to `s2`, and the `alphabet` set is reset to contain all `k` characters.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple with three elements:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program checks the boolean value returned by `func_1`.
   - If the boolean is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence by appending the missing character to `s2`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Boolean Check:**
  - The boolean check `len(s1) >= n * k` is used to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
  - This check is incorrect because the length of `s1` being at least `n * k` does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences. For example, if `s1` is "aaaa" and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the length of `s1` is 4, but "bb" is not a subsequence of "aaaa".

- **Subsequence Construction:**
  - The program constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence by appending the missing character to `s2`. This approach is not always correct because it assumes that the missing character is the only one that can form a non-subsequence string, which is not always the case.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` is flawed. The boolean check `len(s1) >= n * k` is insufficient, and the construction of the non-subsequence string is not robust.

Correctness: **False**
