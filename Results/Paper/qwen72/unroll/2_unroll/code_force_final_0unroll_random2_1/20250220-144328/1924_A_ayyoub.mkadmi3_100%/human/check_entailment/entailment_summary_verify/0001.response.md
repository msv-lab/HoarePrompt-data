### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence.
   - If not, it constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence and appends it to the output list `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `s`, the integer `k`, and the integer `n` as input.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` contains more than one character, the character is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` contains only one character, the character is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

4. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. This is incorrect because the length of `s1` being at least `n * k` does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences.
   - The correct approach would be to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - If the function returns `False`, the program attempts to construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - It finds the first character in the range `[a, k]` that is not in `s1` and repeats it `n - len(s2)` times.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid example of a missing subsequence. For example, if `s1` contains all characters but in a specific order, the constructed string might still be a subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`. The logic for checking the length of `s1` and constructing the missing subsequence is flawed.

**Final: False**
