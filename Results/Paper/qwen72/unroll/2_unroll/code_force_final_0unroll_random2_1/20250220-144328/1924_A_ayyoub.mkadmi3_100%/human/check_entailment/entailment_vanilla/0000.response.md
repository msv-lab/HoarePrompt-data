### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` is empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - `len(s1) >= n * k`: This checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is the minimum length required to form all possible strings of length `n` using `k` alphabets.
     - `s1[r * k:]`: This is the remaining part of `s1` after the first `r * k` characters.
     - `s2`: This is the string formed by the characters that were added to `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1` and gets the tuple `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as a subsequence in `s`.
     - It then finds the first character in the range of the first `k` alphabets that is not in `s1`.
     - It constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using this character.
     - It appends `s2 + be9i` to the output list `OUT`.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends `Yes` to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints each element in the `OUT` list, which contains the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Subsequence Check:**
  - The function `func_1` attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be formed as a subsequence in `s`.
  - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly check if all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it only checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure all combinations are subsequences.

- **Counterexample:**
  - Consider the test case `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = "abab"`.
  - The function `func_1` will return `True` because `s1` will be `"abab"`, and `len(s1) >= n * k` is `True`.
  - However, the string `"ba"` is not a subsequence of `s`, so the program should return `No` and print `"ba"`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. It only checks a condition that is not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: False**
