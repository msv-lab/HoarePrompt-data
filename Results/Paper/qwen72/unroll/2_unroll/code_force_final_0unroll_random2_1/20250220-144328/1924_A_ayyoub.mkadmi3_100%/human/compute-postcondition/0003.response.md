The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This ensures that `s` is not empty, so the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first character in `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in `s`**
