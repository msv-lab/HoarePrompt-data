The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 <= a_i <= 99.

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, I can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some value based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^3), `n` (an integer between 2 and 50), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and 99). The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
