### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads each constraint, storing them in appropriate lists based on their type.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program correctly identifies and stores constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x) in the `big` list.
   - It correctly identifies and stores constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x) in the `less` list.
   - It correctly identifies and stores constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x) in the `no` list.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the range of valid integers `k` by finding the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list.
   - The formula `min(less) - max(big) + 1` is used to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy the range constraints. This is correct because it gives the count of integers from `max(big)` to `min(less)` inclusive.

4. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program then iterates over the `no` list to exclude any specific values that `k` cannot be.
   - It checks if each value in `no` falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` and decrements `num` if it does. This is correct because it ensures that the final count does not include these specific values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count of valid integers `k` for each test case.
   - If the calculated range is invalid (i.e., `num < 1`), it correctly prints `0`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the constraints and edge cases correctly. It correctly calculates the range of valid integers `k` and excludes any specific values that are not allowed. The logic and flow of the program align with the problem description and the provided example.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
