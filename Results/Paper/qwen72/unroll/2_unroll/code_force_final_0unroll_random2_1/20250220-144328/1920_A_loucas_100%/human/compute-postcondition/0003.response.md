The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should be called with input data that includes the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves, which are pairs `(a, x)`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9.
- It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

The function processes these constraints for each test case and returns the result based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a set of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). It returns the result of processing these constraints for each test case.**
