### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`) and then reads each constraint, storing them in appropriate lists (`big`, `less`, `no`).

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The function correctly identifies and processes the constraints:
     - `big` stores the values for which `k` must be greater than or equal to.
     - `less` stores the values for which `k` must be less than or equal to.
     - `no` stores the values for which `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the range of possible values for `k` using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This is correct because:
     - `min(less)` gives the smallest upper bound.
     - `max(big)` gives the largest lower bound.
     - The range of valid `k` values is from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, inclusive.

4. **Exclusion of Invalid Values**:
   - The function then iterates over the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the calculated range. This is necessary because the constraints of type 3 specify values that `k` must not take.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
   - If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0, which is correct because it means no valid `k` values exist.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It follows the problem description and handles all edge cases, such as when the range is invalid or when there are values to exclude.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
