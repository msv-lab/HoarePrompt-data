Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all \( n \) constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraint Collection**: For each test case, it collects the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (\( k \geq x \)), `less` for constraints of type 2 (\( k \leq x \)), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (\( k \neq x \)).
3. **Range Calculation**: It calculates the range of valid \( k \) values by finding the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list. The number of valid \( k \) values is then calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**: It iterates through the `no` list and excludes any values that fall within the valid range.
5. **Output**: It prints the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
- When the range is empty (i.e., `min(less) < max(big)`), it prints 0.
- When there are multiple constraints of the same type, it correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values.
- When there are forbidden values within the valid range, it correctly subtracts them from the count.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases.
