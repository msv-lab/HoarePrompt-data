You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `index` is `2 * t + 1`. `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `num_up_coins % 2 == 1` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` remains `2 * t + 1`, and the loop prints each string in the `results` list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `num_up_coins % 2 == 1` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It initializes `index` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, so the program appends `'YES'` to the `results` list.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win, so the program appends `'NO'` to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move available when it's his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (`num_up_coins == 0`), which results in a loss for the player whose turn it is.
  - The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one coin left, as no coins will be flipped in this scenario.

- **Input and Output**:
  - The program reads the input in the correct format and processes multiple test cases as specified.
  - The output is correctly formatted, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output as required and covers all edge cases.
