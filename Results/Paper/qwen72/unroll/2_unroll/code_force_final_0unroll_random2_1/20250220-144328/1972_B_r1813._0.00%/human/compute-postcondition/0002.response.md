Output State: **The function is now set up to read input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are still as described in the initial state, and no other variables have been affected. `data` is a list of strings, where each string is an element from the input split by whitespace. `index` is 0.**
