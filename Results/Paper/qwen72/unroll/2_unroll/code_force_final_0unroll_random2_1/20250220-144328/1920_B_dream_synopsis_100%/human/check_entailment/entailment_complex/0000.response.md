### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order and then reversed to be in descending order. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the array, which is useful for Alice's strategy to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum `sum1` of the array is calculated correctly.

4. **Dynamic Sum Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove, from 0 to `k`.
   - For each iteration:
     - If `i` is 0, it calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from `sum1`.
     - For other values of `i`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of Alice removing `i` elements and Bob multiplying the next `x` elements by -1. The update is done by adding the `i-1`th element and subtracting twice the `i+x-1`th element from the previous sum.
     - If `i + x - 1` is out of bounds, it simply adds the `i-1`th element to the previous sum.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Alice's Strategy**:
  - Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. By sorting and reversing the array, the smallest elements are at the end, and the largest elements are at the beginning.
  - The function correctly considers the sum after removing `i` elements for all `i` from 0 to `k`.

- **Bob's Strategy**:
  - Bob will multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The function correctly considers the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1 for each possible number of elements Alice removes.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` are 0 or when `n` is very small.
  - The logic for updating the sum when `i + x - 1` is out of bounds is correct.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it sorts the array once and then performs a linear scan for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum after Alice and Bob play their moves. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.
