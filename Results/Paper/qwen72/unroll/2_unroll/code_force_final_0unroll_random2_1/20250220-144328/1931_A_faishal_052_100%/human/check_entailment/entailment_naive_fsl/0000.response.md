Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
55
```

**Expected Output:**
```
czz
```

**Actual Output:**
```
azz
```

The program incorrectly assigns the first two letters as 'a' and 'z' instead of 'c' and 'z'. The correct approach should be to maximize the value of the last letter while ensuring the first two letters are as small as possible. The program fails to do this correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
