Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from the input. This is correct as per the problem statement, which specifies that the input is a single line containing a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program maintains a variable `balance` to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string. For each character:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   This correctly computes the balance of the prefix ending at each character.

3. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, negative position, and character in a list `details`. The negative position is used to ensure that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position. This is correct because the problem statement requires sorting by balance and then by position in decreasing order.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and negative position. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, with ties broken in decreasing order of position.

5. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together. This correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
