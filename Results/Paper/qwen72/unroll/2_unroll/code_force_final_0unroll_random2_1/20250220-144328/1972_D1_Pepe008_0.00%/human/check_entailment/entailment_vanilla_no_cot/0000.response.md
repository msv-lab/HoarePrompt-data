Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Loop Initialization for `j`:**
   - The loop for `j` starts from 4 instead of 1. This means the program will miss many valid pairs where `b` is less than 4.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct. This formula does not accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum `suma` is adjusted by subtracting 1, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Commented Out Code:**
   - The commented out code is not being used, and it contains a loop that starts `j` from 4, which is incorrect as mentioned above.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this approach might be too slow for large inputs due to the nested loops. A more efficient approach would involve mathematical insights to reduce the number of iterations.
