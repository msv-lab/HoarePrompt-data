### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) and assigns them to variables \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The program uses a single loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - The loop for \(a\) is not explicitly present, but the logic inside the loop is supposed to count valid pairs.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the given code.
   - Instead, the program uses a formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) to calculate the number of valid pairs, which is not derived from the problem statement.

5. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of valid pairs using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - This formula is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.

6. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach should involve two nested loops:
     - One loop for \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
     - One loop for \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment the count of valid pairs.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the program should find pairs like \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\).
   - The current logic in the program does not correctly identify these pairs and instead uses an incorrect formula.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and the logic used to count valid pairs is flawed. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not align with the problem statement and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Final: **False**
