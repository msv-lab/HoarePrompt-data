### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Code Analysis:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The code then attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a nested loop, but this part is commented out.
   - Instead, it uses a different approach to calculate the number of valid pairs.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
     \]
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot k\) and \(b = d \cdot l\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\).
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     d \cdot k + d \cdot l \equiv 0 \pmod{d \cdot l}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     k + l \equiv 0 \pmod{l}
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     k \equiv -l \pmod{l}
     \]
   - Since \(k\) and \(l\) are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(k, l) = 1\)), \(k\) must be a multiple of \(l\). However, \(k\) and \(l\) being coprime means \(k\) can only be 1. Therefore, \(a = d\) and \(b = d \cdot l\).

4. **Optimized Calculation:**
   - For each \(b\), we need to find the number of valid \(a\) such that \(a = d\) and \(d\) is a divisor of \(b\).
   - The number of valid \(a\) for a given \(b\) is the number of divisors of \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(a\).
   - The code calculates this by iterating over \(b\) and finding the number of valid \(a\) using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - b \cdot (b - 1)}{b^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a = d\) and \(d\) being a divisor of \(b\).

5. **Code Implementation:**
   - The code iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) using the formula and adds it to the sum.
   - The final result is printed after subtracting 1 (which is not clear why it is subtracted).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The formula used in the code is not immediately clear and may not correctly capture the number of valid pairs.
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end is not justified based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used is not derived from the problem's constraints, and the subtraction of 1 at the end is not explained.

**Correctness: False**
