### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The program uses a single loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - The loop for \(b\) starts from 1, which is correct based on the problem statement.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program does not use a nested loop to check all pairs \((a, b)\) as it should. Instead, it uses a formula to calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - The formula used is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), which is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).

5. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of valid pairs using the formula and prints `suma - 1`.
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this formula is not correct for the given problem.

6. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.
   - The loop for \(b\) should start from 1 and go up to \(m\).
   - The loop for \(a\) should start from 1 and go up to \(n\).

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the program should find pairs like \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\).
   - The program's current logic does not correctly identify these pairs. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and the logic used to count valid pairs is flawed. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not accurately reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
