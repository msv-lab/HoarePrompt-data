Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ticket prices and then iteratively selecting the minimum number of tickets to buy each day, based on the constraints of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) and the total number of tickets needed (`k`). However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should be initialized to 0, as it is supposed to accumulate the total cost of purchasing the tickets.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The program should add the cost of purchasing `s` tickets at the price `l[i]` to the total cost `c`. The current formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is not correct. The term `s * s / 2` seems to be an unnecessary adjustment and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic is mostly correct in that it sorts the prices and tries to buy the minimum number of tickets each day, but the cost calculation needs to be fixed.

4. **Final Output**: The final output should be the total cost `c`, but the program incorrectly adds an initial value `k * k / 2` to `c` before the loop, which is not part of the correct solution.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        
        print(c)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: `c` is initialized to 0 to correctly accumulate the total cost.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices. For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`s`) as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets needed). It then subtracts `s` from `k` and adds the cost of `s` tickets at the price `l[i]` to `c`.
- **Output**: After the loop, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
