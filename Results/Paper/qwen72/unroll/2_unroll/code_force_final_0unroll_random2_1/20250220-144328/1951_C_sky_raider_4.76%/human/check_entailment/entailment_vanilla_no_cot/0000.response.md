Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid initial value for the total cost. The total cost should start at 0 and be incremented by the cost of tickets purchased each day.

2. **Incorrect Logic in the Loop**: The loop logic is flawed. The program should keep track of the number of tickets purchased and the total cost, but the current logic incorrectly updates `c` and does not properly handle the ticket price increases.

3. **Incorrect Use of `min` Function**: The `min(m, k)` function is used to determine the number of tickets to buy each day, but the program does not correctly update the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += prices[day] * tickets_to_buy
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            for i in range(day + 1, n):
                prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `total_cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total tickets purchased.
   - `day` is initialized to 0 to iterate through the days.

2. **Loop to Purchase Tickets**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - `tickets_to_buy` is set to the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost for the current day is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented.
   - The prices for subsequent days are increased by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
   - The day counter is incremented.

3. **Output**:
   - The total cost is printed for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly compute the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets.
