Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly checks if the given array `b` can form a progressive square based on the rules provided. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the array `b` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the array `b`. This is the correct approach because the minimum element in the array should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This correctly follows the rules for constructing the progressive square.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input array can form the progressive square, and the program returns "yes". Otherwise, it returns "no".

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the function `func_1` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output for multiple test cases.

The program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form the specified progressive square. Therefore, the program is correct.
