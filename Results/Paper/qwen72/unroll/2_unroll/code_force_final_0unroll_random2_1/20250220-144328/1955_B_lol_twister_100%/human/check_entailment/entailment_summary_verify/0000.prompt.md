You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2 3
    
    3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
    
    3 2 3
    
    3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8
    
    2 100 100
    
    400 300 400 500
    
    3 2 3
    
    3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8
    
    4 4 4
    
    15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Output

    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The function generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` integers, where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k < n and 0 <= h < n, with `a` being the smallest integer in `l`. It then sorts both `l` and `li`. If the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in the array `b` are not unique. According to the problem description, the elements of the progressive square should be unique, but the program does not check for this. If there are duplicate elements in the array `b`, the program will still consider it as a valid progressive square, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8 8
```
The array `b` contains a duplicate element `8`. The program will still sort the list and compare it to the generated list of elements, which will result in an incorrect "yes" output, even though the elements are not unique and thus cannot form a valid progressive square.
