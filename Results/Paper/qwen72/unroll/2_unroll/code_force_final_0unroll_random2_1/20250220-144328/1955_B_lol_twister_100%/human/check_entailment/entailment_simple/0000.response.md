### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the list `l` of `n^2` integers.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program constructs a new list `li` by generating the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `0 <= k < n` and `0 <= h < n`.
   - This is correct because it follows the rules of constructing the progressive square as described in the problem statement.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the original list `l` and the constructed list `li` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the elements in `l` can form the progressive square.
   - If they are not equal, it returns 'no', indicating that the elements in `l` cannot form the progressive square.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `2 <= n <= 500`, `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`, and `1 <= b_i <= 10^9`.
   - The program also ensures that the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `25 * 10^4`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly follows the problem statement and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. The logic for constructing the progressive square and comparing it with the given list is sound and will produce the correct output for valid inputs.
