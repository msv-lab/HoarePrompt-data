Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k < n and 0 <= h < n.**
