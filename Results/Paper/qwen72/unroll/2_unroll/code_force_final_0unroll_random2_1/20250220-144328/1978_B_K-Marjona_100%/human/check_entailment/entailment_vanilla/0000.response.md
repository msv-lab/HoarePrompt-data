### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Determine the Optimal `k`:**
   - The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a key part of the solution.
   - The idea is to maximize the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The condition `k = min(n, b - a)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference `b - a`. This is because if `k` were greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would start becoming less than the usual price `a`, which would not be optimal.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as follows:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is the sum of the series from `b` to `b - k + 1`, which can be computed as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a` and when `n` is very large.
   - The use of `min(n, b - a)` ensures that the program does not attempt to sell more buns at the modified price than are available or beneficial.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, considering the modified and usual prices. The reasoning and calculations are sound, and the program handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
