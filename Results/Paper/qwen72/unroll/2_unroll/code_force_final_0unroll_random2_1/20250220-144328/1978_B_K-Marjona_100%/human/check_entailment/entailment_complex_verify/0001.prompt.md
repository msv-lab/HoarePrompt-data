You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b are unchanged. The loop prints the result of the calculation for each test case, which is either `a * n` if `b <= a`, or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` where `k = min(n, b - a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k = min(n, b - a)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Determine the Optimal `k`:**
   - The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a key part of the solution.
   - The idea is to maximize the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The condition `k = min(n, b - a)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference `b - a`. This is because if `k` were greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would start becoming less than the usual price `a`, which would not be optimal.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as follows:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is the sum of the series from `b` to `b - k + 1`, which can be computed as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a` and when `n` is very large.
   - The use of `min(n, b - a)` ensures that the program does not attempt to sell more buns at the modified price than are available or beneficial.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, considering the modified and usual prices. The reasoning and calculations are sound, and the program handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
