Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it processes the prefix sums and calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could lead to the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Issues:

1. **DP Initialization and Transition:**
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, which means the prefix sum starts at 0. However, the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and does not necessarily start at 0.
   - The transition in the DP array is incorrect. The program assumes that each element in the prefix sum array `p` can be reached by adding or subtracting 1 from the previous prefix sum, but this is not always the case. The prefix sum array `p` is sorted, and the elements in `p` must be reachable by a sequence of 1s and -1s that maintains the sorted order.

2. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum is calculated as `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`. This is incorrect because the final sum should be the last element of the prefix sum array `p` plus the offset, but the offset is not correctly used to map the prefix sum to the DP array.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Check the Validity of the Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Ensure that the difference between consecutive elements in the prefix sum array `p` is either 0 or 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it is impossible to construct the array `a` with only 1s and -1s.

2. **Count the Number of Ways:**
   - Use a combinatorial approach to count the number of ways to construct the array `a` such that the prefix sums, when sorted, match the given array `p`. This involves counting the number of 1s and -1s that can be placed to achieve the given prefix sums.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def count_ways(n, p):
    # Check if the prefix sum array is valid
    for i in range(1, n):
        if p[i] - p[i - 1] > 1:
            return 0
    
    # Initialize the DP array
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    
    # The final prefix sum should be p[-1] + offset
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = count_ways(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Validation:**
   - The function `count_ways` first checks if the prefix sum array `p` is valid by ensuring that the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1.

2. **DP Array:**
   - The DP array `dp` is used to count the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum. The offset is used to handle negative prefix sums.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each element in the prefix sum array `p`, the DP array is updated to reflect the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum by adding or subtracting 1.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The final result is the value in the DP array corresponding to the last element of the prefix sum array `p` plus the offset.

This approach ensures that the program correctly counts the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
