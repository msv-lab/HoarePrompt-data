Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum array `p` is not possible to be generated from an array `a` consisting only of 1 and -1. For example, consider the input where `n = 3` and `p = [-1, 0, 2]`. This prefix sum array is not possible because the maximum prefix sum that can be achieved with an array of 1s and -1s of length 3 is 3, and the minimum is -3. The array `p = [-1, 0, 2]` would imply that the sum of the array `a` can jump from 0 to 2, which is not possible with only 1s and -1s. However, the function `func_1` does not check for this condition and will return a result, which is incorrect.
