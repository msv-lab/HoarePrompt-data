Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input until EOF, `index` is 1, `t` is now equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.**
