You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a series of inputs from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5000) and a sorted list `p` of `n` integers (each between -n and n). It then calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by reading from standard input and printing the results to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of an unknown array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - n` using the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - The offset `n` is used to handle negative indices in the DP array.
   - The DP array is updated for each element in `a` by considering the two possible values (1 and -1) that can be added to the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, the function returns the value of `dp` at the index corresponding to the final sum of the prefix array `p`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)` initializes the DP array with zeros.
     - `offset = n` is used to handle negative indices.
     - `dp[offset] = 1` sets the initial state where the prefix sum is 0.
   - **DP Update:**
     - For each element in `a` (from 1 to `n`), a new DP array `new_dp` is created.
     - For each possible prefix sum `j`, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there are `dp[j]` ways to reach this prefix sum.
     - The new DP array `new_dp` is updated by adding the values from `dp` at `j + 1` and `j - 1` (mod MOD).
   - **Final Result:**
     - The final sum of the prefix array `p` is `p[-1]`.
     - The result is `dp[final_sum + offset]` which gives the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The function reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
     - It processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `p` from the list `data`.
   - **Calling `func_1`:**
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the result.
   - **Output:**
     - The results are stored in a list `results` and printed one by one.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge cases where `n = 1` and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]` correctly.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the prefix sum array `p` is impossible to achieve (e.g., `[-1, 1, 2]`).

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result does not exceed 998,244,353.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` and handles the input and output as specified.

### Correctness:
**True**
