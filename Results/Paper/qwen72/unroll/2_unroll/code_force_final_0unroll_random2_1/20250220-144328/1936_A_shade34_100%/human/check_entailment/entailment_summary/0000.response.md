Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Query Loop**:
   - The function initializes `mak` to 0, which is the first index.
   - It then iterates through the indices from 1 to n-1, comparing the bitwise OR of `(mak, mak)` with `(i, i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This loop helps in finding the index with the maximum value in the permutation, as `p_i | p_i` is simply `p_i`.

2. **Second Query Loop**:
   - The function initializes `mak2` to the value of `mak` found in the first loop.
   - It then iterates through all indices from 0 to n-1, comparing the bitwise OR of `(mak, mak2)` with `(i, mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`. This loop helps in finding indices that are potential candidates for the maximum XOR with `mak2`.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR**:
   - The function initializes `mak` to 0 again, but this time it is used to index into `pans`.
   - It iterates through the `pans` list, comparing the bitwise OR of `(pans[mak], pans[mak])` with `(pans[i], pans[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This loop helps in finding the index in `pans` that maximizes the XOR with `mak2`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The function prints the pair `(mak2, pans[mak])` as the indices that maximize the XOR.
   - It flushes the output after each query and the final answer to ensure the interactor receives the results correctly.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
   - The second loop makes `n` queries.
   - The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
   - The total number of queries is `2n-1 + (n-1) = 3n-2`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases as specified by the input `t`.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and logic. It efficiently uses the allowed number of queries to find the indices that maximize the XOR.

Correctness: **True**
