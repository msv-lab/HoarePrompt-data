Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the function has determined a pair of indices (mak2, pans[mak]) such that the bitwise XOR of `p[mak2]` and `p[pans[mak]]` is maximized, and has printed this pair. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are reset for each test case, and the loop iterates over all provided test cases.**
