You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is designed to interact with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. Each query involves selecting four indices (a, b, c, d) within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a comparison result between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the function has determined a pair of indices (mak2, pans[mak]) such that the bitwise XOR of `p[mak2]` and `p[pans[mak]]` is maximized, and has printed this pair. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are reset for each test case, and the loop iterates over all provided test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function interacts with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is a non-negative integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this, and it must handle multiple test cases with the total sum of n not exceeding 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
