Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is designed to interact with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. Each query involves selecting four indices (a, b, c, d) within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a comparison result between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
