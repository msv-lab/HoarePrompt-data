The function `func` interacts with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is a non-negative integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it determines a pair of indices (mak2, pans[mak]) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The function prints this pair for each test case and handles multiple test cases, with the total sum of n not exceeding 10^4. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that the pairs of indices have been printed for each test case.
