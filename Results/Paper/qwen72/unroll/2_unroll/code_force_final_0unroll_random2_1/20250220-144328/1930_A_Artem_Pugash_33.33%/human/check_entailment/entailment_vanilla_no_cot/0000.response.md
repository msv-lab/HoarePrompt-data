Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect due to the following issues:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program reads the input as a list of strings and then sorts it. However, sorting a list of strings lexicographically is different from sorting a list of integers. For example, the string `"10"` will be considered smaller than the string `"2"`. This can lead to incorrect results when the numbers are large.

2. **Converting to Integers**: The program should convert the input to integers before sorting, not during the while loop.

3. **Efficiency**: The program uses a while loop to repeatedly pop elements from the list, which is inefficient. Popping from the beginning of a list in Python is an O(n) operation, making the overall complexity O(n^2) for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        for j in range(numInteger):
            a = numbers[2 * j]
            b = numbers[2 * j + 1]
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading and Converting Input**: The input is read and immediately converted to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Calculating the Score**: The program iterates through the sorted list in pairs, adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first, maximizing the score.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
