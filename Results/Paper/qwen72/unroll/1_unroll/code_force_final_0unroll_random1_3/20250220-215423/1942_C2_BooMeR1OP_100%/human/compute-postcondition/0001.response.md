The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` before the loop starts is that it is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)**
