Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the gap between two chosen vertices is exactly 2. In such a case, adding a vertex between these two would not form a new triangle but would instead form a quadrilateral. This is a critical edge case that the program fails to account for, leading to an incorrect count of triangular pieces.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 1
1 3
```
Here, the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3. The gap between these vertices is 2 (vertices 2 and 4). If you choose vertex 2, the resulting shape is a quadrilateral (1-2-3-4), not a triangle. The program, however, would incorrectly count this as a triangle, leading to an incorrect output.
