Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the cost to move to a position `j` is less than the cost to move to a position `k` where `j < k < i`. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal way to move Kirill to the desired position by potentially skipping over positions that are more expensive to move through.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program will output `17`.

Here's why:
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- To move to position 3, he pays `b_3 = 8`.
- To move to position 2, he pays `a_2 = 3`.

The total cost is `8 + 3 = 11`.

However, the optimal solution is:
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- To move to position 2, he pays `a_2 = 3`.
- To move to position 1, he pays `b_1 = 4`.

The total cost is `3 + 4 = 7`, and then he can move to position 2, which is within the allowed range, with a total cost of `7 + 7 = 14`.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
