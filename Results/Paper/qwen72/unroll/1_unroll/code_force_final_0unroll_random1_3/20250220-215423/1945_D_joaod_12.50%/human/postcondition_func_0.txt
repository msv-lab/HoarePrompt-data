The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It then calculates the minimum cost to move from `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the costs provided in the lists. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. The function does not return any value. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not modified, and the lists `a` and `b` are not used within the function.
