### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook in a mirrored position.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to precompute the number of valid configurations for a given \( n \).
   - `dp[1]` is initialized to 1 because there is only one way to place a single rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
   - `dp[2]` is initialized to 3 because there are three ways to place two rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board:
     - (1, 2) and (2, 1)
     - (1, 1) and (2, 2)
     - (2, 1) and (1, 2)
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used. This relation accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column, which leaves \( i-1 \) rows and columns to be filled (hence `dp[i - 1]`).
     - Placing a rook in the \( i \)-th row and any of the \( i-1 \) columns, and then placing a rook in the corresponding mirrored position, which leaves \( i-2 \) rows and columns to be filled (hence `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then the \( k \) moves.
   - It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - After reading the \( k \) moves, the program calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are not occupied.
   - It then prints the precomputed value `dp[n - len(invalid)]` for the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) positions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0 by printing 1 (since there are no more moves to make, the configuration is already fixed).
   - The precomputation of `dp` values up to 300,000 ensures that the program can handle the maximum possible \( n \) efficiently.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly uses modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Annotations and Evaluation:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard.
  - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case without additional parameters for multiple test cases or the moves made.
  - This is correct as the function precomputes the DP values for all possible board sizes up to 300,000.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - `dp[1]` is initialized to 1, which is correct.
  - `dp[2]` is initialized to 3, which is correct.
  - The loop from 3 to \( n \) correctly updates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
  - The state after the loop is also correctly described.

- **Input Handling**:
  - Reading the number of test cases \( t \) and the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case is correct.
  - Using a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks is correct.

- **Final Configuration Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are not occupied by subtracting the length of the `invalid` set from \( n \).
  - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that if there are no more valid moves, the program prints 1, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution for the problem. It precomputes the number of valid configurations for all possible board sizes and uses this precomputed data to quickly determine the number of configurations for each test case. The logic for handling the input and the invalid positions is also correct.

Final: **True**
