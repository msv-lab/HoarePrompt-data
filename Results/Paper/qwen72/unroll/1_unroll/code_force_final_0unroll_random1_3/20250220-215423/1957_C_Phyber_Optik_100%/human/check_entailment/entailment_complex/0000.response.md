Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, given that \( k \) moves have already been made. The key points to consider are:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization and Calculation**:
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices.
   - The function `func_1` is called with a large value (300000) to precompute the DP values up to that index.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1 because there is only one way to place a rook on a \(1 \times 1\) board.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3 because there are three ways to place rooks on a \(2 \times 2\) board without attacking each other:
     - (1,1) and (2,2)
     - (1,2) and (2,1)
     - (1,2) and (2,2) (or vice versa, but they are considered the same configuration)
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of configurations for larger boards using the formula \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The program calculates the number of valid positions left by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It prints the result of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the precomputed number of configurations for the remaining valid positions.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n - len(invalid)` is 0 or 1.
   - The precomputation of `dp` values up to 300000 ensures that the program can handle the maximum possible value of `n` as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Mirroring Moves**:
   - The program correctly accounts for the computer's mirroring moves by adding both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set.
   - If `r = c`, the computer skips its turn, which is implicitly handled by the set addition (since adding the same value twice does not change the set).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
