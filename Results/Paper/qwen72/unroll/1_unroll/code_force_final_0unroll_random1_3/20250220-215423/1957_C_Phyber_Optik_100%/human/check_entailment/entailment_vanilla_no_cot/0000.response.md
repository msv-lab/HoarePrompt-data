Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the given problem. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for a given number of free rows and columns, and then for each test case, it calculates the number of remaining free rows and columns after the initial moves and uses the precomputed values to determine the number of possible final configurations.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices up to `300006`.
   - `func_1` is called to precompute the values of `dp` up to `300000`.

2. **Precomputation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - `dp[1]` is set to `1` because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2]` is set to `3` because there are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board: (1,1), (2,2); (1,2), (2,1); and (1,1), (2,2) with no additional moves.
   - For `i` from `3` to `n`, the number of configurations is computed using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
     This relation accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the different ways to place rooks in the remaining board.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the number of rows and columns `n` and the number of initial moves `k` are read.
   - A set `invalid` is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each of the `k` moves, the row and column are added to the `invalid` set.
   - The number of remaining free rows and columns is calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result for the test case is the precomputed value `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly computes the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.
