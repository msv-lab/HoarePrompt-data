Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in handling the case where the distance between the first and last chosen vertices is being calculated. Specifically, the line `elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:` uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` instead of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` to check the condition and update `y`. This will lead to incorrect results in cases where the distance between the first and last chosen vertices is even and can be split into multiple triangles.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
The program should correctly handle the distance between vertex 1 and vertex 5 (which is 4, an even number), but due to the incorrect condition, it might not handle this case properly.
