You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each tuple satisfies the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has iterated `tt` times, and for each iteration, it has processed the input values `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. The final output for each test case is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, where `ans` is calculated based on the given logic. The variables `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, and `tmp` are updated within each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The function `max_triangles` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `tt` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from input. It then calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed based on the given logic and prints the minimum of this calculated value and `n - 2`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `tt` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the calculated result has been printed. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, and `tmp` are updated within each iteration, but their final values are not retained after the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen.
   - The vertices are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because, in the worst case, we can form `x + y - 2` triangles by connecting all chosen and additional vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

4. **Gap Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices `a` to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it means we can form an additional triangle by connecting these vertices with the vertex in between, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, and we have enough additional vertices `y` to fill the gap, we can form more triangles. The number of additional triangles is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and we decrement `y` by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` to account for the vertices used.

5. **Handling the Wrap-around Gap:**
   - The program also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the wrap-around nature of the polygon.
   - If this gap is exactly 2, it means we can form an additional triangle, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, and we have enough additional vertices `y` to fill the gap, we can form more triangles. The number of additional triangles is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and we decrement `y` by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` to account for the vertices used.

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - After considering all gaps, the program adds any remaining additional vertices `y` to `ans`.
   - The final answer is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Issues:
- **Indexing Error:**
  - In the wrap-around gap calculation, the program uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` instead of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` for the gap calculation. This is incorrect and should be fixed.

- **Redundant Condition:**
  - The condition `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is used twice, once in the main loop and once in the wrap-around gap check. This is redundant and can be simplified.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = x + y - 2
        tmp = []
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            ans += (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1
        ans += y
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program is not corrected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program has an indexing error in the wrap-around gap calculation, which needs to be fixed to ensure the correct logic is applied.
