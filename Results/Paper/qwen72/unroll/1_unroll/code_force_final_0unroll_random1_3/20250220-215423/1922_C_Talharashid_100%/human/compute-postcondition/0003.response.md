Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city positions in ascending order and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the difference in the cumulative distances to the closest city for the specified cities. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results of the queries. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the program state is reset to read the next set of inputs. **
