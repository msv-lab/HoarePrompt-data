t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list containing two elements: the first is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second is a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
