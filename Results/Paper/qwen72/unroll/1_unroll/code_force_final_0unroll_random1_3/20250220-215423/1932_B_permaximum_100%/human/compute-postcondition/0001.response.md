The only objects in the loop head are `test` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `results` is also not part of the loop head, so it remains as is.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one element, and `test` will be the first element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements that must have at least 1 element, `test` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
