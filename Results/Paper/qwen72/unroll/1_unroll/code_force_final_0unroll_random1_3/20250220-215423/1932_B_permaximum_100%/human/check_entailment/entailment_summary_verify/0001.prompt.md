You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged after the function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Test Case Storage:**
   - The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in the `test_cases` list, which is a reasonable way to organize the data.

3. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases. It takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Inside the function, a list `results` is initialized to store the results for each test case.

5. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0, which is the starting year.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.

6. **Calculating the Next Year:**
   - The program checks if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` using `current_year % ai == 0`.
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year is calculated as `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

7. **Updating Current Year:**
   - The `current_year` is updated to `next_year` after each sign is processed.

8. **Storing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.

9. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the next year is correct. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- The program correctly handles the sequential nature of the signs by updating `current_year` to the next year after each sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
- For the first test case:
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 3 (first sign)
    - 4 (second sign)
    - 8 (third sign)
    - 10 (fourth sign)
    - 18 (fifth sign)
    - 36 (sixth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 36.

- For the second test case:
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 1 (first sign)
    - 2 (second sign)
    - 3 (third sign)
    - 4 (fourth sign)
    - 5 (fifth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the third test case:
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 1 (first sign)
    - 2 (second sign)
    - 3 (third sign)
    - 4 (fourth sign)
    - 5 (fifth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the fourth test case:
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - The signs occur in the years:
    - 50 (first sign)
    - 60 (second sign)
    - 711 (third sign)
    - 800 (fourth sign)
    - 1006 (fifth sign)
    - 2012 (sixth sign)
  - The program correctly outputs 2012.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
