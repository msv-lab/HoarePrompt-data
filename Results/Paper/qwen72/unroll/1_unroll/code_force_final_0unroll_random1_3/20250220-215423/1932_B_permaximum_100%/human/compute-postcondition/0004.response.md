The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a list `results`, where each element in `results` is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding list `a` from `test_cases`.**
