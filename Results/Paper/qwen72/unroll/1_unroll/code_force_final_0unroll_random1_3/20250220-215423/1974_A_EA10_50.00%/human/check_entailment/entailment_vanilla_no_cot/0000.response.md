Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens needed. Specifically, the variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which is intended to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the calculation of `m` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the space available for 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
        screens_for_2x2 = (y * 4 + 14) // 15
        # Calculate the remaining space on the last screen after placing 2x2 icons.
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15
        # Total number of screens needed.
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)
```

Explanation:
1. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons**: Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. The formula `(y * 4 + 14) // 15` ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons.
2. **Calculate the remaining space on the last screen**: After placing the 2x2 icons, we calculate the remaining space on the last screen using `15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4`.
3. **Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons**: The formula `(x - remaining_space + 14) // 15` ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number of screens needed to fit all 1x1 icons, considering the remaining space on the last screen.
4. **Total number of screens**: The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

This corrected version should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
