Output State: **The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on user input for each iteration of the loop, and `z` is calculated and printed for each iteration. The value of `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `a` times.
- In each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated with new values provided by the user.
- `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`.
- If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is updated to `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
- The updated value of `z` is printed for each iteration.
- The value of `a` remains the same throughout the loop execution.
