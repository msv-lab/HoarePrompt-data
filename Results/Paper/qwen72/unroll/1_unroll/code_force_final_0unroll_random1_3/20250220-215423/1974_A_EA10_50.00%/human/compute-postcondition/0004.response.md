Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `a` from user input, and for each of the `a` iterations, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input. For each iteration, it calculates a value `z` based on `x` and `y`, and prints `z`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated with each iteration, and the value of `a` remains unchanged throughout the function execution. **
