You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer with a maximum value of \(10^{12}\). It modifies `k` by dividing it by 2 and initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates over the range from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, incrementing a counter `c` at each step. If `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, the function returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, it updates `k` and modifies `l` using `func_3(c, l)`. After the loop, the function returns the final state of `l`. The final state of the program is that `c` is \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil\), `k` is the result of the loop updates, and `l` is the result of applying `func_3` to `l` for each iteration or the result of `func_2` if the loop terminates early.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, and l is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of l, and 0 <= c < len(l) and 0 <= c + k < len(l).
def func_2(c, k, l):

    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` which is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of `l`. The list `l` contains the integers in some order, and the values of `x` and `y` are elements of `l` at the positions `-c - k` and `-c` respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`, where `c` and `k` are non-negative integers, and `l` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, with n being the length of `l`. It returns the list `l` with the elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c` swapped. The final state of the program is that the list `l` has the same elements but with the specified elements at the positions `-c - k` and `-c` exchanged.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer, l is a list of integers of length n, and 1 <= c <= n/2.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]

    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` where the c-th element from the start has been replaced by the c-th element from the end, and the c-th element from the end has been replaced by the c-th element from the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l`. It returns the list `l` with the `c`-th element from the start and the `c`-th element from the end swapped. The original list `l` is modified in place.

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns (0, 0)
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `k` is even.

    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the integer `n` and the even integer `k`, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is even but greater than the maximum allowed value `max_k`. If `k` is even and less than or equal to `max_k`, it returns the integers `n` and `k`. The value of `max_k` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even. The function ensures that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`.

    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    return
    #The program returns nothing, but the integers in the list `l` are printed in the same order as they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of unique integers in the range [1, n] and prints the string 'YES'. It then prints the integers in the list `l` in the same order as they appear, separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not modify the list `l` and returns nothing.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_6():
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves two non-negative integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_5` with the result of `func_1`. The function does not return any value in this case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. For `k = 0`, the permutation should be the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, but the program does not ensure this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `k`**: The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible `k` incorrectly. For a permutation of length `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is `n * (n - 1)`, not `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` or `n ** 2 // 2`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is not clear and may not always produce a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value. Specifically, the indices used in the swaps may go out of bounds or not achieve the desired `k`.

4. **Incorrect Return Values**: The function `func_4` returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd or when `k` exceeds the maximum possible value. This is not consistent with the problem description, which requires printing "No" in such cases.

5. **Input Handling**: The function `func_6` assumes that the input is provided in a specific format and does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- **Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  Yes
  3 1 2
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program may not produce the correct permutation or may produce an incorrect one due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
