Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. For `k = 0`, the permutation should be the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, but the program does not ensure this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `k`**: The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible `k` incorrectly. For a permutation of length `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is `n * (n - 1)`, not `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` or `n ** 2 // 2`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is not clear and may not always produce a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value. Specifically, the indices used in the swaps may go out of bounds or not achieve the desired `k`.

4. **Incorrect Return Values**: The function `func_4` returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd or when `k` exceeds the maximum possible value. This is not consistent with the problem description, which requires printing "No" in such cases.

5. **Input Handling**: The function `func_6` assumes that the input is provided in a specific format and does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- **Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  Yes
  3 1 2
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program may not produce the correct permutation or may produce an incorrect one due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
