You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - The permutation must contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function 4 (func_4)**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

3. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function generates the permutation.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to 1 in steps of 2, decrementing `k` by `i - 1` and swapping elements in the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0, it returns the list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to perform a more precise swap.
   - It calls `func_3` to perform a swap and continues the process.

4. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function performs a swap to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `l[-c]` and `l[-c - k]`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

5. **Function 3 (func_3)**:
   - This function performs a swap to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `l[c - 1]` and `l[-c]`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

6. **Function 5 (func_5)**:
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.

7. **Function 6 (func_6)**:
   - This function handles the input and output for each test case.
   - It calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print it.

### Analysis:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `k` is odd, the program correctly returns "NO" because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
  - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, the program correctly returns "NO".
  - The program handles the generation of the permutation correctly by using a combination of swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly checks for the validity of `k` and `n`.
  - The permutation generation logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by making appropriate swaps.
  - The output is correctly formatted and handles both cases where a permutation exists and where it does not.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the required cases as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
