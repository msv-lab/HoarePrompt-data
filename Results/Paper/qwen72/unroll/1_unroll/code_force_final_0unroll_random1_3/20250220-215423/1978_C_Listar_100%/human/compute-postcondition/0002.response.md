Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, and the current value of `n` is 0. However, the `print` statement does not reference `n` or `k` at all. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
