### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a 2xN grid where each cell has an arrow pointing left or right.
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, up, or down; then, it follows the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Constraints:**
   - \( n \) is even.
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row from the first row if it encounters a cell with an arrow pointing down.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move to the rightmost column (n) without getting stuck in a loop or moving outside the grid.

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(n, row1, row2):**
     - The function checks if the robot can reach (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
     - It divides the grid into segments of 2 columns each and checks if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row and then to the right.
     - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (since \( n \) is even, \( n/2 \) segments).
     - For each segment, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then move right.
     - If the robot encounters a cell in the first row that points left and the corresponding cells in the second row also point left, it returns 'No'.
     - Finally, it checks if the last cell in the first row points left and the second-to-last cell in the second row points left. If so, it returns 'No'.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **Initial State:**
     - `n` is an even integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
     - `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
   - **Loop Analysis:**
     - The loop iterates through the first half of the grid, checking for conditions where the robot is stuck.
     - The condition `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` ensures that if the robot moves left in the first row and then tries to move to the second row, it will not get stuck if the corresponding cells in the second row also point left.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check `row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<'` ensures that the robot can reach the last cell in the second row without getting stuck.
   - **State After Loop and Final Check:**
     - If the loop completes without returning 'No', and the final check also does not return 'No', the function returns 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the robot is stuck in a segment due to left-pointing arrows.
   - It also correctly checks the last segment to ensure the robot can reach the rightmost cell in the second row.

7. **Function 2:**
   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads \( n \), the first row of arrows, and the second row of arrows.
     - It calls **func_1(n, row1, row2)** for each test case and appends the result to a list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic in **func_1** is sound and handles all necessary cases, while **func_2** correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
