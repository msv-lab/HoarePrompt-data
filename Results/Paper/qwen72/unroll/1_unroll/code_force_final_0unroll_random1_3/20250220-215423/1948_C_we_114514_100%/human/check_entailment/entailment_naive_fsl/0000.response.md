Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is incomplete and does not account for all possible movements of the robot. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
><<<
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and follows the arrows as follows:
1. Moves right to (1, 2) (since the arrow at (1, 1) points right).
2. Moves right to (1, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 2) points right).
3. Moves down to (2, 3) (since the arrow at (1, 3) points down).
4. Moves left to (2, 2) (since the arrow at (2, 3) points left).
5. Moves left to (2, 1) (since the arrow at (2, 2) points left).

The robot is now stuck at (2, 1) and cannot reach (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly returns "YES" for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
