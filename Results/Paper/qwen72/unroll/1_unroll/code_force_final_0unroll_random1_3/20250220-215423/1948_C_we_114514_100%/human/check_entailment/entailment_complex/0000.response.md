Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Execution**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and collects the results in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if the robot can move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n).
   - It iterates over the first half of the columns (since `n` is even, `half_n = n // 2`).
   - The loop checks if the robot is blocked by a specific pattern of arrows:
     - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the robot is blocked, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot can move to the last column of the second row:
     - If `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<', the robot is blocked, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of the blocking conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the conditions under which the robot is blocked.
   - The loop and the final check cover all possible scenarios where the robot could be blocked from reaching (2, n).
   - The function ensures that the robot can move to the next column or row as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the smallest possible `n` (2) and the largest possible `n` (200,000) correctly.
   - The function also handles multiple test cases correctly by processing each one independently.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
