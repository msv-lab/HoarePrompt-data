The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function effectively reads a line of input from the user and splits it into substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of strings derived from the user's input.
