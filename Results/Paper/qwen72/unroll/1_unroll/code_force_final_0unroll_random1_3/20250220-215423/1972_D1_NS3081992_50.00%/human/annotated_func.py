#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is `0`), and updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus one. The function ultimately returns this updated value. The dictionary `d` and the lists `processing` and `rank` remain unchanged except for the updates to `rank[da - 1]`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers.

    #The program returns a tuple containing the values of `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the function `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= `a` <= `n` and 1 <= `b` <= `m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The function ultimately computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` as the third element of the tuple, along with two other integers that satisfy the equation `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`.

    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer that has been decreased by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` such that `0 <= n <= len(a)`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and decreases `k` by the difference `m - a[i]` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the parameters `n` and `m`. The final state of the program includes the modified value of `k` and the return value of either 1 or -1.
