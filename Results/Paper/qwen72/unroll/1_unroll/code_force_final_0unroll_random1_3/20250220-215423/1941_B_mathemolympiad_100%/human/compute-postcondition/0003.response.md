The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the question. However, given the constraints and the typical nature of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` in some way for each test case and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the elements in the list `a`.**
