### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The function iterates through the list `a` from the first element to the third-to-last element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the number of operations `opNum` that can be performed on `a[i]` without making it negative.
   - It then applies the operations to `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum`, `2 * opNum`, and `opNum` respectively.

3. **Early Termination:**
   - If any element `a[i]` becomes negative during the operations, the function prints 'NO' and stops processing the current test case.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if the last two elements `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are zero.
   - If both are zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The function does not handle the case where the array `a` might already be all zeros from the start. However, this is not a problem as the operations will not change anything, and the final check will still correctly print 'YES'.
- **Negative Values:**
  - The function correctly checks for negative values and terminates early if any are found, which is a good practice.
- **Final Elements:**
  - The function correctly checks the last two elements after all operations to determine if they are zero.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for the problem description. It handles the input and operations as expected and correctly determines if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
