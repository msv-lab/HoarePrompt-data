Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the following edge case:

**Case:**
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
For the input array `[0, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly handle the case where the array length is 4 and the elements can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations. The program only checks the last two elements after performing the operations, but it does not ensure that all elements are zero. In this case, the operations can be applied as follows:

- Apply the operation at `i=2`:
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 0`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 0`

After these operations, the array becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, which should result in "YES". However, the program will output "NO" because it does not correctly check all elements of the array.
