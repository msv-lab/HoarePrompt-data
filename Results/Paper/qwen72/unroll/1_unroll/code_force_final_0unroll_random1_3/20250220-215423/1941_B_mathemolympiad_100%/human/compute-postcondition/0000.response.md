Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, `numTest` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `a`. The variable `numTest` is assigned the value of the input integer.
