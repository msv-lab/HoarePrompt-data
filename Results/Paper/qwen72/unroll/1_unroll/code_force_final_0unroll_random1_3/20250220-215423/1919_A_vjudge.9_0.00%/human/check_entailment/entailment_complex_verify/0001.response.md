### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. The player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
     2. The player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet, provided the wallet is not empty.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially a turn-based game where the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
     - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - The function is correct because it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. This is a valid approach because the game is symmetric and the total number of moves (which is `a + b - 1` for each player) determines the winner. If the total number of moves is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the values of `a` and `b` to determine the winner for each test case.
     - It stores the results in a list and prints them one by one.
     - The function is correct as it correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1, as shown in the example.
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)), as specified in the problem description.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases, as specified by the input format.

5. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - `func_1` correctly returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
