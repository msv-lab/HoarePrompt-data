You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a number of test cases `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list, one by one. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. The player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
     2. The player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet, provided the wallet is not empty.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially a turn-based game where the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
     - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This function is correct because it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the values of `a` and `b` to determine the winner for each test case.
     - It stores the results in a list and prints them one by one.
     - This function is also correct as it correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1, as shown in the example.
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)), as specified in the problem description.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases, as specified by the input format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
