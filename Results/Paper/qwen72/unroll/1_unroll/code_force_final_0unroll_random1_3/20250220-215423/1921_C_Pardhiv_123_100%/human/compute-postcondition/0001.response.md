The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is certain that `t` will be greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute at least once.

State: **t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9, and m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
