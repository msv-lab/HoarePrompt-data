Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are now empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` to empty lists. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and the list `numbers` remain unchanged.
