Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it prints '12' to convert it to 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour `h` is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary (using `0{}` format).

3. **Minute Handling**: The function prints the minutes `s[2:]` as they are, since minutes are the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

4. **AM/PM Determination**: The function appends 'AM' if the hour `h` is less than 12, and 'PM' if the hour `h` is 12 or greater.

5. **Output Format**: The function ensures that the output format is exactly as specified in the problem description, with the time and AM/PM separated by a space.

Let's break down the function step by step to ensure it meets all the requirements:

- **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the time strings.
- **Hour Conversion**:
  - For `00:00`, it correctly prints `12:00 AM`.
  - For `09:41`, it correctly prints `09:41 AM`.
  - For `18:06`, it correctly prints `06:06 PM`.
  - For `12:14`, it correctly prints `12:14 PM`.
  - For `21:37`, it correctly prints `09:37 PM`.
- **Minute Handling**: The minutes are printed as they are, which is correct.
- **AM/PM Determination**: The function correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

The function handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
