Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is exactly 12 in the 24-hour format. According to the problem description, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 PM" in 12-hour format. However, the program will output "00:00 PM" for "12:00", which is incorrect.
