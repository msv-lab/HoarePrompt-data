Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The loop will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it, followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the time. The variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
