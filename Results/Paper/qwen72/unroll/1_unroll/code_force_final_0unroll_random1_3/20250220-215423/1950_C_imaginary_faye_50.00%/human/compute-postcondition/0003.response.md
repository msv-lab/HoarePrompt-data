Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
