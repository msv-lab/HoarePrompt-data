Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format. This part of the function is accurate.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it prints '12' to convert it to 12-hour format. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. This is correct because these hours are the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.
   - If the hour `h` is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary (using `0{}` format). This is also correct. For example, 18:06 in 24-hour format should be 06:06 PM in 12-hour format.

3. **Minute Handling**: The function prints the minutes `s[2:]` as they are, which is correct because the minutes are the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

4. **AM/PM Determination**: The function appends 'AM' if the hour `h` is less than 12, and 'PM' if the hour `h` is 12 or greater. This is correct. For example, 12:14 in 24-hour format should be 12:14 PM in 12-hour format, and 09:41 in 24-hour format should be 09:41 AM in 12-hour format.

5. **Output Format**: The function ensures that the output format is exactly as specified in the problem description, with the time and AM/PM separated by a space. This is correct.

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

- For `00:00`, the function prints `12:00 AM`.
- For `09:41`, the function prints `09:41 AM`.
- For `18:06`, the function prints `06:06 PM`.
- For `12:14`, the function prints `12:14 PM`.
- For `21:37`, the function prints `09:37 PM`.

All these outputs are correct and match the expected results.

However, there is a small issue in the hour conversion logic when the hour is exactly '12'. According to the 12-hour format, '12' should always be printed as '12' regardless of whether it is AM or PM. The current implementation correctly handles this, but it is worth noting that the logic for `h == '12'` should be separate from the logic for `int(h) <= 12` to avoid any potential confusion.

Here is a slightly modified version of the function to make the logic clearer:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif h == '12':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) < 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

Despite this minor improvement, the original function is still correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
