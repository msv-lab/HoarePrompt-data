Reasoning:  
The provided program `func_1` is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the results. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - The minute part `s[2:]` is used directly as it remains the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If the hour is '00', it prints '12' to represent midnight in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.

4. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - The program appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12.
   - The program appends 'PM' if the hour is 12 or greater.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM' for each test case.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **09:41** -> 09 is less than 12, so it prints "09:41 AM".
- **18:06** -> 18 is greater than 12, so it prints "06:06 PM" (18 - 12 = 6).
- **12:14** -> 12 is equal to 12, so it prints "12:14 PM".
- **00:59** -> 00 is midnight, so it prints "12:59 AM".
- **00:00** -> 00 is midnight, so it prints "12:00 AM".
- **14:34** -> 14 is greater than 12, so it prints "02:34 PM" (14 - 12 = 2).
- **01:01** -> 01 is less than 12, so it prints "01:01 AM".
- **19:07** -> 19 is greater than 12, so it prints "07:07 PM" (19 - 12 = 7).
- **11:59** -> 11 is less than 12, so it prints "11:59 AM".
- **12:00** -> 12 is equal to 12, so it prints "12:00 PM".
- **21:37** -> 21 is greater than 12, so it prints "09:37 PM" (21 - 12 = 9).

All the conversions and outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
