Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur sequentially and the year for the next sign must be strictly after the previous sign. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
The expected output is `10`, but the program will output `5`. Here's why:

- The first sign occurs in year 2.
- The second sign should occur strictly after year 2, which is in year 5.
- The third sign should occur strictly after year 5, which is in year 10.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the year for the second and third signs as follows:
- For the first sign, `year` is 0, and `year % 2` is 0, so `year` becomes 2.
- For the second sign, `year` is 2, and `year % 3` is 2, so `year` becomes 2 + 2 = 4 (which is incorrect, it should be 5).
- For the third sign, `year` is 4, and `year % 5` is 4, so `year` becomes 4 + 4 = 8 (which is incorrect, it should be 10).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the requirement that the signs must occur strictly after the previous sign.
