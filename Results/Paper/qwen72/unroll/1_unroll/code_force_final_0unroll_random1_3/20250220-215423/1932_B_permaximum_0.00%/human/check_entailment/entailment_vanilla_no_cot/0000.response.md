Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it updates the `year` as follows:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`
     - This expression ensures that if `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it adds `ai` to `year`. Otherwise, it adds the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `year`.

This logic correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description accurately.
