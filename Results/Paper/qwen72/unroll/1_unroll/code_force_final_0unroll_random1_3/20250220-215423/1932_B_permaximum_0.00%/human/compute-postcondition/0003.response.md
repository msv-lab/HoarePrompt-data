The function `func` does not have any parameters explicitly listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a_i` where:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000,
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,
- `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n.

The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100), and a list of integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
