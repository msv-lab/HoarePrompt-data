### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters '<' and '>'. A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character and inverts it after moving.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each placing a pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the length `n` and the string `s` of length `n`.
   - The output should be `n` integers, each representing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the corresponding cell.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed by iterating from left to right and keeping track of the positions of '>' characters.
   - `B` is computed by iterating from right to left and keeping track of the positions of '<' characters.
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the precomputed values from `A` and `B`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Precompute `A`:**
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the current character is '>', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '>' character and add it to the `A` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '>' characters in `idx_A`.

   - **Precompute `B`:**
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the current character is '<', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '<' character and add it to the `B` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '<' characters in `idx_B`.

   - **Answer Queries:**
     - For each cell, determine the direction of the pinball.
     - Use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve combining the steps from `A` and `B` and adjusting for the current position and the number of steps required to invert the characters.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Precomputation of `A`:**
     - The loop correctly builds the `A` array by iterating from left to right and accumulating the steps required to reach the next '>' character.
     - The `idx_A` list keeps track of the positions of '>' characters, which is used to adjust the steps in the `A` array.

   - **Precomputation of `B`:**
     - The loop correctly builds the `B` array by iterating from right to left and accumulating the steps required to reach the next '<' character.
     - The `idx_B` list keeps track of the positions of '<' characters, which is used to adjust the steps in the `B` array.

   - **Query Answering:**
     - The program correctly handles the logic for each cell based on the direction of the pinball.
     - The calculations for the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid are complex but follow the rules of the problem.
     - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the grid.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The precomputation steps for `A` and `B` are both O(n).
   - The query answering step is also O(n).
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The precomputation and query answering steps are well thought out and handle the problem constraints effectively. The annotations and the original assessment align with the correct behavior of the program.

Final: **True**
