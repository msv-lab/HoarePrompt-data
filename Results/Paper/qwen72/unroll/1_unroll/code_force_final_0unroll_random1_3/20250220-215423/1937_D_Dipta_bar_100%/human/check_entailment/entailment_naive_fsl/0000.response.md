Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'. For example, if the input string is "<<<", the program will produce incorrect output. The logic in the program assumes that there are both '<' and '>' characters in the string, and it does not handle the edge case where the string is composed of a single type of character. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid when it starts on a cell with a single type of character (all '<' or all '>') is flawed. 

For the input:
```
1
3
<<<
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2 3
```
However, the program will produce an incorrect output.
