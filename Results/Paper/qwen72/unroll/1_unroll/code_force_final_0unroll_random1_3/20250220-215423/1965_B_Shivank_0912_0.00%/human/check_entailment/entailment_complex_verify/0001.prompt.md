You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. results is a list containing t elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). sequence is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., sequence = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]).

    #The program returns a list 'results' containing 't' elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The 'sequence' list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(25, sequence)`. The `sequence` list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `cases`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and the pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.

2. **Sequence Generation:**
   - The program generates a sequence of the first 25 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because the sum of any subset of these numbers is unique and can represent any number in the range from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\).

3. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program appends the tuple `(25, sequence)` to the results list.
   - This means that for each test case, the program outputs a sequence of size 25, which is the maximum allowed size.

4. **Conditions Check:**
   - **Condition 1:** "There is no subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(k\)."
     - The sequence generated is a set of powers of 2, and the sum of any subset of these numbers is unique. Therefore, if \(k\) is not a sum of any subset of these numbers, the condition is satisfied.
   - **Condition 2:** "For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\)."
     - The sequence of powers of 2 can represent any number from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\), which is much larger than the maximum value of \(n\) (10^6). Therefore, any number \(v\) in the range \(1 \le v \le n\) can be represented as a sum of a subset of these numbers, except for \(k\) if it is not a sum of any subset.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where \(k\) is a power of 2 or a sum of powers of 2. However, the problem guarantees that a solution always exists, and the sequence of powers of 2 is a valid solution for all test cases within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all test cases. The sequence of the first 25 powers of 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) and that all other values \(v\) in the range \(1 \le v \le n\) can be represented as a sum of a subsequence.
