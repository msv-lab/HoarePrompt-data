The function `func_1` does not take any parameters directly but reads input from the user. The first input is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 1000, indicating the number of disks. The next `n` inputs are tuples, each containing three integers: `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. Here, `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. The constraints for these values are -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.

The function returns the number of disks that do not overlap with any other disk. Disks are considered to overlap if they share any common area, including touching at a single point.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and `n` tuples of coordinates and radii of disks from the user. It returns the number of disks that do not overlap with any other disk.**
