Output State: **`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `ok`, which is now set to `False`.
