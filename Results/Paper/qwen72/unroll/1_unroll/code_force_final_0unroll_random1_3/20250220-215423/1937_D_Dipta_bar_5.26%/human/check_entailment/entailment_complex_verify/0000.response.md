### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step.

1. **Initial Setup and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `idx_A`, to keep track of the cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from left to right. For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative count and appends it to `A`, and appends the index to `idx_A`.
   - Similarly, it initializes two lists, `B` and `idx_B`, to keep track of the cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from right to left. For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative count and appends it to `B`, and appends the index to `idx_B`.

3. **Main Calculation Loop:**
   - The function then iterates through the string `s` again to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - If the current character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative counts and indices stored in `A` and `B`.
   - If the current character is '<', it calculates the time using the cumulative counts and indices stored in `A` and `B`.

4. **Handling the Last Cell:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case when the pinball is placed on the last cell and the last cell is a '>'. Specifically, it states that for the input `">>>"`, the program outputs `1 2 3` instead of `1 2 1`.

Let's verify this claim by examining the relevant part of the code:

```python
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

- When the pinball is placed on the last cell (i.e., `i == n - 1`), and the last cell is '>', the program should output `1` because the pinball will move to the right and leave the grid immediately.
- The relevant condition in the code is:
  ```python
  elif r == 0:
      print(n - i, end=' ')
  ```
  For the last cell (`i == n - 1`), `n - i` will be `1`, which is the correct output.

### Verification with Example:
Let's run the program with the input `">>>"`:

- **Step 1:** `A` and `idx_A` will be `[0, 1, 3]` and `[0, 1, 2]` respectively.
- **Step 2:** `B` and `idx_B` will be `[0, 1, 2]` and `[2, 1, 0]` respectively.
- **Step 3:** For `i = 0` (first cell):
  - `s[0] == '>'`
  - `l = 0`, `r = 3`
  - `a = A[0] = 0`
  - `b = B[2] = 2`
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1) = 0 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 0 + 1 = 5`
- **Step 4:** For `i = 1` (second cell):
  - `s[1] == '>'`
  - `l = 1`, `r = 2`
  - `a = A[1] = 1`
  - `b = B[1] = 1`
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1) = 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 5`
- **Step 5:** For `i = 2` (third cell):
  - `s[2] == '>'`
  - `l = 2`, `r = 1`
  - `r == 0` is not true, so we go to the next condition:
  - `a = B[0] = 0`
  - `b = A[1] = 1`
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)) = 0 * 2 + 1 * 2 + (3 - 2) = 3`

The output for `">>>"` is `5 5 3`, which is incorrect. However, the original assessment's claim that the program outputs `1 2 3` is also incorrect. The actual output is `5 5 3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect in its claim that the program outputs `1 2 3` for the input `">>>"`. The program actually outputs `5 5 3`, which is still incorrect but for a different reason. The program does not handle the cumulative counts and indices correctly, leading to incorrect calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
