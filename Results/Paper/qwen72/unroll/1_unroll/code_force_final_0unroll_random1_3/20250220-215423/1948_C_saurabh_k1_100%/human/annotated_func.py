#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly n characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. t must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `n` and the list of tuples containing the strings of arrows for each test case remain unchanged. The loop prints 'No' or 'yes' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it prints 'No' if there is a position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, and 'yes' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function then checks if there is any odd-indexed position `i` in the strings such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If such a condition is met, it prints 'No' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer read from the input, and the behavior is undefined if `t` is out of the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, or any `n` is out of the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, or `n` is not even, or the sum of all `n` values exceeds 2 · 10^5.
