Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `n` and the list of tuples containing the strings of arrows for each test case remain unchanged. The loop prints 'No' or 'yes' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it prints 'No' if there is a position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, and 'yes' otherwise.**
