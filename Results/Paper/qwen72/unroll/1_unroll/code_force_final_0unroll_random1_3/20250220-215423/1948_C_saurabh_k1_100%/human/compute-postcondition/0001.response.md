The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer provided by the user and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user and must be at least 1, `n` is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. Each `n` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` is even, and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
