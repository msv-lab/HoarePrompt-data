The function should take three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly n characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. t must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
