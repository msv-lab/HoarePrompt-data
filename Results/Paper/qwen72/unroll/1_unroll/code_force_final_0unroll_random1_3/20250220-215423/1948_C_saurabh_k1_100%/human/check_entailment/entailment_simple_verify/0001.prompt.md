You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly n characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. t must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `n` and the list of tuples containing the strings of arrows for each test case remain unchanged. The loop prints 'No' or 'yes' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it prints 'No' if there is a position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, and 'yes' otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it chooses a direction (left, right, up, or down), and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the input includes the number of columns `n`, the arrows in the first row `a`, and the arrows in the second row `b`.
   - The output should be "YES" if the robot can reach cell (2, n), and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must move to the right to reach the target cell (2, n), as it starts at (1, 1).
   - The robot can only move to the right if the arrows in the current and next cells allow it.
   - Specifically, if the robot is in the first row and encounters a '<' arrow, it must move to the second row to continue moving right.
   - Similarly, if the robot is in the second row and encounters a '<' arrow, it must move to the first row to continue moving right.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the arrows in the first row `a`, and the arrows in the second row `b`.
   - The program then iterates over the columns in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1).
   - It checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can be blocked from moving to the right:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', the robot will be stuck in a loop between these two cells.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', the robot will be stuck in a loop between these two cells.
   - If either of these conditions is met, the program prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any blocking conditions, the program prints "yes".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can be blocked from moving to the right.
   - However, the program prints "No" and "yes" in lowercase, which does not match the problem description that states the output can be in any case (e.g., "YES", "Yes", "YeS").
   - The program should print "NO" and "YES" to be fully correct.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints "No" and "yes" in lowercase, which does not meet the problem's requirement that the output can be in any case (e.g., "YES", "Yes", "YeS"). The logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is correct, but the output format is not.
