Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility that the robot can move up or down after moving left or right. The program only checks for specific conditions where the robot might get stuck, but it does not fully simulate the robot's movement to ensure it can reach the target cell (2, n).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
The correct output should be "YES" because the robot can follow this path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (1, 4) → (2, 4). However, the program will output "No" because it only checks for specific conditions and does not simulate the entire movement process.

This input demonstrates a case where the program does not work as expected, hence the program is incorrect.
