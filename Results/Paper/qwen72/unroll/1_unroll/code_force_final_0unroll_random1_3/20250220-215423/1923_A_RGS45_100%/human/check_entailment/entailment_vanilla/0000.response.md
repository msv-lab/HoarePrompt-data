### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.
   - The array `arr` is read as a string and any spaces are removed.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.

3. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray that contains all the chips and no free cells before the first chip or after the last chip.
   - This subarray `z` is the segment of the ribbon where all chips are located.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z`.
   - The number of free cells in this subarray is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips.
  - By counting the free cells in this segment, it correctly determines the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all chips are already in a single block, the subarray `z` will contain no free cells, and the count will be 0, which is correct.
  - If there are no free cells between the first and last chip, the count will also be 0, which is correct.
  - If there are free cells between the chips, the count will be the number of these free cells, which is the correct number of operations needed.

- **Input and Output Constraints**:
  - The function handles the input constraints correctly, reading `t` test cases and processing each one with the given `n` and `arr`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
