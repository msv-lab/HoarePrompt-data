### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a list of integers.

2. **String Conversion**: The input list of integers is converted to a string `arr` to facilitate the use of string methods like `find` and slicing. This is a valid approach since the input is binary (0s and 1s).

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: 
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first occurrence of '1'. This index is then used to calculate the position of the last chip in the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**: 
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This is done by slicing the string from `x` to `n - y`.

5. **Counting Free Cells**: 
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0s) in the extracted substring and prints it. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program assumes that there is at least one chip in each test case, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
- **String Slicing**: The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is correct because `n - y` gives the correct end index for the substring that includes the last chip.
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm correctly identifies the minimum number of operations by counting the free cells between the first and last chip. This is because moving chips to the leftmost position of the block will always result in the minimum number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output as expected, and the algorithm is correct for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
