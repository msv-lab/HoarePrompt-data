Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a correct solution to the problem. It generates a sequence of non-negative integers that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the parameters `n` and `k` for each test case using `func_10()` and `func_7()`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program handles the special case where `k` is 1. It ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 but all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed.
   - For other values of `k`, the program constructs a sequence `ans` that avoids any subsequence summing to `k` but allows all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

3. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program uses the binary representation of `n` and `k` to determine the necessary elements in the sequence.
   - For `k == 1`, it adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`, ensuring that no subsequence sums to 1.
   - For `k > 1`, it adds powers of 2 up to `k-1`, then adds `k-1-sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not equal `k`. It also adds `k+1` and `2*k+1` to cover the remaining values.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

The logic and structure of the program align with the problem requirements, and the sequence generation ensures that the conditions are met. Therefore, the program is correct.
