The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values obtained from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The first value in the returned tuple is `y`, the second value is `x - (a // b) * y`, and the third value is `g`.
