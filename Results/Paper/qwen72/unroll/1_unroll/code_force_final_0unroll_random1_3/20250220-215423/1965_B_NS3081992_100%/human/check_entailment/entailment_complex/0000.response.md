### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_14()` is called `t` times within `func_15()`, and each call processes a single test case.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - The function then constructs a sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**:
     - If `n == 2`, the function returns the string '1\n2', which is correct because the sequence `[2]` has a subsequence sum of 2 but not 1.
     - Otherwise, the function constructs a sequence `ans` containing powers of 2 from 2 to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding 1) can be formed by subsets of `ans`.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**:
     - The function constructs a sequence `ans` containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of `ans` is just below `k`.
     - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum.
     - Finally, it adds additional powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\) to cover the remaining values up to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_14()` returns a string in the format `m\na1 a2 ... am`, where `m` is the length of the sequence `ans` and `a1, a2, ..., am` are the elements of `ans`.
   - `func_15()` prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- **Correctness for `k == 1`**:
  - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding 1) can be formed by subsets of the sequence.
  - The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to 1.

- **Correctness for `k > 1`**:
  - The sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., k-1-sum(ans), k+1, 2*k+1, 8, 16, ...]` ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsets of the sequence.
  - The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to `k` because:
    - `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is chosen such that the sum of the sequence is just below `k`.
    - `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any combination of the elements in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `ans` that meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs. The sequence is of size at most 25, and it ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
