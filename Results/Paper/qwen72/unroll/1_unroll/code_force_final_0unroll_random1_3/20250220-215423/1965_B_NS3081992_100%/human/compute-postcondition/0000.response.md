The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, the result of `func_10()` must be greater than 0. Since the function does not take any parameters and the initial state does not provide any information about the variables in the loop head, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is not relevant**
