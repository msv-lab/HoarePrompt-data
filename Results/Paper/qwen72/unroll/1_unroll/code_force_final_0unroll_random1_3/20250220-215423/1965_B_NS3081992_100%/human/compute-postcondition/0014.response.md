The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `lk`. For the loop to execute, `lk` must be greater than 1, because the loop iterates from 0 to `lk - 2` (inclusive). Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lk` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is a binary string representing `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
