t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5; a is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n; b is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1; d is a list of q integers such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
