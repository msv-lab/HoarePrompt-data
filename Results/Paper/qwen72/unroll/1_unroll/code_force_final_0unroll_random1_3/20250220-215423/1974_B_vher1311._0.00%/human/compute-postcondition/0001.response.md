Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.** 

The variables `i` and `j` have been initialized. `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to the length of `unique_chars` minus 1. The initial state of `s` and `unique_chars` remains unchanged.
