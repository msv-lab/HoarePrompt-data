**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The encoding algorithm first constructs a string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Then, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (first with last, second with second last, etc.).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Step 1:** It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `s`.
   - **Step 2:** It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the `unique_chars` list, respectively.
   - **Step 3:** It iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces the character in `s` with the character at position `j` in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at position `i` in `unique_chars`, increments `i` and `j`.
   - **Step 4:** It returns the modified `unique_chars` list joined into a string.

4. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The logic for decoding is incorrect. The function should not modify the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters. Instead, it should create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters and use this mapping to decode the entire string.
   - The `replace` method is used incorrectly. It replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, which is not suitable for this problem where we need to replace characters one by one based on their positions in the `unique_chars` list.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Construct the `unique_chars` list from the encoded string `b`.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `unique_chars`.
   - Use this mapping to decode the entire string `b`.

6. **Proposed Correct Function:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
       mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
       decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
       return decoded_str
   ```

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm. It incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list and uses the `replace` method in a way that does not preserve the original positions of characters.

**Correctness: **False**
