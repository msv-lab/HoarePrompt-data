The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it seems to implicitly work with parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` is within the range -n to n. The function is guaranteed to have at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.

The function returns a valid permutation `p` of the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that the permutation meets the specified constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. For each test case, it returns a valid permutation `p` of the list `a` that meets the specified constraints.**
