Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The algorithm works backwards from the last element of `a` to the first.
   - It initializes `mex` to `n` (the MEX of the full permutation).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - a[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - a[i]`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The key insight is that the MEX of the full permutation is `n`, and as we move backwards, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` should be correctly maintained.
   - The update `mex = mex - a[i]` ensures that the MEX of the prefix is adjusted correctly.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`. This condition is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than or equal to `mex` (since `ar[i]` is non-negative or negative). Therefore, the condition is redundant and can be simplified to `mex = mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` by ensuring that `p[i]` satisfies the given condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The update of `mex` ensures that the MEX of the prefix is correctly maintained.
   - The algorithm handles the constraints and guarantees that the output is a valid permutation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm works for the smallest possible `n` (i.e., `n = 1`).
   - The algorithm also works for larger `n` and multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - For the input `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.

However, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is redundant and can be simplified. Despite this, the program still works correctly and produces the desired output for the given problem constraints.

Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. The redundant condition does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
