Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input array `ar` contains values that would cause the MEX to be recalculated in a way that the current logic does not account for. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the `mex` variable without properly considering the MEX of the prefix of the permutation array `p`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
4 3 2 1 0
```
This is incorrect because the MEX of the prefix `[4, 3, 2, 1]` is 0, and thus `a_5` should be `0 - 0 = 0`, not `1`.

The program fails to correctly maintain the MEX of the prefix of the permutation array, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
