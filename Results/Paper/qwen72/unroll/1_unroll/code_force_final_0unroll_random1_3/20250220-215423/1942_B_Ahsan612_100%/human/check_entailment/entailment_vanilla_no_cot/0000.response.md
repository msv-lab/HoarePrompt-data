Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the MEX and updates the permutation `p`. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array, and the program needs to ensure that the calculated permutation `p` matches the given array `a` based on the MEX definition.

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
if mex > mex - ar[i]:
    mex = mex - ar[i]
```
This condition is always true because `mex - ar[i]` will always be less than `mex` (since `ar[i]` is a positive or negative integer). Therefore, this part of the code does not correctly update the MEX.

To correct this, we need to maintain a set of used integers and properly calculate the MEX for each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized to store the permutation.
   - `used` is a set to keep track of the integers that have been used in the permutation.
   - `mex` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - We iterate from the last element to the first element of `ar`.
   - For each `i`, we calculate `res[i]` as `mex + ar[i]`.
   - We add `res[i]` to the `used` set.
   - We update `mex` to the next smallest non-negative integer that is not in the `used` set.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly and satisfies the given array `a`.
