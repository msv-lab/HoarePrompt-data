To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0 by default.
2. **Variable `test_cases`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an input integer.
- Each test case contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9.
- Each test case also contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `test_cases` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
