### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \) and the list of moments \( m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n \).

2. **Initial Charge and Message Moments:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to keep track of the charge consumption for each message.

3. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the list of message moments.
   - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge \( f \) is sufficient to send the message at moment \( m_1 \) without turning off the phone. If \( m_1 < \frac{b}{a} \), it appends \( m_1 \times a \) to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the charge consumption between two consecutive messages \( m_i \) and \( m_{i-1} \) is less than \( \frac{b}{a} \). If so, it appends \( (m_i - m_{i-1}) \times a \) to `array2`.

4. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the total charge consumption for sending messages without turning off the phone.
   - It also accounts for the charge consumption when turning off and on the phone for messages that cannot be sent without turning off the phone.
   - The total charge consumption is compared with the initial charge \( f \).

5. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge \( f \), the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Condition for First Message:**
   - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. It should check if the initial charge \( f \) is sufficient to send the message at moment \( arr[0] \). The correct condition should be `if f >= arr[0] * a`.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages:**
   - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. It should check if the remaining charge after sending the previous message is sufficient to send the next message without turning off the phone. The correct condition should be `if f - sum(array2) >= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the total charge consumption by summing the elements of `array2` and then adding the charge consumption for turning off and on the phone. It should calculate the total charge consumption for sending all messages and turning off and on the phone as needed.

4. **Incorrect Output Case Sensitivity:**
   - The output should be case-insensitive, but the program prints "Yes" and "No" in lowercase. It should print "YES" and "NO" to match the problem requirements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate the total charge consumption
        total_charge = f
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if total_charge >= arr[0] * a:
                    total_charge -= arr[0] * a
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                if total_charge >= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a:
                    total_charge -= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
                else:
                    if total_charge + b >= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a:
                        total_charge = total_charge + b - (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        else:
            print('YES')

```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors in the conditions and charge consumption calculations, and it does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem.
