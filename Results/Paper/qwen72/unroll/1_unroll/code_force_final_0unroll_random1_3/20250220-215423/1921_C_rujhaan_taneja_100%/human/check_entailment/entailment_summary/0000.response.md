### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - It iterates through the list of message times `arr`:
     - For the first message (`i == 0`), it checks if the time to send the message is less than the time it would take to turn the phone off and on (`b / a`). If so, it adds the charge consumption for the message to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks the time difference between the current and previous message. If this time difference is less than the time it would take to turn the phone off and on (`b / a`), it adds the charge consumption for the message to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption Check:**
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption required to send all messages by summing the values in `array2`.
   - It also accounts for the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on for messages not included in `array2` by adding `(n - len(array2)) * b` to the total.
   - Finally, it compares the total charge consumption to the initial charge `f` and prints 'Yes' if the total is less than or equal to `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for First Message:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. It should be `if arr[0] * a < f` to check if the phone has enough charge to send the first message without turning it off and on.
- **Incorrect Total Charge Consumption Calculation:**
  - The condition `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f` is incorrect. It should be `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f` to check if the total charge consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a < f:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program has logical errors as explained above.)
