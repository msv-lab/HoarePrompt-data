Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Charge Consumption:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the charge consumption for each message interval and stores it in `array2`. However, the logic for determining when to turn the phone off and on is flawed.
   - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` and `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` are not correctly handling the charge consumption. These conditions should be checking if the phone can remain on long enough to send the message without turning off, but the current logic is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Summation and Comparison:**
   - The program sums the charge consumption for the intervals where the phone is on and then adds the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on. However, the formula `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b` is not correctly accounting for the total charge consumption.
   - The total charge consumption should be calculated as the sum of the charge lost while the phone is on plus the charge lost due to turning the phone off and on.

3. **Handling of Initial Charge:**
   - The initial charge `f` should be compared against the total charge consumption, but the current logic does not correctly handle this comparison.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to calculate the total charge consumption for each test case and compare it with the initial charge `f`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total charge consumption
        total_charge = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                # Charge consumption for the first message
                total_charge += arr[0] * a
            else:
                # Charge consumption for the interval between messages
                interval = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
                if interval * a < b:
                    total_charge += interval * a
                else:
                    total_charge += b
        
        # Check if the total charge consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge
        if total_charge <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:**
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
  - Read the message times into a list `arr`.

- **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
  - Initialize `total_charge` to 0.
  - For the first message, calculate the charge consumption from moment 0 to the first message time.
  - For subsequent messages, calculate the charge consumption for the interval between the current and the previous message. If the charge consumption for the interval is less than the charge lost by turning the phone off and on, use the interval charge. Otherwise, use the charge lost by turning the phone off and on.

- **Comparison:**
  - If the total charge consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`, print "Yes".
  - Otherwise, print "No".

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
