### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `test_cases` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input and stores them in the list `feat`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `arr` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` to calculate the charge consumption for each message:
     - For the first message (`i == 0`), it checks if the initial charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks if the charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on between the current and previous message. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption required to send all messages by summing the values in `array2`.
   - It also accounts for the additional charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially. The number of times the phone is turned off and on is `n - len(array2)`, and each turn-off and turn-on action consumes `b` units of charge.
   - The function then checks if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumption is less than or equal to `f`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for First Message:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. It should be `if arr[0] * a <= f` to check if the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message.
- **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages:**
  - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. It should be `if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a <= f - sum(array2) - (n - len(array2)) * b` to check if the remaining charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on.
- **Incorrect Total Charge Consumption Calculation:**
  - The total charge consumption should be calculated as `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b` and compared with `f`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a <= f:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            else:
                if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a <= f - sum(array2) - (n - len(array2)) * b:
                    array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **False** because the original program has logical errors in the conditions for checking the charge consumption and the total charge consumption calculation.

### Explanation:
- The original program does not correctly handle the conditions for sending messages, leading to incorrect results in some test cases.
- The corrected program ensures that the conditions for sending messages are properly checked and the total charge consumption is accurately calculated, leading to the correct output for each test case.
