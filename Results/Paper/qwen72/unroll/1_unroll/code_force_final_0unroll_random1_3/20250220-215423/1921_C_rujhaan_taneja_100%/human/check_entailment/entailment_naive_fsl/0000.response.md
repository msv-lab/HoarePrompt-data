Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if Stepan can send all messages. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of turning off and on the phone between message sending moments, which is crucial for conserving charge.

Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial charge: 11 units
- Charge loss per unit of time: 9 units
- Charge loss for turning off and on: 6 units
- Message moments: 6, 8, 10

Let's break down the logic:
1. At moment 0, the phone has 11 units of charge.
2. To send a message at moment 6, the phone will lose 6 * 9 = 54 units of charge, which is more than the initial charge of 11. Therefore, it is impossible to send the first message without the charge dropping to 0 or below.

The program incorrectly calculates the charge consumption and does not properly handle the turning off and on of the phone to conserve charge. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
