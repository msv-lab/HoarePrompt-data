Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. For each test case, it calculates the total charge consumption required to send all messages, considering the charge consumption per unit of time `a` and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`. It prints 'Yes' if the total charge consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
