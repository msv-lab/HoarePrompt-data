Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the input values `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the array `arr`. It then calculates the cost of sending messages based on the conditions provided and prints 'Yes' if the total cost is less than `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The variables `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` are reinitialized for each test case.**
