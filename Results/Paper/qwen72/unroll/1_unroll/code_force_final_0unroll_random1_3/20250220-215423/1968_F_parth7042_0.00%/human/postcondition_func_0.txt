The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if there is a subarray whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function prints the results, with each test case's results separated by an empty line. The function does not return any value.
