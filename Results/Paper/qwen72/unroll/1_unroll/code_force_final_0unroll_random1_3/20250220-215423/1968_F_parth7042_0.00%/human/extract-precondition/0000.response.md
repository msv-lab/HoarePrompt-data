Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Each `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
