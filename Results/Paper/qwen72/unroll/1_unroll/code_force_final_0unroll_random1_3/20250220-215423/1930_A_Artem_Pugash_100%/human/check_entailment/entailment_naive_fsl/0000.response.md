Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score by selecting the minimum of each pair of integers. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the integers for each test case.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first when forming pairs.
3. **Pair Selection**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, selecting the first element of each pair (which is the minimum of the pair) and adding it to the score.
4. **Output**: The final score is printed for each test case.

The key insight is that by sorting the list and always selecting the first element of each pair, the program ensures that the smallest possible values are added to the score, which maximizes the score. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as when all numbers are the same or when the numbers are in a random order.

Thus, the program is correct for every potential case.
