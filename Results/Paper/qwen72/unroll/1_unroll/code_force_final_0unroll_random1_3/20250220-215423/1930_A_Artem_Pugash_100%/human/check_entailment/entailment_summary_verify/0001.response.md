Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from a list of 2n integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The key to maximizing the score is to ensure that the smaller numbers are used as the minimum values in the pairs.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the list of numbers ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first.
   - By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element (starting from the first element), we are effectively pairing the smallest number with the next smallest number, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - It reads the value of n.
     - It reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
     - It initializes the score to 0.
     - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
     - It prints the final score for the current test case.

4. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - `for _ in range(int(input())):`: This loop runs for the number of test cases.
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the value of n for the current test case.
   - `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`: Reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
   - `score = 0`: Initializes the score to 0.
   - `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`: Iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element).
   - `score += l[i]`: Adds the current element to the score.
   - `print(score)`: Prints the final score for the current test case.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the list and taking every second element ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number in each pair to the score.
   - This strategy is optimal because it ensures that the smallest numbers are used first, which maximizes the score.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the correct score for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
