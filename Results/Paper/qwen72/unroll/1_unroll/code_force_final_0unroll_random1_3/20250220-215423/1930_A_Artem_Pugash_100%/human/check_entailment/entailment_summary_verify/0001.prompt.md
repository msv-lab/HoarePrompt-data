You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair of the sorted list. The function prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t` and the list of lists are not modified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing them.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number as the minimum value in each move.
   - Sorting the list of numbers ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first.
   - After sorting, we can pair the numbers in a way that the smallest number in each pair is added to the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the value of n.
     - Read the 2n integers and sort them.
     - Initialize the score to 0.
     - Iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
     - Print the score.

4. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - `for _ in range(int(input())):`: This loop runs for the number of test cases.
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the value of n for the current test case.
   - `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`: Reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
   - `score = 0`: Initializes the score to 0.
   - `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`: Iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element).
   - `score += l[i]`: Adds the current element to the score.
   - `print(score)`: Prints the final score for the current test case.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the list and taking every second element ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number in each pair to the score.
   - This strategy guarantees that we maximize the score because the smallest numbers are used first, which is optimal for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
