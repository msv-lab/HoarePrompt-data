The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair of the sorted list. The function prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t` and the list of lists are not modified.
