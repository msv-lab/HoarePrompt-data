Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for the numbers written on the whiteboard.**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
