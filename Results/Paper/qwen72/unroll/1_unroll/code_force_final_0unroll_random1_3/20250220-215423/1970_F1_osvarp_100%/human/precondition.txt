N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters, where each pair represents a cell on the field. The pairs can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" for a red team player, "B0" to "B9" for a blue team player, "RG" for a red goal, "BG" for a blue goal, and ".Q" for the Quaffle. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, and the actions are a list of T strings, each describing a valid action performed by an entity on the field.
