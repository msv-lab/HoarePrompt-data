Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which is a critical part of the problem description. According to the problem, if a player from the red team scores in a red goal, the blue team should win the point, and vice versa. However, the program only checks if the player is at a goal position and increments the score for the team corresponding to that goal, without considering whether the player is from the same team as the goal.

Let's break down the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal position using the `goalIn` function.
   - If the player is at a goal position, it prints the goal and increments the score for the team corresponding to that goal.

   ```python
   elif com == 'T':
       allPlayers[obj] = False
       if goalIn(pos) != -1:
           team = goalIn(pos)
           print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
           points[team] += 1
   ```

2. **Goal Identification**:
   - The `goalIn` function returns 0 if the position is in the red team's goal and 1 if the position is in the blue team's goal.

   ```python
   def goalIn(pos):
       res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
       return res
   ```

3. **Player Team Identification**:
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies whether a string represents a player.

   ```python
   def isPlayer(el):
       res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
       return res
   ```

However, the program lacks the logic to determine if the player is from the same team as the goal. This is a crucial oversight that leads to incorrect scoring. For example, in the third example provided:

- Input:
  ```
  3 5
  .. .. R0 .. ..
  RG .. .Q .. BG
  .. .. B0 .. ..
  5
  R0 D
  R0 C .Q
  R0 L
  R0 L
  R0 T
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  4 BLUE GOAL
  FINAL SCORE: 0 1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4 RED GOAL
  FINAL SCORE: 1 0
  ```

The red player `R0` scores in a red goal `RG`, but the program incorrectly increments the red team's score instead of the blue team's score.

To fix this, the program should include a check to determine if the player is from the same team as the goal. If they are, the other team should get the point.

Final: **False**
