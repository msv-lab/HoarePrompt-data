The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is expected to generate and return a value or values related to integers `n` and `m` where both are odd and within the range of 3 to 99, inclusive. However, since the specific output is not detailed, I can only infer that the function returns a result based on these constraints. 

Functionality: **The function generates and returns a value or values based on two predefined odd integers `n` and `m` within the range of 3 to 99.**
