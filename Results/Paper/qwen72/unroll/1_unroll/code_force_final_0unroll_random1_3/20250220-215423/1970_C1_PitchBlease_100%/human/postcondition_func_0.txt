The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs two breadth-first searches (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance from the `start` node to either of the first two leaves is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters.
