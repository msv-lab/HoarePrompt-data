#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and represents the edges of the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of all the nodes directly connected to it by an edge. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs two breadth-first searches (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance from the `start` node to either of the first two leaves is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters.
