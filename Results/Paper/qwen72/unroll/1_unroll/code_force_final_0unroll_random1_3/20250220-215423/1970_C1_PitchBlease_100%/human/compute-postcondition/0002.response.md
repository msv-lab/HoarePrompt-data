For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `while queue:` must be true. This means that the `queue` must not be empty. 

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start` <= n and 1 <= `target` <= n.
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.

The `queue` is already initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, which means it is not empty. Therefore, the loop condition `while queue:` is already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start` <= n and 1 <= `target` <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
