Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It will then print the sum of the maximum of the first `n-1` elements in `nums` and the last element in `nums`. The variables `a` and `n` from the initial state remain unchanged.**
