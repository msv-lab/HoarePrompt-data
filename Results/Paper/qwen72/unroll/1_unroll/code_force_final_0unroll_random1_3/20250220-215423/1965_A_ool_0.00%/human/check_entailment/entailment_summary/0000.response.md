Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the piles. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check for `arr[0] != 1`**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1` is incorrect because it only checks the first element of the list `arr`. This does not necessarily determine the outcome of the game. For example, if `arr` is `[1, 3, 5]`, Alice can still win by choosing `k=1` on her first turn, but the function will incorrectly return 'Alice' because `arr[0]` is 1.

2. **Handling Unique Elements**:
   - The function converts `arr` to a set, sorts it, and then checks for gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements. This approach is based on the idea that if there are no gaps greater than 1, the game can be determined by the parity of the number of unique elements. However, this is not a correct approach for the game described.
   - The game is more about the parity of the smallest pile and the total number of piles. If the smallest pile is odd, Alice can always win by removing an odd number of stones, ensuring that the smallest pile remains odd. If the smallest pile is even, Bob can always win by removing an even number of stones, ensuring that the smallest pile remains even.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to check the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile has an odd number of stones, Alice wins. If the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Bob wins.
   - This is because the game is essentially about reducing the smallest pile to zero. If the smallest pile is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of stones in the smallest pile for Bob, and vice versa.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the game logic based on the parity of the smallest pile.

Correctness: **False**
