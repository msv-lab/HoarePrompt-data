Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is False; the first element of `arr` is 1; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order; `not_c` is True.**

The code snippet sets the variable `not_c` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `not_c`.
