Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n still holds true, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
