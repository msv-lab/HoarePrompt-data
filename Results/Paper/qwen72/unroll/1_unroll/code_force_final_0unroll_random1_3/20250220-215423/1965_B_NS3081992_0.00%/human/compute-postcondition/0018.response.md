The value `2 * k + 1` is appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and now `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, `ans` is now a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.**
