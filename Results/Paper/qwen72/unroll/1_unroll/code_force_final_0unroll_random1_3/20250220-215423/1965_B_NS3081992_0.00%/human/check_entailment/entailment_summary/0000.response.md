### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the sequence based on the input values `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - `func_14()` reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then generates a sequence `ans` that meets the problem's conditions:
     - If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the sequence `1\n2`.
     - If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, it generates a sequence of powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - If `k` is not 1, it generates a sequence starting with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The sequence `ans` should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `ans` that sums to `v`.

4. **Analysis of `func_14()`**:
   - **Case 1: `k == 1` and `n == 2`**:
     - The sequence `1\n2` is returned, which is correct because it has a subsequence that sums to 1 (i.e., `[1]`) but not to 2.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1` and `n != 2`**:
     - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, ..., 2^(l-1)]` is generated. This sequence does not contain 1, and it can form all sums from 2 to `n` using the powers of 2.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1`**:
     - The sequence starts with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), ensuring that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
     - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the sum of the sequence up to `k-1` is exactly `k-1`.
     - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all sums greater than `k` can be formed.
     - The remaining powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1) are added to cover the remaining range up to `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - `func_15()` prints the sequence generated by `func_14()` for each test case, ensuring that the output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's conditions for all valid inputs. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
