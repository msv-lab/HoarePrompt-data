The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided output cases, it implicitly uses two integer values `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

**Case_1:** The function returns the string '1\n2'.

**Case_2:** The function returns a string containing the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. Otherwise, `ans` is a list that starts with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

Functionality: **The function implicitly uses two integer values `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. It returns a string. In Case_1, the string is '1\n2'. In Case_2, if `k` is 1, the string contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1) separated by spaces, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. Otherwise, the string contains a sequence of numbers starting with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
