Output State: **The program returns None.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is a return statement without any value specified, which means the program returns `None`. This is the default return value for functions in Python when no explicit value is returned. The initial state and the call to `func_2(0, 1)` do not affect this outcome since the return statement is empty.
