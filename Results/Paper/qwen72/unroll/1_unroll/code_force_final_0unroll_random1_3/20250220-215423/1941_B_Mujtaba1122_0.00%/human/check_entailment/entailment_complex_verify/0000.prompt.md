You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will either return False if any of the first n elements in the list are non-zero, or it will complete all iterations without returning if all the first n elements are zero. The list and n remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `list` and a non-negative integer `n` where 0 <= n <= len(list). It checks if all the first `n` elements in the list are zero. If any of these elements are non-zero, the function returns `False`. If all the first `n` elements are zero, the function returns `True`. The list and the value of `n` remain unchanged after the function call.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers with length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0, `list[i]` will be reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process will continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, will not be modified by the loop.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0, `list[i]` will be reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process will continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, will not be modified by the loop. Additionally, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function `func_1` has returned `True`. Otherwise, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function `func_1` has returned `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` is set to 0, `list[i]` is reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` is reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process continues for each `i` until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, are not modified. After the list is processed, the function calls `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. One issue is in the `func_2` function where the operation is being applied incorrectly. Specifically, the line:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

This logic is flawed because it is decrementing `list[i - 1]` by itself, which is not the intended operation. The operation should decrement `list[i - 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i + 1]` by 1. The correct implementation should be:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

Additionally, the program does not check if the array can be made all zeros in a more efficient way. For example, the program does not handle cases where the sum of the elements is not divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made all zeros.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly apply the operations and does not handle the necessary conditions for the array to be made all zeros.
