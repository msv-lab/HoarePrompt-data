Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves an array `a` of `n` integers, and the task is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation can be applied to any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1), which modifies three consecutive elements: `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by decrementing them by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(list, n)`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero and `True` if all elements are zero.
     - This function is correctly implemented and will work as intended.

   - **`func_2(list, n)`**:
     - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list in a loop.
     - The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-2` (i.e., 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).
     - Inside the loop, there is a `while` loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
     - The `while` loop is supposed to decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, until the conditions are no longer met.
     - However, the implementation of the `while` loop is incorrect. The current code:
       ```python
       list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
       list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       ```
       This code is decrementing `list[i-1]` by its own value, `list[i]` by twice its own value, and `list[i+1]` by its own value. This is not the intended operation, which should be:
       ```python
       list[i - 1] -= 1
       list[i] -= 2
       list[i + 1] -= 1
       ```

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it modifies the elements in a way that does not match the problem's operation.
   - The incorrect modification can lead to incorrect results, such as elements becoming negative or the operation not being applied correctly.
   - The `func_1` function is correct, but it relies on the output of `func_2`, which is flawed.

Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
