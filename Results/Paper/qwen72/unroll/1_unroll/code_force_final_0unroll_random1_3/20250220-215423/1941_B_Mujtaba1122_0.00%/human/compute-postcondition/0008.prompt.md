You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers with length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0, `list[i]` will be reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process will continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, will not be modified by the loop.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0, `list[i]` will be reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process will continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, will not be modified by the loop. Additionally, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function `func_1` has returned `True`. Otherwise, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function `func_1` has returned `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. If `n` is out of this range, it returns an error message. If `n` is within the range, it returns a processed result based on the list and `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
