The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` is set to 0, `list[i]` is reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` is reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process continues for each `i` until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, are not modified. After the list is processed, the function calls `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
