### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation that decreases `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1 for any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
   - If it completes the iteration without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its purpose.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array and then checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`.
   - The loop iterates over indices from 1 to `n-2` (i.e., 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - However, the operation is incorrect because it subtracts `list[i-1]` from the elements, which is not what the problem description specifies. The problem requires subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.

4. **Correct Operation**:
   - The correct operation should be:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1`
   - The current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect because it uses `list[i-1]` as the decrement value, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the array is already zero or where the initial conditions do not allow the operation to be applied (e.g., if `list[i]` is less than 2 or if `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` are zero).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because the operation inside `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description. The correct operation should subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.

**Correctness: False**
