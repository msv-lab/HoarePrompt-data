Reasoning:  
The function `func` is intended to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` and checking several conditions to print "Yes" or "No".

Let's break down the conditions and their correctness:

1. **`if n == m:`**  
   - This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If `n` is equal to `m`, it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes by simply adding a cube in each move. This condition is correct.

2. **`elif m > n:`**  
   - This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes because Nikita can only perform `n` moves. This condition is correct.

3. **`elif m == n - 1:`**  
   - This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`. If `m` is `n - 1`, it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes by adding a cube in `m` moves and then removing one cube in the last move. This condition is correct.

4. **`elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`**  
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If both `m` and `n` are even, it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves and the number of cubes must match for it to be possible. This condition is correct.

5. **`elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`**  
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Similar to the previous condition, if both `m` and `n` are odd, it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

6. **`else:`**  
   - This condition covers all other cases where the above conditions do not hold. If the parity of `m` and `n` does not match, it is impossible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

However, there is a logical issue in the program. The conditions are not exhaustive, and there is a missing case where `m` is less than `n` but not equal to `n - 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, the program will incorrectly print "No" because none of the conditions are met. The correct approach should be to check if `n` is at least `m` and if the parity of `n` and `m` matches, which can be simplified to:

```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which means that the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced to achieve exactly `m` cubes.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
