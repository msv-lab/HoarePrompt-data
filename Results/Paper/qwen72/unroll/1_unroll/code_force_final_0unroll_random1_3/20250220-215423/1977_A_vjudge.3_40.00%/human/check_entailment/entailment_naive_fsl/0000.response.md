Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( n \) is even and \( m \) is odd, or vice versa, but \( n \geq m \) and \( n - m \) is even. For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( m = 4 \), the program should output "Yes" because Nikita can perform 4 moves to add 4 cubes and then 2 moves to remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower of 4 cubes. However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" in this case.
