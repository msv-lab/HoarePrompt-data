The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `arr` is at least 1. The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches -1. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` must be set to the last index of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
