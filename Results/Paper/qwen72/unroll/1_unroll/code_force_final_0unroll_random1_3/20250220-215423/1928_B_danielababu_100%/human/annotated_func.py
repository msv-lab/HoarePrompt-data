#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer, which is the result of the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are used in the function signature.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element of the input (split by spaces) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element of the user input (split by spaces) into an integer. After the function concludes, the program has an iterator that can be used to access the integer values from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input provided by the user, where the input is split into separate strings and each string is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_4.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were input by the user, where the integers are separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of integers, and returns a sorted list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a sorted list of integers that were input by the user, where the integers are separated by spaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function takes no arguments. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to contain space-separated strings that can be converted to integers.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is the result of converting a space-separated integer input from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns an iterator that yields each integer converted to a string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard input has been consumed, and the function has returned an iterator of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from an input string provided by the user. After the function concludes, the user will have a list where each element is a character from the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of strings that can be converted to integers.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the space-separated list provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, sorts the integers in ascending order, and returns a list of the sorted integers as strings. The function does not modify any external variables and operates solely on the input provided. After the function concludes, the returned list contains the sorted string representations of the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the product of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element is the product of the first `i+1` elements of the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and returns a new list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving backwards, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving backwards.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving backwards. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
