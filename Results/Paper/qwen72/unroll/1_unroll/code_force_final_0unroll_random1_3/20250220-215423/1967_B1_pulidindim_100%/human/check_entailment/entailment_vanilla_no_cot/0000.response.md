Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs is not simply `n`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `m`, but the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The variable `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, but this is not used correctly in the logic.
   - The variable `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`, but this does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs.
   - The expression `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` are not logically sound for the problem.

3. **Break Condition**:
   - The break condition `if g < countmins` is not appropriate for the problem.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is simply `ans` after the loop, which is not the correct count of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using a more systematic approach, such as:

1. **Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\)**.
2. **For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\)**.
3. **Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)**.
4. **Count the number of valid pairs**.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and number theory to reduce the complexity.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a more efficient approach using number theory:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This solution iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition, but it is still not the most efficient. For large values of \(n\) and \(m\), a more optimized approach using properties of GCD and divisors would be necessary.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
