Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a loop, and prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `n` and `m` are no longer relevant, and the variable `t` will have been decremented to 0. **
