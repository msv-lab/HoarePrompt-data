Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` in reverse order.** 

To clarify, if `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is constructed by calculating the product of all elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first, with each element in `ans` representing the product of all elements in `arr` from that position to the end. The variable `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, but it is not returned by the program.
