Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions in the program are not designed to handle the specific requirements of the problem, such as finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. The functions provided are mostly for reading input and do not contain the logic necessary to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_8` and `func_9` are computing the product of elements in the array, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
