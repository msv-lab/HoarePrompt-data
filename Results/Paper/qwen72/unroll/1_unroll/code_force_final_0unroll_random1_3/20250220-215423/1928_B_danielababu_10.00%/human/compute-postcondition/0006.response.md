The function `func_9` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. The function returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
