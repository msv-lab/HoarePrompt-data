#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has obtained an integer input from the user and returned this value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, which is expected to be a sequence of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the sequence of integers input by the user, where each integer is converted from a string to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a map object that can be iterated over to access the sequence of integers provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from a space-separated string input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the user input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from the input string. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function is expected to read input that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, sorts the list, and returns the sorted list. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user receives a sorted list of integers that were provided as input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the string representations of the input values split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing the string representations of the input values provided by the user, split by whitespace. The map object is generated by applying the `str` function to each element of the list produced by splitting the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts no parameters and returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user. The input string is unspecified and is taken from the user during the function's execution. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list of characters derived from the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_7` does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where the strings are the input values split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and returns a sorted list of strings. These strings are derived from the input provided by the user, which is split by spaces. The function affects the user input by converting it into a list of strings and sorting this list before returning it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer is greater than 0.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`. Each element in `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` up to that point.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is greater than 0. It returns a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to that point. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` in reverse order, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, calculated in reverse order. After the function concludes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products starting from the last element of `arr` to the first.
