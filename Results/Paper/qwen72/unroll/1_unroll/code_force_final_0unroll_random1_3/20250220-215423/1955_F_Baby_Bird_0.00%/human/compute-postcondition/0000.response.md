For the given task, the state before the loop starts is:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`.
2. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. The state of `t` and `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is:

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
