Output State: **For each test case, the output is an integer that is the sum of the number of odd integers in the first three elements of the list `p` (which can only be 0 or 3) and half the sum of all elements in the list `p` (rounded down). The initial state of `t` and the lists `p_i` remain unchanged.**
