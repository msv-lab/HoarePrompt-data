You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: `custos` is a list of integers where each integer represents the minimum cost calculated for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The length of `custos` is equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The loop prints each integer in the list `custos` exactly once, in the order they appear in the list. The list `custos` itself remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the `a` and `b` values and appends them to `a_values` and `b_values` lists, respectively.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue (position `n-1`) to the position `m-1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`. If true, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`. Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Additional Cost Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates from position `m-1` to the beginning of the queue (position `1`) in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if the sum of `a_values[y-1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If true, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo` and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` to the total cost `custo` and breaks the loop.
   - If the condition is false, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost `custo` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - After calculating the cost for each test case, it appends the cost to the `custos` list.
   - Finally, it prints each cost in the `custos` list for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
  - The logic for calculating the cost is based on the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for positions greater than `m-1`, which is correct.
  - For positions less than `m-1`, the program checks if the sum of the cost to move to the previous position and the cost to move to the current position is less than or equal to the cost to move directly to the current position. This logic is also correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is 1 correctly by ensuring that the cost to move to the first position is added.
  - The program also handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will not enter the second loop and will only add the cost to move to the first position if necessary.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it iterates through the lists in a linear manner, which is O(n) for each test case.
  - The space complexity is also reasonable, as it uses additional lists to store the input values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
