### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the lists `a_values` and `b_values` from the input and converts them to integers.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The first loop iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position, adding the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the specific rules of the problem. Kirill can only move to a position `j` where `j < i` and pay `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The second loop attempts to adjust the cost further, but it does not correctly implement the logic for moving Kirill to the desired position.
   - The condition `if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not aligned with the problem's rules. Kirill should be able to move to any position `j` where `j < i` and pay the corresponding costs, not just the immediate previous position.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve a more dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - Kirill should consider all possible positions `j` where `j < i` and calculate the total cost for each move, then choose the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to account for the specific rules of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions and the associated costs.

Correctness: **False**
