### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the `a` and `b` values and appends them to `a_values` and `b_values` lists, respectively.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue (position `n-1`) to the position `m-1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`. If true, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`. Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Additional Cost Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates from position `m-1` to the beginning of the queue (position `1`) in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if the sum of `a_values[y-1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If true, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo` and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` to the total cost `custo` and breaks the loop.
   - If the condition is false, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost `custo` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - After calculating the cost for each test case, it appends the cost to the `custos` list.
   - Finally, it prints each cost in the `custos` list for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
  - The logic for calculating the cost is based on the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for positions greater than `m-1`, which is correct.
  - For positions less than `m-1`, the program checks if the sum of the cost to move to the previous position and the cost to move to the current position is less than or equal to the cost to move directly to the current position. This logic is also correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is 1 correctly by ensuring that the cost to move to the first position is added.
  - The program also handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will not enter the second loop and will only add the cost to move to the first position if necessary.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it iterates through the lists in a linear manner, which is O(n) for each test case.
  - The space complexity is also reasonable, as it uses additional lists to store the input values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
