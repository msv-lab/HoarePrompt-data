The only object in the loop head is the list `custos`, and the variable `c` which will take the values from `custos` during each iteration. For the loop to execute, `custos` must contain at least one element. The state of `c` is not defined before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the value of each element in `custos` during the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `custos` is a list of integers.
- The length of `custos` is equal to `x`.

To ensure the loop executes, `custos` must have at least one element, which means `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `c` will be the first element of `custos` when the loop starts.

State: **`custos` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `custos`, `x` is greater than 0**
