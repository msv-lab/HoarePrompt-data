The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state before the loop do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `custos` is an empty list**
