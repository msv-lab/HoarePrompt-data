The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves reading an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. The values of `t` and `a` are unchanged after the function concludes, and the list `b` is redefined for each test case.
