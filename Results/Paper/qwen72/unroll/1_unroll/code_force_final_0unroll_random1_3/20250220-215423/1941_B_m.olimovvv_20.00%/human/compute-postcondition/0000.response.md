To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` will be `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since `t` is the number of test cases and the loop will run `t` times)
- `_` is 0 (the loop variable, but it is not used in the loop body)

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `_` is 0**
