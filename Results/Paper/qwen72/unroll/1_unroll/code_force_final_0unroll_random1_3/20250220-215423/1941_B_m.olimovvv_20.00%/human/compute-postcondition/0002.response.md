The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, each with a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
