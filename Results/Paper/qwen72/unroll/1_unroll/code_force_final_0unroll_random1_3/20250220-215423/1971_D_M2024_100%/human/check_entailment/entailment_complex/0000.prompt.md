Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= |s| <= 500, and return an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged, and `s` remains the same string consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The loop prints a number for each iteration based on the input string `a` provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `a` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= |a| <= 500). The function calculates and prints the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string `a` into a sorted binary string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the value of `t` is unchanged, and the input strings `a` remain the same.
