The function `func` accepts a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where the length of `s` is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The function returns an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It returns an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.**
