The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= |s| <= 500, and return an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
