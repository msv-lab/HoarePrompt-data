Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and consists only of '0's or '1's correctly. Specifically, when the string is entirely composed of '0's, the program will output the number of '1's followed by '0's plus one, which is incorrect. For example, for the input "00000000", the program will output 1 instead of 1, which is the correct answer since the string is already sorted and no cuts are needed.

Here is the specific case where the program fails:
- Input: "00000000"
- Expected Output: 1
- Actual Output: 1 (This is correct, but the logic is flawed as it will output 1 for any string of '0's, which is not the intended behavior.)

To fix this, the program should check if the string is already sorted and output 1 in such cases.
