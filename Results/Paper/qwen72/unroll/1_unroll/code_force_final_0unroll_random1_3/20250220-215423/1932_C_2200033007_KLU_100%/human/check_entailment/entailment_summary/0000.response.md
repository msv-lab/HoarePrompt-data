Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Array and String Processing**: The function `func_1` initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively. It then iterates over the string `s`, appending elements to the list `b` based on whether the current command is 'L' or 'R'. This correctly simulates the removal of elements from the array `a` as described in the problem.

3. **Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the modulo `m` at each step. This is done to ensure that the product does not overflow and to correctly compute the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` at each step.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results of each test case as a space-separated list of integers, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when all commands are 'L' or 'R'. For example, in the case where `n` is 1, the function will append the single element to `b` and then return the product of that single element modulo `m`.

6. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it processes each test case in O(n) time, which is suitable given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
