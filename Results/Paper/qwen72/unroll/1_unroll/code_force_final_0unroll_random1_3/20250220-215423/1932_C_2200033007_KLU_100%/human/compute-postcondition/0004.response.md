Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^4, `l` is n, `r` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, once for each element in the list `a`.
- If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is 'L', the loop appends the element at index `l` from list `a` to list `b` and then increments `l` by 1.
- If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is 'R', the loop appends the element at index `r` from list `a` to list `b` and then decrements `r` by 1.
- After `n` iterations, `b` will contain `n` elements, and `l` will be `n` (since it starts at 0 and is incremented `n` times), and `r` will be `-1` (since it starts at `n-1` and is decremented `n` times).
