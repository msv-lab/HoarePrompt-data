### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that will be removed from `a` in the order of commands.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they were removed.

3. **Product Calculation and Modulo Operation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and takes the result modulo `m`.
     - It appends the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results of each test case as required.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Parsing and Function Call:**
  - The input parsing and function call are correct. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.

- **Correctness of Command Processing:**
  - The command processing logic is correct. The elements are removed from `a` in the order specified by `s`, and the removed elements are stored in `b`.

- **Correctness of Product Calculation and Modulo Operation:**
  - The product calculation and modulo operation are correct. The program correctly computes the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` for each command.
  - The use of `reversed(b)` ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, from the last removed element to the first.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as a single element array and a single command correctly.
  - The constraints are respected, and the program should handle the maximum input sizes efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
