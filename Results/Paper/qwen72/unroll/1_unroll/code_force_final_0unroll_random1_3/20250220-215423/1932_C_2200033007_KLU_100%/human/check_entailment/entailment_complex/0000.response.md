### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements removed from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, `b` contains the elements removed from `a` in the order they were removed.

3. **Product Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the cumulative product.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v`, modulo `m`.
     - It appends the result of `p` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results of each test case as required.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly processes the commands and updates the array `a` accordingly.
- The product calculation and modulo operation are performed correctly.
- The order of the results is maintained as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
