You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `m` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by iterating over `s` and appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by 'L' or 'R'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, and the returned list contains the cumulative product of these integers, modulo `m`, in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainder:**
   - The program initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m`.
     - It appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the elements at the beginning of each command execution.
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes the commands and updates the array `a` by removing elements from either the left or the right.
- The product of the elements is calculated modulo `m` at each step, and the results are stored and printed in the correct order.
- The use of `reversed` in the final step ensures that the remainders are printed in the order they were calculated, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
