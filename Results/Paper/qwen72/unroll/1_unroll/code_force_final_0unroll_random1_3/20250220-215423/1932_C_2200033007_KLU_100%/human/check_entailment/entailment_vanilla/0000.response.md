### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainder:**
   - The program initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m`.
     - It appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the elements at the beginning of each command execution.
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes the commands and updates the array `a` by removing elements from either the left or the right.
- The product of the elements is calculated modulo `m` at each step, and the results are stored and printed in the correct order.
- The use of `reversed` in the final step ensures that the remainders are printed in the order they were calculated, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
