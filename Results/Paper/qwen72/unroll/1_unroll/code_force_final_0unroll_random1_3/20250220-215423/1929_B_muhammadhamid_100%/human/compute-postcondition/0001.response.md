Output State: **The loop will execute for each pair of inputs (n, k) provided. For each pair, if k is 1, the output will be 1. If k is between 2 and 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output will be the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output will be k divided by 2, rounded down, plus 1. The loop will continue to execute until all input pairs have been processed.**
