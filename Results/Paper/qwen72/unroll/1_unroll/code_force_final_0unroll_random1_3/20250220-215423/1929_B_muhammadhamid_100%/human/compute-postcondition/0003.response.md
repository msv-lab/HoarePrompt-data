Functionality: ** The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through user input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. For each pair, it outputs the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition. If `k` is 1, the output is 1. If `k` is between 2 and 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2. If `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output is `k` divided by 2, rounded down, plus 1. The function continues processing until all input pairs have been handled. **
