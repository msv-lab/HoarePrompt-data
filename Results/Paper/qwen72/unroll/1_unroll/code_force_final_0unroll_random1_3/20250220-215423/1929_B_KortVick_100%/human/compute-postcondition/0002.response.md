Output State: **The function `func` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop iterates `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and prints the result of the condition check. After the loop, the values of `n` and `k` are the last values read from the input, and `t` is unchanged.**
