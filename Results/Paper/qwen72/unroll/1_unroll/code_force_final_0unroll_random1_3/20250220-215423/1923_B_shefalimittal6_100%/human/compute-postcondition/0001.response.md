Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, `x` is a list of integers where -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0, `k` is an integer where 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9, `n` is equal to the length of `a`, and `len(a) == len(x)`. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1, sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))` creates a new list `sorted_indices` that contains the indices of the elements in `x`, sorted based on the absolute values of those elements.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The length of `sorted_indices` is `n`, and it contains the indices from 0 to n-1, but in a different order based on the sorting criteria.
