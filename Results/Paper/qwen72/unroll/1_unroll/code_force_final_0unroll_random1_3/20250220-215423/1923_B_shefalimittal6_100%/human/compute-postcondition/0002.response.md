Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, `x` is a list of integers where -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0, `k` is an integer where 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9, `n` is equal to the length of `a`, `len(a) == len(x)`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1, sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `distance` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
