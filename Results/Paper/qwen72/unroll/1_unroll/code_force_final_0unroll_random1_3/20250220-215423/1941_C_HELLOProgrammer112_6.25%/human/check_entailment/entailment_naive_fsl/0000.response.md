Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them to determine the number of deletions needed. However, this approach does not consider the positions of these substrings or the possibility of overlapping occurrences, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Example of incorrect behavior:**

Consider the input string "mappie":
- The program will count "map" once and "pie" once, leading to a total of 2 deletions.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we can actually remove just 1 character (the 'p' between "map" and "pie"), resulting in "maie", which does not contain either "map" or "pie".

Thus, the program does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
