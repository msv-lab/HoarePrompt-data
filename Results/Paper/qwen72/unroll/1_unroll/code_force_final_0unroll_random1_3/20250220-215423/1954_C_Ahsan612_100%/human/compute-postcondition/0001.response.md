Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints two lines. The first line is the lexicographically largest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the maximum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the minimum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The second line is the lexicographically smallest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the minimum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the maximum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The variables t, x, and y remain unchanged.**
