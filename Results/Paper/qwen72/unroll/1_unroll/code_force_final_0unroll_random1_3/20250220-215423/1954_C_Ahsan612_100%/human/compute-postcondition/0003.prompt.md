You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints two lines. The first line is the lexicographically largest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the maximum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the minimum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The second line is the lexicographically smallest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the minimum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the maximum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The variables t, x, and y remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters as per the provided signature. However, based on the constraints, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
