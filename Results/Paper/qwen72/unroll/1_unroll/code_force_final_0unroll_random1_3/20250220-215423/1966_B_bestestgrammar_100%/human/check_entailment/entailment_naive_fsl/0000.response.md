Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the possibility of making all squares in the grid the same color when the grid has a more complex configuration of 'W' and 'B' that does not align with the specific checks it performs.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```

In this grid, the corners (0,0) and (2,2) are both 'W', and the program will not mark this as impossible because it only checks the corners and the edges for uniformity. However, it is impossible to make all squares in this grid the same color using the allowed operations. The program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case.

The program only checks if the corners and the edges are uniform, but it does not consider the entire grid. A correct solution would need to check if there is any way to make the entire grid uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the subrectangle between them.
