You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is now 0, as the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are no longer in scope, as they are defined within the loop and are reset for each test case. The output for each test case is printed as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the grid. The function then checks if it is possible to transform the grid so that the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color by only changing the colors of the cells on the borders. If it is possible, the function prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the output for each test case is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the possibility of making all squares in the grid the same color when the grid has a more complex configuration of 'W' and 'B' that does not align with the specific checks it performs.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```

In this grid, the corners (0,0) and (2,2) are both 'W', and the program will not mark this as impossible because it only checks the corners and the edges for uniformity. However, it is impossible to make all squares in this grid the same color using the allowed operations. The program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case.

The program only checks if the corners and the edges are uniform, but it does not consider the entire grid. A correct solution would need to check if there is any way to make the entire grid uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the subrectangle between them.
