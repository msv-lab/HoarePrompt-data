You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from user input. The function then calculates and prints the largest integer divisor of `x` such that `(x - n * divisor)` is divisible by the divisor and non-negative. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^3, and `x` and `n` are unchanged for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the difficulties of the sub-problems are all multiples of some integer \( d \), then \( d \) must divide \( x \) (i.e., \( x \) is a multiple of \( d \)).
   - Additionally, \( d \) must divide \( x - n \cdot d \) (i.e., \( x - n \cdot d \) must be non-negative and a multiple of \( d \)).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( x - n \cdot i \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( i \). If so, \( i \) is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( x // i \). If so, \( x // i \) is another valid candidate for the GCD.
   - The maximum of these valid candidates is stored in `ans`.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( n \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the maximum GCD found.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 1 \) correctly, as the GCD of a single number is the number itself.
   - The program also handles the case where \( x \) is a prime number, as the only valid GCD in such cases would be 1.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is efficient for the given constraints \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating over possible divisors and checking the conditions. It handles all edge cases and is efficient within the given constraints.
