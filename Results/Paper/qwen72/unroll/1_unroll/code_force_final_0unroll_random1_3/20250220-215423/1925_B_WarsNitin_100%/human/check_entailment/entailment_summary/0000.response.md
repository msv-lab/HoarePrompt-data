### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is maximized when the difficulties of the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible, which means they should be multiples of the GCD.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The function iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, `i` is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks the complementary divisor `x // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.
   - The maximum valid divisor is stored in `ans` and printed for each test case.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Divisors**: The function correctly iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and checks both `i` and `x // i`.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `x % i == 0` ensures `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - `x - n * i >= 0` ensures that the sum of `n` sub-problems with difficulty `i` does not exceed `x`.
     - `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the sub-problems.
     - The same conditions are checked for `x // i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only valid sub-problem difficulty is 1, which is correctly handled by the function.
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the function correctly identifies 2 as the maximum GCD.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the function correctly identifies 6 as the maximum GCD.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The function is efficient as it only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for divisor-related problems.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`. It handles all edge cases and efficiently finds the solution.
