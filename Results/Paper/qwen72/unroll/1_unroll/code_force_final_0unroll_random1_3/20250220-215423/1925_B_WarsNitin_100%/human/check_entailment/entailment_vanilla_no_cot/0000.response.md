Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems, ensuring that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and that there are exactly `n` sub-problems. The logic checks if `i` and `x // i` can be valid GCDs and updates the answer accordingly. This approach is efficient and handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
