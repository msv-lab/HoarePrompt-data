Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array`. It then generates a string `ans` by mapping each element in `array` to a corresponding character from a predefined alphabet list `alp`, based on the count of that element in the reversed `array`. The function prints the generated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` are reset for each test case, and `i` will be equal to `t` (the number of test cases) at the end. **
