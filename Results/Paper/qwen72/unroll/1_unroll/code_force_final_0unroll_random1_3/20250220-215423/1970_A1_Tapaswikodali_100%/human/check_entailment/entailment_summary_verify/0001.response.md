### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on the balance and position, and then constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(infoA, infoB)` is a comparison function used to sort the balance information.
   - It returns `infoA.balance - infoB.balance` if the balances are different, ensuring that the sorting is primarily based on the balance in increasing order.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns `infoB.position - infoA.position`, ensuring that the sorting is based on the position in decreasing order.
   - This function is correct for the purpose of sorting the balance information as described in the problem.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and for each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, position, and character.
   - The balance is updated based on whether the character is an opening parenthesis '(' (incrementing the balance) or a closing parenthesis ')' (decrementing the balance).
   - After collecting all the balance information, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the key `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`, which matches the sorting criteria described in the problem.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly computes the balance for each prefix and stores the balance information along with the position and character.
   - The sorting is done according to the specified criteria.
   - The result is constructed by joining the characters in the sorted order.
   - The program handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program does not return the result string but prints it directly, which is consistent with the problem statement.
- The program assumes that the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.
- The use of a `BalanceInfo` class is implied but not explicitly defined in the provided code. However, the lambda function used for sorting suggests that `BalanceInfo` has attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

Final: **True**
