You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:

    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB`. Since `infoA.balance` is not equal to `infoB.balance`, the returned value is a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, each of which is an object with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are not equal, the function returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance`, which is a non-zero integer. If the `balance` attributes are equal, the function returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer. The function does not modify the input objects.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `balance` is 0, `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance value, the index `i`, and the character `s[i]` at that index, and the length of `balance_info` is `n`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - Since `result` is a string composed of the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the sorted `balance_info` list, the output will be the concatenation of these characters in the order they appear in the sorted list.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the sorted `balance_info` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return a value but instead prints a string `result` which is a rearranged version of the input string `s` based on the balance of parentheses. The `result` string is formed by sorting the characters of `s` in a specific order (first by balance, then by position in reverse) and concatenating them. The function does not modify the input string `s`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It maintains a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each storing the balance, position, and character of the input string. The balance is computed as the program iterates through the string, and the list is then sorted according to the rules specified: by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties. Finally, the characters are concatenated in the sorted order to form the balanced shuffle of the input string. This approach ensures that the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence that meets the problem's requirements for every potential input.
