You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB`. Since `infoA.balance` is not equal to `infoB.balance`, the returned value is a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.

    return infoB.position - infoA.position

    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))

    print(result)
    #This is printed: - Since `result` is a string composed of the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the sorted `balance_info` list, the output will be the concatenation of these characters in the order they appear in the sorted list.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the sorted `balance_info` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on the balance and position, and then constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(infoA, infoB)` is a comparison function that is used to sort the balance information.
   - It returns `infoA.balance - infoB.balance` if the balances are different, ensuring that the sorting is primarily based on the balance in increasing order.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns `infoB.position - infoA.position`, ensuring that the sorting is based on the position in decreasing order.
   - This function is correct for the purpose of sorting the balance information as described in the problem.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and for each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, position, and character.
   - The balance is updated based on whether the character is an opening parenthesis '(' (incrementing the balance) or a closing parenthesis ')' (decrementing the balance).
   - After collecting all the balance information, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the key `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`, which matches the sorting criteria described in the problem.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly computes the balance for each prefix and stores the balance information along with the position and character.
   - The sorting is done according to the specified criteria.
   - The result is constructed by joining the characters in the sorted order.
   - The program handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
