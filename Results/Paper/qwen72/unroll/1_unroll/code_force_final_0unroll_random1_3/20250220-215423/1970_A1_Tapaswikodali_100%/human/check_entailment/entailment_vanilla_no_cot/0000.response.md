Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is not directly used in the program but seems to be a comparison function that could be used for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance. If the balances are different, it sorts by balance in ascending order. If the balances are the same, it sorts by position in descending order. This is consistent with the problem's requirement for sorting.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function takes a string `s` as input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character in the string.
   - It iterates through the string, maintaining a running balance. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - After collecting all balance information, it sorts the `balance_info` list using a lambda function that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order, which matches the problem's sorting criteria.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters in the sorted order and prints it.

The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.
