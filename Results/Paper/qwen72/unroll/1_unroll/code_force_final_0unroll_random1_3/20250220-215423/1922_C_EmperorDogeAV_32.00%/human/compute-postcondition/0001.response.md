The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and the list `cities`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and `n` is already given as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, which ensures the loop will execute. The list `cities` is already defined as a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, so no adjustment is needed for `cities`.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0**
