### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` with extreme values to handle boundary conditions.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` to the previous city and `forward` to the next city.
   - It then compares the distances to the previous and next cities and assigns the cost to `prog_cities[i]` based on the minimum distance.
   - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it assigns 1 (indicating the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin).
   - Otherwise, it assigns the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city.

2. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - For the first city (`i = 0`), `back` is set to `-99999999`, which ensures that the distance to the previous city is always greater than the distance to the next city.
   - For the last city (`i = n-1`), `forward` is set to `99999999`, which ensures that the distance to the next city is always greater than the distance to the previous city.
   - These boundary conditions are correctly handled.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city in the list.
   - However, the cost assignment is flawed. It should assign the minimum distance to the closest city, not a fixed value of 1 when the next city is closer.
   - The correct logic should be:
     ```python
     if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
         prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
     else:
         prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
     ```
   - This ensures that the cost to travel to the closest city is the minimum distance to either the next or previous city.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - These prefix sums are used to efficiently answer the queries.

5. **Query Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the queries by using the prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost of traveling from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the cost of traveling to the closest city. It incorrectly assigns a fixed value of 1 when the next city is closer, which is not always the correct cost according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
