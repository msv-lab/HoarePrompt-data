Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the scenario where the closest city is determined uniquely for each city. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city, but it incorrectly handles the calculation of the closest city's cost. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only considers the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`) in the list, and it incorrectly assigns a fixed value of 1 to the cost of traveling to the closest city, which is not always correct.

For example, consider the cities located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. The closest city to city 1 (at point 0) is city 2 (at point 8), and the cost should be the absolute difference between the coordinates, which is 8. However, the program incorrectly assigns a cost of 1 to this travel, which is not correct according to the problem description.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are at the boundaries of the list. For instance, for the first city, there is no previous city to consider, and for the last city, there is no next city to consider. The program should handle these edge cases appropriately.

To correct this, the function `func_1` should correctly calculate the distance to the closest city and store the minimum of these distances. The program should also correctly handle the boundary conditions for the first and last cities.
