Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.** 

The initial state remains unchanged, except that a new list `prog_cities` has been created with a length of `n-1`, and all its elements are initialized to 0.
