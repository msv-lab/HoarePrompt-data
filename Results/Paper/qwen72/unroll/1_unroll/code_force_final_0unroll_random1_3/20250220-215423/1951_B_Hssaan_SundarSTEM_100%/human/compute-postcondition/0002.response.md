The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` and an integer `k`. The list `ratings` contains `n` distinct integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= n`. The integer `k` is the 1-based index of your cow in the list `ratings`. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

The function returns the number of cows with a higher rating than your cow, based on the given `ratings` list and the index `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `ratings` and an integer `k`, and returns the number of cows with a higher rating than the cow at index `k` in the `ratings` list.**
