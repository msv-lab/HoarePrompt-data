You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The list `ratings` contains `n` distinct integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= n`. The integer `k` is the index (1-based) of your cow in the list `ratings`. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

The list `ratings` and the index `k` will not be modified after the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a list of `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a series of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (index `k-1`) with any other cow once, or choose not to swap.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of matches our cow can win.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It reads the ratings of the cows into a list `s`.
   - The program then performs two main steps:
     1. **Initial Swap and Calculation:**
        - It swaps the rating of the cow at position 0 with our cow's rating.
        - It calculates the number of matches our cow can win starting from position 0.
        - It stores this count in `ans`.
     2. **Optimal Swap and Calculation:**
        - It restores the original list by swapping back.
        - It finds the position `p` where our cow would lose if it were in position 0.
        - It swaps our cow's rating with the cow at position `p`.
        - It calculates the number of matches our cow can win starting from position `p`.
        - It stores this count in `ans1`.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initial Swap and Calculation:**
     - The program swaps the rating of the cow at position 0 with our cow's rating.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0 and `h` to the rating of the cow at position 0 (which is now our cow's rating).
     - It iterates through the list starting from position 1, counting the number of matches our cow can win.
     - If our cow loses a match, it breaks the loop and stores the number of wins in `ans`.

   - **Optimal Swap and Calculation:**
     - The program restores the original list by swapping back.
     - It initializes `ans1` to 0 and `z` to 0.
     - It finds the position `p` where our cow would lose if it were in position 0.
     - It swaps our cow's rating with the cow at position `p`.
     - It iterates through the list again, counting the number of matches our cow can win starting from position `p`.
     - If our cow loses a match, it breaks the loop and stores the number of wins in `ans1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1` for each test case.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that swapping our cow to position 0 and then finding the optimal position `p` will always give the correct result.
   - However, the logic for finding `p` and the subsequent counting of wins is not entirely clear and may not cover all edge cases.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program's logic for swapping and counting wins is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios.
   - For example, if our cow's rating is the highest, it should always win all matches, but the program may not correctly handle this case.
   - Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of swapping our cow to other positions that might yield more wins.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may not always produce the correct result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
