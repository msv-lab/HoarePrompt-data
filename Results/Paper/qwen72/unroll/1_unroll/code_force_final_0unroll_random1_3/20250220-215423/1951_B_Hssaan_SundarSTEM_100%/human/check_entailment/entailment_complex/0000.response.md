### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index `k` of your cow.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `s`.

2. **Initial Swap:**
   - The function swaps the rating of your cow (at index `k-1`) with the rating of the first cow (at index `0`).
   - This is done to simulate the scenario where your cow is placed at the beginning of the list.

3. **First Simulation:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of matches your cow wins.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the first cow (now your cow's rating).
   - It iterates through the list starting from the second cow, incrementing `ans` for each match your cow wins (i.e., if `h` is greater than or equal to the current cow's rating).
   - The loop breaks when your cow loses a match.
   - The index `p` is set to the position where your cow loses the match.

4. **Revert Swap:**
   - The function reverts the initial swap to restore the original list.

5. **Optimal Swap:**
   - The function swaps your cow's rating with the rating at position `p` (the position where your cow lost in the first simulation).
   - This is done to simulate the scenario where your cow is placed just before the first cow that is stronger than it.

6. **Second Simulation:**
   - The function initializes `ans1` to 0, which will count the number of matches your cow wins in the second simulation.
   - It sets `z` to 0, which is a flag to indicate if your cow has been encountered.
   - It iterates through the list, incrementing `ans1` for each match your cow wins.
   - The loop breaks when your cow loses a match.
   - The flag `z` is set to 1 when your cow is encountered, and `ans1` is incremented if your cow wins the first match.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`, which represents the maximum number of matches your cow can win in the optimal scenario.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes multiple test cases.
- The initial swap and the first simulation correctly determine the number of matches your cow can win if placed at the beginning.
- The second swap and the second simulation correctly determine the number of matches your cow can win if placed just before the first cow that is stronger than it.
- The function prints the maximum number of wins, which is the correct output for the problem.
