The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of distinct integer ratings for cows and an index `k` (1-based) representing the position of your cow in the list. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before your cow such that all these cows have a rating less than or equal to your cow's rating. The function does not modify the input list `ratings` or the index `k` after processing each test case.
