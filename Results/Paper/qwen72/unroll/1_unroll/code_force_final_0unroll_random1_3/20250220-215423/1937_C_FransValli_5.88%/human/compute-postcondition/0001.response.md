Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the variables `k` and `best` have been updated to the indices of the elements in the hidden permutation `p` such that `p[k]` is the largest element and `p[best]` is the second largest element in the permutation. The final output for each test case is in the format `! k best`, where `k` and `best` are the indices of the largest and second largest elements, respectively.**
