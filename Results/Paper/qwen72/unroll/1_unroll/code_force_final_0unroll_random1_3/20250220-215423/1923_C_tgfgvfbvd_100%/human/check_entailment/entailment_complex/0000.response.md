### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n` integers.
   - The function constructs two auxiliary lists `p` and `c`:
     - `p` is a prefix sum array, which stores the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
     - `c` is a prefix count array, which stores the cumulative count of 1s in `l`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the function calculates:
     - `i` as the count of 1s in the subarray `l[a:b+1]`.
     - `s` as the sum of elements in the subarray `l[a:b+1]`.
   - The function checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus its length is at least the count of 1s in the subarray.

3. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is derived from the requirement that there exists a corresponding array `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in `a`.
     - No element in `b` equals the corresponding element in `a`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.
   - If the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus its length is at least the count of 1s, it means we can construct `b` by incrementing each element in `a` that is not 1 by 1, and setting each 1 to 2. This ensures that `b` is different from `a` and all elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, as it will print 'NO' in such cases.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the subarray has multiple elements and the sum condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The prefix sum and prefix count arrays are used efficiently to handle the queries.

Correctness: **True**
