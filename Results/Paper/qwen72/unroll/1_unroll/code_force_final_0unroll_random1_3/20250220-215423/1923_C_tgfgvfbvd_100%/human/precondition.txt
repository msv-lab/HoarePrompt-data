c is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), n and q are positive integers (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and queries is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
