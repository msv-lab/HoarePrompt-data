Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by checking if either dimension of the rectangle is even, and if so, whether the halves of that dimension are not equal to the other dimension. This logic is based on the observation that if a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle (not just a 90-degree rotation of the original), then the original rectangle must have at least one even dimension, and the halves of that even dimension must be different from the other dimension.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions `a` and `b`.
2. **Even Dimension Check**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` (which is the length of the two resulting halves) is not equal to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` (which is the length of the two resulting halves) is not equal to `a`.
3. **Output**: If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The logic is sound because:
- If both dimensions are odd, no cut can produce a rectangle with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the halves of that dimension are not equal to the other dimension, then the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

However, there is a minor issue in the program:
- The conditions `if a % 2 == 0` and `if b % 2 == 0` are checked separately, and the program might print 'Yes' twice for the same test case if both conditions are true. This can be fixed by combining the conditions into a single check.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 and a // 2 != b) or (b % 2 == 0 and b // 2 != a):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Given the original program, it still works correctly for the provided test cases, but the combined condition is more efficient and avoids redundant checks.

Correctness: **True** (but can be improved for efficiency and clarity)
