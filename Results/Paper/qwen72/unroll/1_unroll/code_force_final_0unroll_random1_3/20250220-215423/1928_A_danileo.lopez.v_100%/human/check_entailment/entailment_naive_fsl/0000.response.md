Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are even and the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original. For example, for the input `4 4`, the program outputs `No`, but it should output `Yes` because a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles, and these can be used to form a 2x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x4 rectangle.
