The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the area of the rectangle for each test case.
