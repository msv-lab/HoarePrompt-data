The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The input value for `t` must be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables `a` and `b` remain as integers with the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the function is still expected to handle multiple test cases based on the value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should handle multiple test cases based on the value of `t`.**
