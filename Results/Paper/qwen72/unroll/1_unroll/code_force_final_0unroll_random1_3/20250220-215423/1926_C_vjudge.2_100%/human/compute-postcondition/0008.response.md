Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`). It precomputes a list `pd` of length `200001`, where each element `pd[i]` for `1 <= i < 200001` is the sum of all previous elements in the list plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`. For each test case, it prints the value of `pd[n]`. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
