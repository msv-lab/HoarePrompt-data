Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `pd` of size `N` (where `N` is 200001) with zeros. This list is used to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for all `i` in the range.

2. **Precomputation**: It precomputes the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sum in the `pd` list. This is done using a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over each number `i` from 1 to 200000, and the inner loop iterates over each digit of the number `i`. The digit sum of `i` is added to `pd[i]`, and `pd[i]` is also updated by adding `pd[i-1]` to it, which ensures that `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the value of `n` and printing the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` from the `pd` list.

4. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(N * log(N)) time, where `N` is 200000. This is efficient enough given the constraints. The processing of each test case is O(1) since it involves a simple lookup in the `pd` list.

5. **Correct Output**: The program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums for each test case, as demonstrated by the example provided in the problem description.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
