Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in the list `pd`. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that the program can handle the input constraints efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step ensures that the sum of digits for each number is calculated only once, and the retrieval for each test case is done in constant time. The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 1, 2, or 3, and larger values like 1434, 2024, and 200000. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
