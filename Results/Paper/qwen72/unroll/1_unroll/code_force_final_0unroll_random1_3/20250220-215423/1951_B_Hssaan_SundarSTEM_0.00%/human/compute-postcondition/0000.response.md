The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
