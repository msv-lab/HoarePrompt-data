#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be defined with parameters to handle the problem, but the provided function definition is incomplete. Typically, the function should take a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, an integer `n` representing the number of cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The ratings list `a` should contain `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9, and `k` should be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the function prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before the cow at index `k` (after the swap operations) such that the ratings of these cows are not greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` are updated and reset for each test case, but the overall state of the program remains ready to handle the next test case until all `t` test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, an integer `n` for the number of cows, and an integer `k` for the index of your cow. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before the cow at index `k` such that their ratings are not greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. The function does not return any value but modifies and resets its internal variables for each test case, ensuring it is ready to process the next test case until all `t` test cases are completed.
