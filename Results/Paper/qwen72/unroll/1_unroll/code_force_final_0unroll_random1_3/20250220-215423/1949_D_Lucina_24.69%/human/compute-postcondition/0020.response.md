Postcondition: ***`sa` contains the row indices where there is at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions, and `sb` contains the column indices where there is at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions. The values of `n` and `xx` remain unchanged. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the loop prints modified strings `nx` for each iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`, where `nx` is the same as the initial state, and `sa` may have additional indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `sa` remains unchanged, `sb` may have additional elements appended, which are the row indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, and the loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`, where `nx` is constructed by replacing '?' characters in `xx[i]` with 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise replacing '?' with 'F'.***
