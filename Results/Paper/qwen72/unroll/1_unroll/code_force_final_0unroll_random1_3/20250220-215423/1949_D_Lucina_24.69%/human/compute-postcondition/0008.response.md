The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list, `a` and `b` will contain the counts of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each row and column, respectively, `xx` will be a list containing the empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
