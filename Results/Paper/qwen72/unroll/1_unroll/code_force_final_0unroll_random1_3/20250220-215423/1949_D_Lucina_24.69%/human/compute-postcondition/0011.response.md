To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `i` will start at 1 and iterate up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `sa` contains the row indices where there is at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions.
- `sb` contains the column indices where there is at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions.
- The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
- The values of `n` and `xx` remain unchanged.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
