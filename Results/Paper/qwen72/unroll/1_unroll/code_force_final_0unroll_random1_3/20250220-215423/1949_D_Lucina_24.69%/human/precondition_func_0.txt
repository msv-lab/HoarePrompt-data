n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each string represents a row in the transition video plan. The characters in the strings are either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided.
