Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of assigning transition videos (either funny 'F' or scary 'S') between scenarios in a video game, ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The program takes the following steps:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) strings, each of length \( n \), representing the transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, to keep track of the counts of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each row and column, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string prepended to ensure 1-based indexing.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Transitions**:
   - The program iterates through the input matrix to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each row and column, updating `a` and `b` accordingly.

3. **Identifying Rows and Columns with Only One Type of Transition**:
   - The program identifies rows that have at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions, storing their indices in `sa`.
   - It also identifies columns that have at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions, storing their indices in `sb`.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the number of rows with only 'F' transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of columns with only 'S' transitions (`sb`), the program adds any undecided rows (rows with no transitions) to `sa`.
   - For each row, it constructs a new string `nx` by replacing '?' characters:
     - If the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, it replaces '?' with 'F'.
     - Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'S'.
   - If the number of rows with only 'F' transitions (`sa`) is less than the number of columns with only 'S' transitions (`sb`), the program adds any undecided rows to `sb`.
   - For each row, it constructs a new string `nx` by replacing '?' characters:
     - If the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, it replaces '?' with 'S'.
     - Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'F'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified transition plan, ensuring that the transition plan is symmetric and meets the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Symmetry**: The program ensures that the transition plan remains symmetric by reading the input matrix and using the same logic for both rows and columns.
- **Counting**: The program correctly counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each row and column.
- **Assignment Logic**:
  - The logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to undecided transitions is designed to balance the number of consecutive transitions of the same type.
  - By dividing the indices into quarters, the program aims to distribute the transitions in a way that avoids long sequences of the same type.

### Potential Issues:
- **Balancing Consecutive Transitions**: The program's logic for assigning transitions to avoid more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is not foolproof. It relies on a simple quarter-based division, which might not always ensure the required balance for all permutations of scenarios.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where the number of decided transitions is very low or very high, which might affect the distribution logic.

### Conclusion:
While the program's logic is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem, it may not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
