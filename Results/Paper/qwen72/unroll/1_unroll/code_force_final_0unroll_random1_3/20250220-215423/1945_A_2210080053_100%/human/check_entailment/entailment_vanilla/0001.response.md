### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` with the line `b += c`.
   - This adjustment is made because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that the division is performed with floor division, and the negative sign is used to handle the floor division correctly for negative numbers.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by subtracting the number of full tents from the number of introverts.
     - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- **Correctness of `b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
- **Correctness of `a - -b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the total number of tents needed, considering that introverts always need their own tent.
- **Correctness of the Conditional Expression:**
  - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` ensures that if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts, the program outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no participants mean no tents are needed.
- **When `a > 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `a` because each introvert needs their own tent.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because there are no universals to fill the tents required by extroverts.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c > 0`:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of tents needed and checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It calculates the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
**True**
