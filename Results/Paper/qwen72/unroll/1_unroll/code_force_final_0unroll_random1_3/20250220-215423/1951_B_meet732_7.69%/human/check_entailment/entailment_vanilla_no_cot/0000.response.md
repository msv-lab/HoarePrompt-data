Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not fully defined:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list `l` but it is not clear what the function is supposed to return. The function should be designed to calculate the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining the maximum number of wins:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the cases where the cow `k` can be swapped to maximize its wins. Specifically, the function does not consider the optimal position to swap the cow to achieve the maximum number of wins.

3. **Special case handling:**
   - The special case `if k == 14:` is not relevant to the problem and should not be included.

4. **Incorrect return values:**
   - The return values in the function do not always correctly represent the maximum number of wins. For example, the return value `k - 1` in the case `if ind[0] == 0:` is not necessarily correct.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Determine the initial number of wins for cow `k` without any swaps.**
2. **Consider the optimal position to swap cow `k` to maximize its wins.**
3. **Return the maximum number of wins between the initial wins and the wins after the optimal swap.**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(a, k):
    n = len(a)
    x = a[k]
    initial_wins = 0
    for i in range(k, n - 1):
        if x > a[i + 1]:
            initial_wins += 1
        else:
            break

    # Find the optimal position to swap
    optimal_wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i != k:
            a[i], a[k] = a[k], a[i]
            wins = 0
            for j in range(i, n - 1):
                if a[j] > a[j + 1]:
                    wins += 1
                else:
                    break
            optimal_wins = max(optimal_wins, wins)
            a[i], a[k] = a[k], a[i]  # Swap back to original position

    return max(initial_wins, optimal_wins)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(max_wins(l, k))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Wins Calculation:**
  - The function `max_wins` first calculates the number of wins cow `k` would achieve without any swaps.
- **Optimal Swap Calculation:**
  - The function then iterates through all possible positions to swap cow `k` and calculates the number of wins for each position.
  - It keeps track of the maximum number of wins achieved through any swap.
- **Return the Maximum:**
  - Finally, it returns the maximum number of wins between the initial wins and the optimal swap wins.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all cases and provides the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
