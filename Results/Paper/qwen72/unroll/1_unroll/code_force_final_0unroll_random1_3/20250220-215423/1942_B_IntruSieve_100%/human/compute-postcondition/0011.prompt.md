You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: `n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] > 0`, or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] <= 0`, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` after processing all elements in `arr`, and `used` is a dictionary containing all integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the `mex` list separated by a space. The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `used` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of valid permutations for each test case.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
