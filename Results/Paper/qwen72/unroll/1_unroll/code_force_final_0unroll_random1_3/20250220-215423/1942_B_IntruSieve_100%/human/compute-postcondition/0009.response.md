The provided Python code snippet is an empty `print()` statement. Based on the initial state, the loop prints each element in the `mex` list separated by a space, and then the `print()` statement is executed. 

Since the `print()` statement is empty, it will simply print a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line without printing any additional content.

Output: **(a newline character)**

To provide more context:
- The `mex` list is printed in the loop, with each element separated by a space.
- After the loop completes, the `print()` statement is executed, which prints a newline character.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `used` remain unchanged and are not affected by the `print()` statement.
