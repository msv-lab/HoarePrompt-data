Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer. The list `arr` now contains the integers provided by the user.
