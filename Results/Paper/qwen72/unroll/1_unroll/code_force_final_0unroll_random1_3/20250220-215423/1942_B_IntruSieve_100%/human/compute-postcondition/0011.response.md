Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a single test case. It accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from user input. It generates a list `mex` where each element is determined based on the current smallest non-negative integer not found in the `used` dictionary. If the current element in `arr` is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. If the current element is non-positive, the absolute difference between the current element and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. After processing all elements, the function prints each element in `mex` separated by a space, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `arr`, the `mex` list that has been printed, and the `used` dictionary that contains all integers added to `mex` as keys with their values set to `True`. **
