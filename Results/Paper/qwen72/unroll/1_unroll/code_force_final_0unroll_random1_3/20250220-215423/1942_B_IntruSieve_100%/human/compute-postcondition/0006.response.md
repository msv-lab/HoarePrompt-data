Output State: **`n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] > 0`, or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] <= 0`, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` after processing all elements in `arr`, and `used` is a dictionary containing all integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.**
