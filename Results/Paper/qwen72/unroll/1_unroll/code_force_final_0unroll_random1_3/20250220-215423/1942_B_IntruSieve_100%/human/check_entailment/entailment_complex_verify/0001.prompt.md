You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.

    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}

        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:

            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: `n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] > 0`, or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` if `arr[i] <= 0`, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` after processing all elements in `arr`, and `used` is a dictionary containing all integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the `mex` list separated by a space. The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `used` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case. It accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from user input. It generates a list `mex` where each element is determined based on the current smallest non-negative integer not found in the `used` dictionary. If the current element in `arr` is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. If the current element is non-positive, the absolute difference between the current element and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. After processing all elements, the function prints each element in `mex` separated by a space, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `arr`, the `mex` list that has been printed, and the `used` dictionary that contains all integers added to `mex` as keys with their values set to `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the MEX Function**:
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of a sequence of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - The array `a` is constructed such that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It then constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` and prints it.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes a variable `minn` to 0, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the elements that have already been used in the permutation `p`.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means `p[i]` is the current MEX value, which is `minn`.
       - The program appends `minn` to the `mex` list.
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused value.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - The program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
       - It marks `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used in the `used` dictionary.

5. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should handle up to `10^4` test cases and `n` up to `2 * 10^5` efficiently.

7. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX function.
   - The output matches the expected format and constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
