Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases. Each element in `cases` is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is updated to the input string. `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
