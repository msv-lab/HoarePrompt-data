You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: The loop does not execute fully because it returns in the first iteration where `i` is not in `win`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged, `win` remains an empty set, and `ps` remains unchanged. The loop returns a string that is the concatenation of `ans`, the first character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m`. It processes the string `s` to find contiguous subsequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such subsequences found is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns 'YES'. If fewer than `n` such subsequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and returns a string that is the concatenation of the characters found in the subsequences, the first character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last subsequence, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also initializes an empty set `win` and an empty list `ans`.

2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the size of `win` reaches `k`, it means that all `k` alphabets have been seen in the current window. The program then appends `i` to `ans`, increments `ps` (a counter for the number of valid subsequences found), and clears `win`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if the number of valid subsequences found (`ps`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints "YES" and returns.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`:
     - It finds a character `i` in `us` that is not in `win`.
     - It appends this character to `ans` and fills the rest of the string with 'a' to make it of length `n`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The program's logic for checking subsequences is flawed. It only checks if all `k` characters appear in a window and then clears the window, which does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "abba"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program will only find "ab" and "ba" as valid subsequences, but it will miss "aa" and "bb".

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending a character not in `win` and filling the rest with 'a'. This approach is incorrect because the missing subsequence should be a valid string of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets.
   - For example, if `s = "abb"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly print "aa" instead of "bb".

3. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variable `rrr` is initialized with a random number but is never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
