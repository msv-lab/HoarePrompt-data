You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), but this is not reflected in the provided function definition.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user. The loop prints the value of `count` for each iteration, which is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adjusted by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that the given binary string can be divided into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to track if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if consecutive characters are different.
     - If they are different, it increments `count`.
     - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `count`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies transitions between different characters and increments the `count` for each transition.
   - The `flag` is used to ensure that if there is a transition from '0' to '1', we do not count the last piece twice. This is because the last piece can be combined with the piece before it if the transition is from '0' to '1'.
   - The program handles the edge cases where the string is already sorted (all '0's or all '1's) by outputting 1.
   - The program also handles the case where the string is not sorted but can be rearranged by cutting it into the minimum number of pieces.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For `11010`, the program will count the transitions: `11` (no transition), `10` (transition), `01` (transition), `10` (transition). It will set `flag` to `True` and output `3` after decrementing `count` by 1.
   - For `00000000`, there are no transitions, so it outputs `1`.
   - For `1`, there are no transitions, so it outputs `1`.
   - For `10`, it will count the transition `10` and output `2`.
   - For `0001111`, there are no transitions, so it outputs `1`.
   - For `0110`, it will count the transitions: `01` (transition), `11` (no transition), `10` (transition). It will set `flag` to `True` and output `2` after decrementing `count` by 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by identifying the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately.
