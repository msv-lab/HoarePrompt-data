Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), but this is not reflected in the provided function definition.**

To better align with the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the argument `s` and possibly `t` if it's intended to handle multiple test cases. Here's a revised function definition:

```python
def min_pieces_to_sort_binary_string(s, t=1):
```

However, since the function definition provided does not include `s` or `t`, the precondition is based on the assumption that `s` is the input string and `t` is managed outside of the function.
