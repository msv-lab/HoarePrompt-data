The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from user input. It then processes each binary string to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1', and adjusts this count by subtracting 1 if a '0' to '1' transition is found. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each binary string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will be the last input binary string provided by the user.
