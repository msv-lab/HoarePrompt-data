The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n` and `k`. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**
