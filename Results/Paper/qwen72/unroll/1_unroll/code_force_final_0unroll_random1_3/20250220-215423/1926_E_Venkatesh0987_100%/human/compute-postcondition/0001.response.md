Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions provided. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are modified within the loop, but their final values after the loop execution are not retained for the next iteration. Therefore, the initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` for the next test case are read from input.**

In natural language: The loop processes each test case independently, and after all iterations, the only variable that remains unchanged is `t`, which is the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are read from input, and the loop prints a result for each test case based on the given conditions. The internal variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are reset for each new test case.
