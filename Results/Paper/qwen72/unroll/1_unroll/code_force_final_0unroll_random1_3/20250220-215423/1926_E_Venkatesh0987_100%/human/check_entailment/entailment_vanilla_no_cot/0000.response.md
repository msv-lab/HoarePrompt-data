Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down based on the rules described in the problem. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Odd-numbered cards**: If `k` is within the range of the first half of the cards (i.e., `k <= (n + 1) // 2`), the k-th card is simply the k-th odd number, which is `2 * k - 1`.

2. **Non-odd-numbered cards**: If `k` is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards, the program needs to determine the position of the k-th card among the remaining cards that are multiples of 2, 4, 8, etc., times an odd number.

   - The program uses a loop to count the number of cards laid down in each step (starting with odd-numbered cards, then twice odd, then four times odd, etc.).
   - It keeps track of the total number of cards laid down (`s`) and the remaining number of cards (`d`).
   - It also keeps track of the step number (`i`), which corresponds to the power of 2 (i.e., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.).
   - Once `s` exceeds `k`, it calculates the exact position of the k-th card in the current step using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, where `f` is the adjusted position within the current step.

The program correctly handles the transition from odd-numbered cards to higher multiples of odd numbers and prints the correct k-th card for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
