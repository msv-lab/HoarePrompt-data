The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and the conditions for `n` and `k` do not directly affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
