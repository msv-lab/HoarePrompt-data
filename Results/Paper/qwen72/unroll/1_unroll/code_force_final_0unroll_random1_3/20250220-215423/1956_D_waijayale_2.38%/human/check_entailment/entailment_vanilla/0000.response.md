### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r` (i.e., the subarray is a single element), it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If so, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
     - It calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, initializes the array `a`, and calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results as required by the problem statement.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The MEX value is correctly identified and applied to the subarray.
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The program correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is also not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_2` should pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

5. **Corrected Program:**

   ```python
   def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
       if l == r:
           if a[l] != 0:
               ops.append((l, l))
               a[l] = 0
           return
       func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
       if a[l] != r - l + 1:
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
           func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

   def func_2(a):
       n = len(a)
       ops = []

       def recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
           s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
           if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
               func_1(a, l, r, ops)
               ops.append((l, r))
               for i in range(l, r + 1):
                   a[i] = r - l + 1
           else:
               mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
               pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
               if pos != l:
                   recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, pos - 1, ops)
               if pos != r:
                   recursive_maximize_sum(a, pos + 1, r, ops)

       recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
       return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

   def func_3():
       n = int(input())
       a = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
       print(s, m)
       for (l, r) in ops:
           print(l + 1, r + 1)
   ```

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has issues with the function definitions and the way they are called. Specifically, the `recursive_maximize_sum` function and `func_1` function need to correctly pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments. The corrected program should work as intended.
