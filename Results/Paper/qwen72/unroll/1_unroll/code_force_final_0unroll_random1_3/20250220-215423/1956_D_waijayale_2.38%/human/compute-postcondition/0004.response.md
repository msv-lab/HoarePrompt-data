The objects in the loop head are the variables `l`, `r`, and the list `ops`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`. The values of `l` and `r` will be determined by the first tuple in `ops` when the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples. The values of `l` and `r` will be the first elements of the first tuple in `ops`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` and `m` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`**
