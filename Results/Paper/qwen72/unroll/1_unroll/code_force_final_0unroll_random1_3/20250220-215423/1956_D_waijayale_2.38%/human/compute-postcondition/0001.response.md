The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
