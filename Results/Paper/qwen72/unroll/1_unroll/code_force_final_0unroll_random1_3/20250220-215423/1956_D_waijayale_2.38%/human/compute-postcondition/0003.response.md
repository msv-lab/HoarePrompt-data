To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `m` based on the initial state and the function `func_2(a)`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input `n` and List `a`**:
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers, also provided by the user. The length of `a` is `n`.

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - The function `func_2(a)` returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.
   - Without the exact implementation of `func_2(a)`, we can only infer the types and potential meanings of `s` and `m` based on common programming practices.

3. **Common Interpretation**:
   - `s` is often used to represent a sum.
   - `m` is often used to represent a maximum or minimum value.
   - `ops` might represent a count of operations or some other derived value.

4. **Output of `func_2(a)`**:
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.
   - `s` will be the sum of some elements in the list `a`.
   - `m` will be the maximum or minimum value of some elements in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print(s, m)` statement will print the values of `s` and `m` as returned by the function `func_2(a)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we can only describe the values in general terms.

Output: **s, m (where s is the sum of some elements in the list `a` and m is the maximum or minimum value of some elements in the list `a`)**
