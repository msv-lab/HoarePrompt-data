The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should be called with these inputs provided in a structured format, such as a list of tuples or a similar data structure that can hold the test cases. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
