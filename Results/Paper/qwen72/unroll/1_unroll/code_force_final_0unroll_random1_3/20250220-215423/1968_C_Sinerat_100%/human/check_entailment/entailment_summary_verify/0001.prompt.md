You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a new list `a` of `n` integers where `a[0]` is always 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]`. The function prints the elements of the list `a` for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a list `a` of `n` integers has been printed, where `a[0] = 1000` and `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of elements `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the list `x` of `n-1` integers for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `a[0]` to 1000. This is a valid choice because `a_1` can be any integer between 1 and \(10^9\).

3. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - The program iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` and that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be equal to `x[i-1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
  - The initial value of `a[0]` is 1000, which is within the range.
  - Each subsequent value `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, where `x[i-1]` is at least 1. Therefore, `a[i]` will always be greater than `a[i-1]` and will not exceed \(10^9\) as long as the sum of the elements in `x` does not exceed \(10^9 - 1000\). Given the constraints, this is a valid assumption.

- **Condition 2:** \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
  - By setting `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, we ensure that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will always be `x[i-1]` because `a[i-1]` is a multiple of itself plus `x[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that it satisfies both conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
