Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Annotated Functions:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: The list `l` is modified such that the last element is moved to the position `-k` (if `1 + i > k`) or to the beginning of the list (if `1 + i <= k`). The value of `k` is updated to `k - i + 1` in each iteration until the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 10^12). It returns a modified list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` where the last element of the list is moved to a new position based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` unchanged. If `1 + i > k` for any iteration, the last element is moved to the position `-k` in the list, and the function returns the modified list. Otherwise, the last element is repeatedly moved to the beginning of the list until the loop completes, and the function returns the final modified list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even.
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is even, the function calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` (if `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`; if `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`). If `k` exceeds `max_k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The list l remains unchanged, and the integers in l are printed in the same order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    return
    #The program returns nothing, but the integers in the list `l` are printed in the same order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation. It prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list `l` in the same order they appear, separated by spaces, and then prints an empty line. The function does not modify the list `l` and returns nothing.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the specific values returned by `func_2()`, but these values are not returned by the current code snippet.
    #State: `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` are now the specific values returned by `func_2()`, and they still adhere to the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` updates the values of `n` and `k` internally by calling `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without performing any further actions. If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`. The function does not return any value.
