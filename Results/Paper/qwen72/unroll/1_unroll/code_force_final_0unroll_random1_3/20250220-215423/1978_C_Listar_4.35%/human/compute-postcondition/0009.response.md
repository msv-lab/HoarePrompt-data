Functionality: ** The function `func_4` updates the values of `n` and `k` internally by calling `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without performing any further actions. If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`. The function does not return any value. **
