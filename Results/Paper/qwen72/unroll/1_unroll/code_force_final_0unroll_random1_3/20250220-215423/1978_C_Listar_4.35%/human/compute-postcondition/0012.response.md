Output State: **The program returns `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
