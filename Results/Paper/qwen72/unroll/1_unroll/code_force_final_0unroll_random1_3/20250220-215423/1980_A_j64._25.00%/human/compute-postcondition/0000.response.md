Output State: **The function definition is added to the program, and no variables are changed. The initial state remains: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
