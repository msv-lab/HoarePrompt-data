Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through each test case, counts the frequency of each difficulty level in the given problem bank, and calculates the number of missing problems required to hold the specified number of rounds. The logic used to determine the number of missing problems is accurate, and the program outputs the correct results for the given example test cases.
