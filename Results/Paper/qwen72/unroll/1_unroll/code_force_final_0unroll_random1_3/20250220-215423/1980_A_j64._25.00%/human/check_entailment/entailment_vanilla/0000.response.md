Reasoning:  
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n` (number of problems in the bank), `m` (number of rounds), and `a` (string of problem difficulties).

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding frequency in the list. This is done using the expression `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1`, which correctly maps each character to its index in the frequency list.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the frequency of a particular difficulty level. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, the expression returns 0. The `sum` function then adds up the missing problems for all difficulty levels.

4. **Result Collection**: The results for each test case are collected in a list `results` and returned by the function `func_1`.

5. **Output**: The main part of the program iterates over the results and prints them, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
