### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - The output should be "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence, otherwise "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that does not occur.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences and `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in some order, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Bitmask Explanation:**
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` checks if the current character has not been seen before.
   - `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the bitmask to include the current character.
   - `cur == (1 << k) - 1` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in some order.
   - `cnt` is incremented each time all `k` characters are seen in some order.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program's logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed.
   - It only appends one missing character and then appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to complete the string of length `n`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`. For example, if `s` is "abba" and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly construct "aa" as a missing subsequence, which is actually a subsequence of "abba".

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of valid subsequences of length `n` using the bitwise approach.
   - However, the construction of the missing subsequence is incorrect and does not ensure that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the construction of the missing subsequence. It only appends one missing character and then appends 'a' characters, which may not form a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence. The logic for generating the missing subsequence needs to be more robust to ensure it does not match any subsequence in `s`.
