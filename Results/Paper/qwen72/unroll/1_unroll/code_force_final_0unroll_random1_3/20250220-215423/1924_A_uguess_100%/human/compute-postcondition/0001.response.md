The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, which means `t` is already in a valid range for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized correctly for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0**
