Output State: **The loop finishes executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `L` is populated with values calculated from `n` and `k`, and the appropriate value based on the conditions is printed. The variables `n` and `k` are reset for each test case, and `t` is decremented to 0. The final state of `t` is 0, and `L`, `tot`, and `pow` are reset to their initial states for each iteration.**
