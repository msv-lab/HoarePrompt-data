Output State: **The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values for each iteration of the loop, and `a` and `b` are updated with new lists of integers for each iteration. The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and are updated based on the loop logic. After the loop, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will either both be equal to `newk` (k // 2) and the output will be 'yes', or they will not be equal to `newk` and the output will be 'no'.**
