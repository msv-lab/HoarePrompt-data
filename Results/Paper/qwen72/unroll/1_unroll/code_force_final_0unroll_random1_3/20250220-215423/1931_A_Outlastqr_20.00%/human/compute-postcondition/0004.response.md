Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and reads an integer from the user input that specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and prints a string based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, the string will be the letter at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the string will be 'a' followed by the letter at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26, the string will be 'aa' followed by the letter at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings to the console. The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
