### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs using the promotion.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` where:
     - `A` is the number of yogurts `n`.
     - `B` is the price of one yogurt `a`.
     - `C` is the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - **Case 1:** If the price of two yogurts individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
     - The program prints `A * B`.
   - **Case 2:** If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it is possible to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion.
     - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - **Case 3:** If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, one yogurt will need to be bought individually, and the rest can be bought in pairs using the promotion.
     - The program calculates the number of pairs `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`.
     - `A` is even, so the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
     - Output: `9` (Correct)
   - **Example 2:** `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`.
     - `A` is odd, so the cost is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - Output: `14` (Correct)
   - **Example 3:** `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`.
     - The cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
     - Output: `15` (Correct)
   - **Example 4:** `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`.
     - The cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
     - Output: `20` (Correct)

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is even or odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the promotion price is more expensive than buying two yogurts individually.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering the promotion price and the individual price.

**Correctness: True**
