Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`. This is correct.
   - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper or equal to buying them individually, it proceeds to calculate the minimum cost:
     - If `A` is even, it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so the total cost is `A * C / 2`. This is correct.
     - If `A` is odd, it means Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`. This is also correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case. This is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case: `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `A * C / 2 = 2 * 9 / 2 = 9`. This is correct.
   - For the second test case: `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `X = 3 // 2 = 1` and `X * C + B = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`. This is correct.
   - For the third test case: `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 3 * 5 = 15`. This is correct.
   - For the fourth test case: `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 4 * 5 = 20`. This is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `A` is 1, the program will always use the regular price `B` because `A // 2` will be 0.
     - When `A` is 2, the program will use the promotion price `C` if it is cheaper than `2 * B`.

6. **General Correctness**:
   - The program's logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly determines whether to use the regular price or the promotion price based on the given conditions and calculates the minimum cost accordingly.

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided example.
