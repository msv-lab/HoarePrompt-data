Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost. The issue lies in the conditions and the way the costs are calculated. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Condition `if B * 2 < C:`**
   - This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If true, it prints the total cost as `A * B`, which is correct because it means Maxim should buy all yogurts at the regular price.

2. **Condition `elif A % 2 == 0:`**
   - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price. This is correct for even `A`.

3. **Condition `else:`**
   - This condition handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X = A // 2` and then prints `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the remaining single yogurt should always be bought at the regular price, which may not be the optimal solution.

The correct approach should consider the following:
- If `B * 2 < C`, then buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.
- If `B * 2 >= C`, then:
  - For even `A`, the cost is `A * C / 2`.
  - For odd `A`, the cost should be `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`, but it should also compare this with `X * C + C - B` to ensure the minimum cost.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                # Compare buying the last yogurt at regular price vs. buying an extra pair
                print(min(X * C + B, (X + 1) * C))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd values of `A`.
