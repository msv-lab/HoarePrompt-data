Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `r` is a string containing the unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `r` in reverse order.**

For example, if `r` is "abc", then `mapping` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`. The dictionary `mapping` is created by pairing each character in `r` with the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`.
