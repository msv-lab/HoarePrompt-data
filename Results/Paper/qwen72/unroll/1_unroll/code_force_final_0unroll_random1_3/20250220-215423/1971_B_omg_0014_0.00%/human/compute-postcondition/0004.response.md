Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. If the string `s` contains more than two distinct characters, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of the string `s`, depending on whether the sorted string `s` is equal to the original string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. **
