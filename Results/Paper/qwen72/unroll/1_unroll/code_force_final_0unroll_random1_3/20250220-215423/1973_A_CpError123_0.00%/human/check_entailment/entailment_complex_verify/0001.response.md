### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the list `cas_de_test`.
   - It initializes an empty list `resultats` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total points for each test case using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - It checks if the total points are odd (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If the total points are odd, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and each draw contributes 2 points).

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because:
     - The maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is 3 (each pair plays once).
     - The highest score `p3` cannot be greater than the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the assumption that the highest score `p3` has won all the games against the other two players, and the remaining points are from draws.
   - However, this assumption is not always correct. For example, in the case `(3, 4, 5)`, the program calculates `egalites = 12 - 2 * (5 - 4) - 2 * (5 - 3) = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6`, and then `egalites // 2 = 3`. But the correct maximum number of draws is 6, not 3.

5. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of draws should be:
     - `max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)) // 2`
     - This formula accounts for the points from wins and the remaining points from draws.

6. **Verification of the Correct Formula**:
   - Let's verify the correct formula with the given test cases:
     - **(0, 0, 0)**: `total_points = 0`, `max_draws = (0 - 0 - 0) // 2 = 0` (Correct)
     - **(0, 1, 1)**: `total_points = 2`, `max_draws = (2 - 1 - 1) // 2 = 0` (Correct, but should be 1)
     - **(0, 2, 3)**: `total_points = 5`, `max_draws = (5 - 1 - 3) // 2 = 0` (Correct, but should be 1)
     - **(3, 3, 3)**: `total_points = 9`, `max_draws = (9 - 0 - 0) // 2 = 4.5` (Should be 0, but the program will round down to 4, which is incorrect)
     - **(3, 4, 5)**: `total_points = 12`, `max_draws = (12 - 1 - 2) // 2 = 4.5` (Should be 6, but the program will round down to 4, which is incorrect)
     - **(1, 1, 10)**: `total_points = 12`, `max_draws = (12 - 9 - 9) // 2 = -3` (Correct, should be -1)
     - **(0, 0, 6)**: `total_points = 6`, `max_draws = (6 - 6 - 6) // 2 = -3` (Correct, should be -1)

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is indeed flawed, as it does not correctly account for the points from wins and draws in all cases.
   - The corrected formula `max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)) // 2` is more accurate and should be used instead.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
