Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The total number of matches can be greater than 3, and the condition `p3 > total_matchs` is not always a valid check for the correctness of the scores. 

For example, consider the test case `(0, 0, 6)`. The total points are 6, which is even, and the total matches are 3. However, the program incorrectly concludes that this is an invalid case because `p3 > total_matchs` is true. In reality, this case is valid because it could be that the third player won all 3 games, and the other two players had no points. The correct output for this case should be 0 (no draws), but the program outputs -1. 

Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of draws is flawed. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for the distribution of points in all cases. For example, in the case `(0, 1, 1)`, the program correctly outputs 1, but for the case `(0, 2, 3)`, the program outputs 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, as the third player could have won one game and drawn one game with the second player, while the first player had no points.

To correct the program, the logic for determining the maximum number of draws and the validity of the scores needs to be revised.
