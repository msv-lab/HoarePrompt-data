You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the list `cas_de_test`.
   - It initializes an empty list `resultats` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points for each test case using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - It checks if the total points are odd (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If the total points are odd, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and each draw contributes 2 points).

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because:
     - The maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is 3 (each pair plays once).
     - The highest score `p3` cannot be greater than the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the total points can be split into points from wins and points from draws. The points from wins are `2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1)` because the highest score `p3` must have won all the games against the other two players.
   - It then checks if the number of draws `egalites` is negative (`if egalites < 0`). If it is, it appends `-1` to `resultats` because a negative number of draws is not possible.
   - If the number of draws is non-negative, it appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats` because each draw contributes 2 points.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case using `print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))`.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is used to calculate the number of draws. This formula assumes that the highest score `p3` has won all the games against the other two players, and the remaining points are from draws.
- However, this assumption is not always correct. For example, in the case `(3, 4, 5)`, the program calculates `egalites = 12 - 2 * (5 - 4) - 2 * (5 - 3) = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6`, and then `egalites // 2 = 3`. But the correct maximum number of draws is 6, not 3.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of draws should be:
  - `max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)) // 2`
  - This formula accounts for the points from wins and the remaining points from draws.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the number of draws is flawed. It does not correctly account for the points from wins and draws in all cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats

t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

### Output:
- The corrected program will produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**
