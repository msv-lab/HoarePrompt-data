### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points and Draws:**
   - Each game results in either 2 points (one win, one loss) or 2 points (draw).
   - Therefore, the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.
   - The total number of games played is `total_points // 2`.

2. **Valid Scores:**
   - The scores must be such that they can be achieved by a combination of wins, losses, and draws.
   - The maximum number of games played is `total_points // 2`.
   - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the total number of games played.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - Draws contribute 1 point to each player.
   - The formula to calculate the maximum number of draws is derived from the total points and the differences in scores.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total points are even: `if total_points % 2 != 0: resultats.append(-1)`.
   - This ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct as each match results in 2 points.

3. **Invalidity Check:**
   - The program checks if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`.
   - The condition `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The total number of matches can be greater than 3.
   - The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect. The highest score `p3` can be equal to the total number of matches, but it should not exceed it.

4. **Draw Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the points from wins and losses are subtracted from the total points to find the points from draws.
   - However, the formula does not correctly account for all possible distributions of points.

#### Test Cases:
- **(0, 0, 0):**
  - Total points: 0 (even)
  - Total matches: 0
  - No draws, correct output: 0

- **(0, 1, 1):**
  - Total points: 2 (even)
  - Total matches: 1
  - One draw, correct output: 1

- **(0, 2, 3):**
  - Total points: 5 (odd)
  - Total matches: 2.5 (not an integer, invalid)
  - Correct output: -1

- **(3, 3, 3):**
  - Total points: 9 (odd)
  - Total matches: 4.5 (not an integer, invalid)
  - Correct output: -1

- **(3, 4, 5):**
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Total matches: 6
  - Possible distribution: 3 wins, 3 draws
  - Correct output: 3

- **(1, 1, 10):**
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Total matches: 6
  - Possible distribution: 4 wins, 2 draws
  - Correct output: 2

- **(0, 0, 6):**
  - Total points: 6 (even)
  - Total matches: 3
  - Possible distribution: 3 wins, 0 draws
  - Correct output: 0

#### Revised Logic:
1. **Total Points and Matches:**
   - Ensure the total points are even.
   - Calculate the total matches: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.

2. **Valid Scores:**
   - Ensure `p3` does not exceed `total_matchs`.

3. **Draw Calculation:**
   - Calculate the number of wins and losses: `wins_losses = total_matchs - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)`.
   - Ensure the number of wins and losses is non-negative.
   - Calculate the number of draws: `egalites = total_matchs - wins_losses`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        wins_losses = total_matchs - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)
        
        if wins_losses < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            egalites = total_matchs - wins_losses
            resultats.append(egalites)
        
    return resultats
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **correct**. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the conditions for determining the validity of the scores and the calculation of the number of draws. The corrected logic and code provided above should handle all cases correctly.

Final: **False**
