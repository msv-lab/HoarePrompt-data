Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers. It processes each tuple to calculate the number of draws (egalites) based on the total points and certain conditions. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element is either the number of draws for the corresponding tuple in `cas_de_test` or -1 if the conditions for calculating draws are not met. The input parameters `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged after the function call. **
