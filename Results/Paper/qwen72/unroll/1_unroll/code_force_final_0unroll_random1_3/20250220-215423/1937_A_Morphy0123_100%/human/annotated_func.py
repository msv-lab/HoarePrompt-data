#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a. The array a is initially set such that a_i = i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function should return the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations for each i from 2 to n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the function has printed the position of 1 in the resulting array for each test case. The variable `n_cases` is unchanged, and the variable `i` is equal to `n_cases`. The variables `n` and `power` are undefined or reset after each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the position of the element 1 in the resulting array after performing swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 less than `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the position of 1 for each test case, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `power` are reset for each test case, so their final values are not meaningful.
