You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a. The array a is initially set such that a_i = i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function should return the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations for each i from 2 to n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the function has printed the position of 1 in the resulting array for each test case. The variable `n_cases` is unchanged, and the variable `i` is equal to `n_cases`. The variables `n` and `power` are undefined or reset after each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the position of 1 after performing the swap operations is flawed. The program uses a power of 2 calculation to determine the position, but this does not always yield the correct result.

For example, consider the input `n = 6`:
- Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(2)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(3)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(4)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(5)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(6)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]`.

The final position of 1 is 6, but the program would incorrectly output `4` for this input.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
