Functionality: ** The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then counts the number of times a '1' appears immediately before a '0' in the string and prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `s` holds the value of the last input binary string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
