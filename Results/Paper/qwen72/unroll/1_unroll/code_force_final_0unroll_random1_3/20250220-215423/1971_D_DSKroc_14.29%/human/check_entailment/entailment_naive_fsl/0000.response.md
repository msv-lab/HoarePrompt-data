Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. It iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' appears before a '0'. Each such occurrence indicates a point where the string must be cut to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. The program adds 1 to the count to account for the final piece. This logic works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as strings that are already sorted, strings with only one character, and strings with alternating '0's and '1's. Therefore, the program is correct.
