### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of different permutations that could have these indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the function is not directly used to solve the permutation problem. It seems to be a helper function for modular arithmetic, specifically for finding the modular inverse.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse is then used to compute \(a \cdot c \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(c\) is the modular inverse of \(b\).

4. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - The problem requires us to count the number of permutations that fit the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums provide constraints on where the maximum elements can be placed in the permutation.
   - The key observation is that the maximum element in the permutation must be at an index that is both a prefix maximum and a suffix maximum.
   - The number of valid permutations can be calculated by considering the constraints and using combinatorial methods.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic is necessary because the number of permutations can be very large, and we need to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse is used in combinatorial calculations to avoid division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly solving the permutation problem. They are helper functions for modular arithmetic.
   - To determine the correctness of the program, we need to see if these functions are used correctly in the main logic to solve the permutation problem.
   - The main logic for solving the permutation problem is missing. The program does not contain any code that processes the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not contain the main logic to solve the permutation problem. It only includes helper functions for modular arithmetic. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
