### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the `facts` list. This is done to efficiently compute combinations later in the program. The computation is correct and ensures that all factorials are stored modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. This is a standard approach for handling multiple test cases and is correct.

3. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index (`p[-1]`) is the same as the first suffix maximum index (`s[0]`), and if the first prefix maximum index (`p[0]`) is 1 and the last suffix maximum index (`s[-1]`) is `n`. These checks are necessary to ensure that the permutation is valid. If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, which is correct.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses a function `func_2` to calculate combinations. The function `func_2` itself calls `func_1`, which is intended to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect for the purpose of computing modular inverses. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which can be used to find the modular inverse, but the return values are not being used correctly.

5. **Combination Calculation (Continued):**
   - The program uses the incorrect `func_1` to compute the combination \( \binom{k}{r} \) as \( \frac{a}{b} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is incorrect because the modular inverse is not being computed correctly.

6. **Permutation Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, and using the combination function to determine the number of ways to place the remaining elements. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the combination calculations are likely to be incorrect.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the final result for each test case. Given the incorrect combination calculations, the final results are likely to be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function, which is used to compute the modular inverse. The modular inverse is crucial for the combination calculation, and without it, the program will not produce the correct number of permutations.

**Correctness: **False****
