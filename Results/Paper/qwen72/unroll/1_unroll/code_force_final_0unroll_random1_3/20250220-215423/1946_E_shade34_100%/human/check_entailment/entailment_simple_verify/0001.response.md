### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums provide constraints on the placement of the maximum elements in the permutation.
   - The answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function is indeed implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It is used to find the modular inverse of a number, which is necessary for performing division in modular arithmetic.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse is then used to compute \(a \cdot c \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(c\) is the modular inverse of \(b\).

4. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - The main logic of the program is designed to count the number of valid permutations based on the given constraints.
   - The program initializes a list `facts` with factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle combinatorial calculations efficiently.
   - It then processes each test case:
     - It checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions are not met, the permutation is invalid, and the program prints 0.
     - If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of valid permutations by:
       - Using the factorial values and modular inverses to compute the number of ways to arrange elements in the gaps between the suffix maximums.
       - Reversing the prefix maximums (excluding the last one) and using the same combinatorial method to compute the number of ways to arrange elements in the gaps between the reversed prefix maximums.
       - Multiplying the results of the combinatorial calculations for the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.
       - Printing the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic is correct and necessary to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.
   - The modular inverse is correctly computed and used in the combinatorial calculations.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given constraints.
   - The use of helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` for modular arithmetic is appropriate and correct.
   - The program processes the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and complete for the given problem. It correctly handles the constraints and uses combinatorial methods with modular arithmetic to count the number of valid permutations.

Final: **True**
