You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the values 1 and 0.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`, the specific values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b.
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus one. Given that a is divisible by b, the quotient (a // b) is an integer, and the second value will be a negative integer.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0.
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is an integer, and the result of `c - a // b * d` is also an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of two integers based on the following conditions: (1) If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). (2) If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the results of `func_1(b, a)` but swaps the order of the returned values. (3) If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, minus one. (4) In all other cases, it returns the second value from `func_1(b, a % b)` and a computed value based on the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `a` is an integer, and `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` with a length of at least 1. It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` or `b`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of different permutations that could have these indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the function is not directly used to solve the permutation problem. It seems to be a helper function for modular arithmetic, specifically for finding the modular inverse.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse is then used to compute \(a \cdot c \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(c\) is the modular inverse of \(b\).

4. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - The problem requires us to count the number of permutations that fit the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums provide constraints on where the maximum elements can be placed in the permutation.
   - The key observation is that the maximum element in the permutation must be at an index that is both a prefix maximum and a suffix maximum.
   - The number of valid permutations can be calculated by considering the constraints and using combinatorial methods.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic is necessary because the number of permutations can be very large, and we need to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse is used in combinatorial calculations to avoid division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly solving the permutation problem. They are helper functions for modular arithmetic.
   - To determine the correctness of the program, we need to see if these functions are used correctly in the main logic to solve the permutation problem.
   - The main logic for solving the permutation problem is missing. The program does not contain any code that processes the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not contain the main logic to solve the permutation problem. It only includes helper functions for modular arithmetic. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
