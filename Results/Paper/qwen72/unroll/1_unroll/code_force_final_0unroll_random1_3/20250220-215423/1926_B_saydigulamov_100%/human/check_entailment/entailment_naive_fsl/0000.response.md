Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program fails to correctly identify the shape in certain cases. Specifically, it only checks the first two rows of the grid that contain '1's to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the full structure of the shape. For example, consider the following grid:

```
3
010
111
010
```

This grid represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the first two rows with '1's both contain 3 '1's. The program should instead check the entire grid to ensure that the shape follows the rules for a triangle or a square.
