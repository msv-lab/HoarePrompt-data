You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is a list of n strings, each of length n, containing only '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times. During each iteration, it reads `t` lines of input, each line being a string of length `n` containing only '0' or '1'. For each line that contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged, and `a` is decremented by the number of iterations completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `a` from the input, then for each of the `a` test cases, it reads an integer `t` and a grid of `t` strings, each of length `n`. It processes each grid to count the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the first two rows with '1's have the same count of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `grid`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`, from the input. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Grid Analysis**: For each grid, the function checks each row to see if it contains any '1's. If a row contains '1's, it appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

3. **Shape Determination**:
   - The function then checks the first two elements of the list `k` to determine the shape.
   - If `k[0] == k[1]`, it prints "SQUARE". This is based on the fact that in a square, the number of '1's in each row is the same, so the first two rows should have the same count of '1's.
   - If `k[0] != k[1]`, it prints "TRIANGLE". This is based on the fact that in a triangle, the number of '1's in the first row is different from the number of '1's in the second row.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the size of the shape is greater than 1.
   - The function assumes that the grid is valid and contains the shape as described, so it does not need to handle invalid inputs.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function only checks the first two rows to determine the shape. This might not be sufficient to correctly identify the shape in all cases, especially if the shape is an upside-down triangle or if the triangle is not aligned with the top of the grid.
   - For example, if the triangle is upside-down, the first two rows might have the same number of '1's, which would incorrectly identify it as a square.
   - Similarly, if the triangle is not aligned with the top of the grid, the first two rows might not be the first two rows of the triangle, leading to incorrect identification.

Given these potential issues, the function is not robust enough to correctly identify the shape in all cases.
