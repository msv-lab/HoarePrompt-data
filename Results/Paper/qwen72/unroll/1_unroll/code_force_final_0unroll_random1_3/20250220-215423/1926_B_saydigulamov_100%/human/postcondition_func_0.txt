The function reads an integer `a` from the input, then for each of the `a` test cases, it reads an integer `t` and a grid of `t` strings, each of length `n`. It processes each grid to count the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the first two rows with '1's have the same count of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `grid`.
