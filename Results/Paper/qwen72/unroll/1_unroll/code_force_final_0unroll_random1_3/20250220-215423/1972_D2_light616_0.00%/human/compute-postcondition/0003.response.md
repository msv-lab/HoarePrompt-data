The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. Right before the loop, `x` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6. For the loop to execute the first time, `x * x` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `x` is 1, `x * x` is 1, which is always less than or equal to `n` given the constraints on `n`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n` and `m` are input positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
