Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the counts of the numbers are such that Bob can win more than once. Specifically, the program incorrectly increments the count of Bob's wins by 1 if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal and odd. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`. According to the program, Bob wins only once, but in reality, Bob can win multiple times depending on the sequence of removals. The program also does not correctly handle the removal of numbers to maximize Bob's wins, as it simply adds the floor division of each count by 2, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal number of wins for Bob.
