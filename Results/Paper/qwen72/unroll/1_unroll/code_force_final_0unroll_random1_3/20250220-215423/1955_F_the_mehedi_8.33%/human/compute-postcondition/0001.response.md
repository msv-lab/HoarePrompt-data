Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the sequence of integers `p_i` (where 1 <= i <= 4) remains unchanged. For each iteration, the loop prints the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- The sequence of integers `p_i` (where 1 <= i <= 4) is read into the list `a` during each iteration, but `a` itself is not modified and is reinitialized in each iteration.
- The variable `cnt` is recalculated in each iteration based on the conditions provided in the loop body and then printed. The value of `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
