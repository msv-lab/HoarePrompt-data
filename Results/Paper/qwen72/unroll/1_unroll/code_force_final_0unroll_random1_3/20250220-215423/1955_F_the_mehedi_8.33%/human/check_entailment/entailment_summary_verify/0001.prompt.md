You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a sequence of four integers `p_i` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200`) from the input, calculates a value `cnt` based on the sequence, and prints `cnt`. The value `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the sequence are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in the sequence by 2. The function does not modify the input values `t` or `p_i`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair has a zero XOR.
   - Specifically, for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 0\)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in a way that the remaining sequence has a zero XOR as often as possible.
   - If the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, and the counts of these numbers are equal, removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero.
   - For each number, removing pairs of the same number will not change the XOR (since \(x \oplus x = 0\)).
   - Removing an odd number of any number that contributes to a zero XOR will help in making the XOR zero.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The condition `if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd. This is a specific case where removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero.
   - The loop `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` adds the number of pairs of each number to `cnt`. This is correct because removing pairs of the same number does not change the XOR.
   - However, the program does not handle the general case where the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be paired in different ways to achieve a zero XOR.

6. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program should consider all possible ways to pair the numbers to achieve a zero XOR.
   - For example, if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not equal but can be paired to achieve a zero XOR, the program should account for that.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is not handling all possible cases where the XOR can be zero.
   - The specific condition and the loop are not sufficient to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
