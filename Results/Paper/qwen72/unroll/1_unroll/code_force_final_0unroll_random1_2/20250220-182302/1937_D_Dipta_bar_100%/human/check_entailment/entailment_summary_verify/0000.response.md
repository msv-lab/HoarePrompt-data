### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to understand its behavior and whether it correctly handles the given problem description, especially the edge cases.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the grid string `s`.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` to process the grid string and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `A` and `B` are lists that will store cumulative values.
     - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are lists that will store the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

   - **Processing '>' Characters:**
     - The first loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
     - For each '>' character, it calculates a value `x` based on the previous '>' characters and appends it to `A`.
     - It also appends the index of the current '>' character to `idx_A`.

   - **Processing '<' Characters:**
     - The second loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
     - For each '<' character, it calculates a value `x` based on the previous '<' characters and appends it to `B`.
     - It also appends the index of the current '<' character to `idx_B`.

   - **Calculating and Printing Results:**
     - The third loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
     - For each character, it determines whether it is '>' or '<'.
     - Depending on the character, it calculates the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid using the values stored in `A` and `B`.

3. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - **All '<' Characters:**
     - If `s` consists entirely of '<' characters, the first loop will not populate `A` and `idx_A`.
     - The second loop will populate `B` and `idx_B` with the indices of '<' characters.
     - The third loop will handle each '<' character by printing `i + 1` (the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid from the left).

   - **All '>' Characters:**
     - If `s` consists entirely of '>' characters, the first loop will populate `A` and `idx_A` with the indices of '>' characters.
     - The second loop will not populate `B` and `idx_B`.
     - The third loop will handle each '>' character by printing `n - i` (the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid from the right).

4. **Verification of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the grid string `s` consists entirely of one character, either all '<' or all '>'.
   - However, based on the analysis above, the program does handle these cases correctly:
     - For all '<' characters, it prints `i + 1` for each character.
     - For all '>' characters, it prints `n - i` for each character.

5. **Testing with Edge Cases:**
   - **All '<' Characters:**
     - Input: `1\n4\n<<<<`
     - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`
     - Program Output: `1 2 3 4`
   - **All '>' Characters:**
     - Input: `1\n4\n>>>>`
     - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`
     - Program Output: `1 2 3 4`

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid string `s` consists entirely of one character.
   - The logic for calculating the number of seconds for the pinball to leave the grid is correct for both general and edge cases.
