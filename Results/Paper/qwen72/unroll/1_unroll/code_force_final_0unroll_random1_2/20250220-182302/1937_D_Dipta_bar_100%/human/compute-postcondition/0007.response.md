The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `j` should be 0 for the loop to start. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
