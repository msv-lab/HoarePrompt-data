Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and prints a sequence of integers to the console. Each integer in the sequence represents a calculated value based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are populated with intermediate values used in the calculations. **
