### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative movements of the pinball when it starts from a cell with '>' and '<' respectively.
   - It also initializes two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Movements:**
   - For each '>' character, the program calculates the cumulative movement to the right and stores it in `A`.
   - For each '<' character, the program calculates the cumulative movement to the left and stores it in `B`.

4. **Processing Each Cell:**
   - The program iterates through each cell in the string `s` and determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The logic for calculating the time involves checking the direction of the pinball and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total time.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell in the grid for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cumulative Movements:**
  - The lists `A` and `B` are used to store the cumulative movements of the pinball when it starts from a cell with '>' and '<' respectively.
  - The indices `idx_A` and `idx_B` help in tracking the positions of '>' and '<' characters, which are crucial for the calculations.

- **Time Calculation:**
  - The program correctly handles the different scenarios for when the pinball starts from a cell with '>' or '<'.
  - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time, considering the inversion of the direction after each move.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely filled with '>' or '<' characters.
  - It also handles cases where the pinball starts from the first or last cell of the grid.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules. The use of cumulative movements and indices ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate. The program's structure and logic align with the problem description and the provided execution summary.

### Correctness:
**True**
