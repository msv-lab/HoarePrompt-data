To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(0, n):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`: The loop index.
- `n`: The upper limit of the loop range.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The loop index `i` starts at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
