Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 6`. The correct output should be a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 6, such as `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce this permutation and instead returns a permutation that does not meet the required Manhattan value. This indicates that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.
