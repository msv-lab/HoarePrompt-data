### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2:**
   - The function correctly checks if `k` is even, which is a necessary condition for a valid permutation.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - For odd `n`, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - For even `n`, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` is greater than the maximum value, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - This function is correct in its logic and implementation.

2. **Function 1:**
   - The function aims to generate a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with the list `l` containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning.
   - The logic for moving elements and decrementing `k` is flawed:
     - The condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent operations do not always result in a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
     - The decrement operation `k = k - i + 1` and the insertion operation `l.insert(0, x)` are not consistent with the required Manhattan value calculation.
   - For example, consider `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The function should return "No" because no permutation of length 4 can have a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation might incorrectly generate a permutation.

3. **Function 3:**
   - This function correctly prints the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.
   - This function is correct in its logic and implementation.

4. **Function 4:**
   - This function handles the input and output for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print it.
   - This function is correct in its logic and implementation, but it relies on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**
