The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` as being assigned by `func_2()`, and it specifies that the current value of `n` is 0. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
