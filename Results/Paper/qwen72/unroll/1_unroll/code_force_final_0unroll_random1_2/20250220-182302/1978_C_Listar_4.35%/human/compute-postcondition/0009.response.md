Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two non-negative integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_2()`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and terminates. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then passes the result of `func_1` to `func_3`. The function ultimately has no return value. **
