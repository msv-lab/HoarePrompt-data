Initial State: `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. `n` is not equal to 0. `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.

```
func_3(l)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `func_3(l)` calls the function `func_3` with the argument `l`. The value of `l` is determined by the previous call to `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_3` does not return any value, so the variables `n`, `k`, and `l` retain their values. The only impact is that `func_3` is executed with `l` as an argument.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. `n` is not equal to 0. `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. `func_3` is executed with `l` as an argument.**
