### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Function 2:**
   - The function correctly checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` is greater than the maximum value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct and ensures that only valid `n` and `k` pairs are passed to `func_1`.

3. **Function 1:**
   - The function starts with the list `l` containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning.
   - For each element, it checks if `k` is zero. If `k` is zero, it returns the list `l`.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list and returns `l`.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - The logic for moving elements and decrementing `k` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent operations do not always result in a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Function 3:**
   - This function correctly prints the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.

5. **Function 4:**
   - This function handles the input and output for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print it.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation of Function 1:
- The function `func_1` aims to construct a permutation by moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- The key issue lies in the logic for moving elements and decrementing `k`:
  - The condition `1 + i > k` is used to determine whether to move the last element to a specific position or to the beginning of the list.
  - However, this condition and the subsequent operations do not always result in a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
  - For example, consider `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The function will not correctly generate a permutation with a Manhattan value of 5 because the logic for decrementing `k` and moving elements is not robust enough to handle all cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**
