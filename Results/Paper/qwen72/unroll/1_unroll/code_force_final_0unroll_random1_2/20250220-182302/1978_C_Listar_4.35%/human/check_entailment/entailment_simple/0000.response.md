### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than `max_k`. If so, it returns `0, 0`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - If `k` is even and within the valid range, it returns `n, k`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as input and attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value.
   - It divides `k` by 2, which is a valid operation since `k` is guaranteed to be even by `func_2`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the last element to the first, attempting to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value:
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
     - Otherwise, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and decreases `k` by `i - 1`.
   - The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0 or when the condition `1 + i > k` is met.
   - The function returns the modified list `l`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It then prints an empty line.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get valid `n` and `k`.
   - If `func_2` returns `0, 0`, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_4`.
- **Even Check**: `func_2` correctly checks if `k` is even and returns `0, 0` if it is not, which is correct because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
- **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: `func_2` correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Permutation Construction**: `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. The logic of moving the last element to the appropriate position is correct and ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted as needed.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found, and "NO" if no valid permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It handles the input, checks the constraints, constructs the permutation, and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
