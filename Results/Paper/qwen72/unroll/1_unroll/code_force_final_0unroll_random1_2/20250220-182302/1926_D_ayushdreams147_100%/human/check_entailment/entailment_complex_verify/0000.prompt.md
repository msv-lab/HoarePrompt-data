You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the occurrences of certain integers, but the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` contains the number of unique integers in the list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is 0 or the key is not present. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of unique numbers by flipping their bits and using a dictionary to track the counts. However, this approach does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- The numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` can be grouped into two groups to satisfy the condition:
  - Group 1: `1` and `2`
  - Group 2: `3` and `4`

However, the program incorrectly outputs `4`, which means it places each number in its own group. This is because the program is not correctly checking the condition that no two numbers in the same group should have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. This can be achieved by using a bitmask to represent the 31 least significant bits and ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have the same bitmask. The minimum number of groups required would be the number of unique bitmasks.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    bitmasks = set()
    for num in a:
        bitmask = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        bitmasks.add(bitmask)
    return len(bitmasks)
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of groups required by using a set to track unique bitmasks. Each number is reduced to its 31 least significant bits using a bitmask, and the size of the set gives the minimum number of groups needed.
