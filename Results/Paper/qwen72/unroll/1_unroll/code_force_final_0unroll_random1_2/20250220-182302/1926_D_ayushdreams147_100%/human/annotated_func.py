#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the occurrences of certain integers, but the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` contains the number of unique integers in the list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is 0 or the key is not present. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
