Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a` that have a complementary integer (i.e., an integer that when XORed with (1 << 31) - 1 results in another integer in the list), `count` is a dictionary containing the counts of the complementary integers that are still present in the list after processing.
