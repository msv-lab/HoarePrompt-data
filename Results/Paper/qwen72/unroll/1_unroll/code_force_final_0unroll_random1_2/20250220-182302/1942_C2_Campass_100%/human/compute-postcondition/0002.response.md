The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer read from input. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, and the list of x integers are distinct and within the range 1 to n**
