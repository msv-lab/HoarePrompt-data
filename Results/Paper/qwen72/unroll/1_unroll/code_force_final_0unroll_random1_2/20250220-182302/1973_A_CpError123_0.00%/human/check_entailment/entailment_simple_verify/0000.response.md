### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The input `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - The input `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) in `cas_de_test`.
   - It calculates the total points `total_points` as \(p1 + p2 + p3\).
   - It checks if the total points are even. If not, it appends -1 to `resultats` and continues to the next tuple.
   - It calculates the total number of matches `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to `resultats` and continues to the next tuple.
   - It calculates the number of draws `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites` is less than 0, it appends -1 to `resultats`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

3. **Key Conditions and Their Validity:**
   - **Total Points Even Check:**
     - This is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game results in either 2 points or 1 point per player in a draw).
   - **Total Matches Check:**
     - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The total number of matches can be greater than 3, and the maximum score `p3` can indeed be greater than the total number of matches. This condition is too restrictive and incorrectly filters out valid cases.
   - **Draws Calculation:**
     - The formula for calculating the number of draws is correct. The number of draws is given by `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, which accounts for the points that could have been earned through wins and subtracts them to find the remaining points that must have been from draws.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Input: (0, 0, 6)**
     - `total_points = 0 + 0 + 6 = 6` (even)
     - `total_matchs = 6 // 2 = 3`
     - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is `True` because `p3 = 6` and `total_matchs = 3`.
     - The program incorrectly returns -1, but this should be a valid case where the maximum number of draws is 3 (since all games could have ended in a draw).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is too restrictive and incorrectly filters out valid cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
