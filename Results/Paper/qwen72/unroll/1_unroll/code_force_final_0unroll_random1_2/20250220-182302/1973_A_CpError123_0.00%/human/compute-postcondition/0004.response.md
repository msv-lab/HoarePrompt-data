The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cas_de_test`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats` which contains integers. Each integer in `resultats` is either -1 or the number of draws calculated based on the conditions in the loop for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). It returns a list `resultats` where each element is either -1 or the number of draws calculated based on specific conditions for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
