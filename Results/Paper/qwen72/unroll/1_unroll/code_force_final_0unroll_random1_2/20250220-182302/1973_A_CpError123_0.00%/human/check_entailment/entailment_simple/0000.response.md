### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input, ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 500] and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with three integers each, where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points (`total_points`) is odd. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - It then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect because:
     - The maximum number of matches is not limited to 3. For example, if all three players played against each other multiple times, the total number of matches could be much higher.
     - The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` in cases where all games are draws.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total_points} - 2 \times (p3 - p2) - 2 \times (p3 - p1)
     \]
   - This formula is intended to account for the points that could be from wins/losses and then subtract them to find the remaining points that could be from draws. However, it is not correctly formulated for all cases.

5. **Final Check**:
   - The program checks if `egalites` is negative. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If `egalites` is non-negative, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is the number of draws.

### Issues:
- The condition `total_matchs > 3` is too restrictive and does not account for the possibility of more than 3 matches.
- The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect because `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` in valid scenarios.
- The formula for calculating `egalites` is not robust enough to handle all valid scenarios.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is **incorrect** for the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
