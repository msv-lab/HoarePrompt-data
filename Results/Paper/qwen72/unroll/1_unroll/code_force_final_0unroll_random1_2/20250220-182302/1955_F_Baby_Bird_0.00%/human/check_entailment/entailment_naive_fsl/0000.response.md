Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input sequence contains an even number of each integer (1, 2, 3, 4) correctly. In such a case, the XOR of all numbers should be zero, meaning Bob wins. However, the program's logic does not correctly account for this scenario. For example, if the input is `0 2 0 2`, the program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because Bob can win twice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
