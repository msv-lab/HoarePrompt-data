Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. However, the problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted, and then the beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
