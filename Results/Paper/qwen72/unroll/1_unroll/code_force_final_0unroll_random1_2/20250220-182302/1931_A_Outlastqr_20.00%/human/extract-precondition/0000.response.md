Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, encoded_words):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and encoded_words is a list of integers where each integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) represents the encoded word for each test case.**
