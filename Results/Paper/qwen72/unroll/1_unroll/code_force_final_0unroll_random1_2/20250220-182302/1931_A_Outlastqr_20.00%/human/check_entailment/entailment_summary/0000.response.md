Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The approach taken by the program is to break down the problem into three cases based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n > 52`**:
   - The program constructs the word by taking the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet and appending 'zz' to it.
   - This is because the maximum sum of the positions of two letters is 52 (26 + 26). Therefore, if `n > 52`, the third letter must be 'z' to maximize the sum, and the second letter must also be 'z' to ensure the lexicographically smallest result. The first letter is then determined by `n - 52`.

2. **If `26 < n ≤ 52`**:
   - The program constructs the word by taking 'a' as the first letter, the character at position `n - 28` as the second letter, and 'z' as the third letter.
   - This is because the maximum sum of the positions of one letter is 26. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the third letter must be 'z' to maximize the sum, and the first letter is 'a' to ensure the lexicographically smallest result. The second letter is then determined by `n - 27`.

3. **If `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`**:
   - The program constructs the word by taking 'aa' as the first two letters and the character at position `n - 3` as the third letter.
   - This is because the smallest possible sum for a three-letter word is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), and if `n` is between 3 and 26, the first two letters must be 'a' to ensure the lexicographically smallest result. The third letter is then determined by `n - 2`.

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided example:

- For `n = 24`:
  - `24 ≤ 26`, so the word is 'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3] = 'aa' + 'v' = 'aav'.
- For `n = 70`:
  - `70 > 52`, so the word is alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = 'r' + 'zz' = 'rzz'.
- For `n = 3`:
  - `3 ≤ 26`, so the word is 'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.
- For `n = 55`:
  - `55 > 52`, so the word is alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz' = 'c' + 'zz' = 'czz'.
- For `n = 48`:
  - `26 < 48 ≤ 52`, so the word is 'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + 'u' + 'z' = 'auz'.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
