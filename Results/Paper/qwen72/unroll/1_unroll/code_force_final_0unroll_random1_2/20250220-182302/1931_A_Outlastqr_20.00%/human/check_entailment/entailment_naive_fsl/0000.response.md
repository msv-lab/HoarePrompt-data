Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

- Input: `n = 48`
- Expected Output: `auz`
- Actual Output: `aaz`

The program constructs the word by appending 'aa' and then the character corresponding to `n - 3`, which results in 'aaz' instead of 'auz'. This is incorrect because 'aaz' does not sum to 48, and 'auz' is the correct lexicographically smallest word that sums to 48.

To correctly handle this, the program should consider the constraints and construct the word by ensuring that the sum of the indices of the characters equals the given `n` while also being lexicographically smallest.
