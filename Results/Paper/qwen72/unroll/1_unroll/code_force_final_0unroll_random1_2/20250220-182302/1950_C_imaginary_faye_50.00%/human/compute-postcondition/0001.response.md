Output State: **The output state is a series of strings, each representing a time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" based on the input times. The variable `time_str` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of times specified by the user.
- For each iteration, the loop reads a new time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
- It then processes the hour part (`h`) of the time string:
  - If `h` is "00", it prints "12" followed by the minute part and "AM".
  - If `h` is between "01" and "12" (inclusive), it prints the hour part as is, followed by the minute part and "AM".
  - If `h` is between "13" and "23" (inclusive), it converts the hour to a 12-hour format by subtracting 12, and prints it followed by the minute part and "PM".
- The variable `time_str` is not modified within the loop, so it remains in its initial state.
