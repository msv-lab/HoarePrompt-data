Reasoning:  
The program is designed to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The logic in the program correctly handles the conversion for both hours and minutes, and it appends "AM" or "PM" appropriately based on the hour value.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then reads each time string in the 24-hour format.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it correctly converts it to `12` and appends "AM".
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it keeps the hour as is and appends "AM".
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and appends "PM".
3. **Minute Handling**: The minutes are directly appended to the output without any modification, which is correct.
4. **Output**: The program correctly formats the output as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" for each test case.

However, there is a minor issue in the program:
- When the hour is between `13` and `23`, the program uses `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` to format the hour. This will add a leading zero to hours 1 to 9, but not to hours 10 to 12. For example, `13:00` will be printed as `01:00 PM`, which is correct, but `22:00` will be printed as `10:00 PM`, which is also correct. However, the leading zero is not necessary for hours 10 to 12 in 12-hour format.

Given that the problem description does not explicitly require the removal of leading zeros for hours 10 to 12, and the output format is still valid, the program can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
