You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different pair of `n` and `m`, and the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads a pair of integers `n` and `m`, and calculates the value of `ans` based on the provided logic. After all iterations, the final values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the variable `ans` will have been printed for each test case, and the variable `count` will have been incremented to `m + 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each of up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^6. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
