### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies that \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer.
   - Simplifying, we get \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)}\).
   - For this to be an integer, \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer, which means \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the number of pairs \((a, 1)\) for \(1 \le a \le n\) since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always divisible by \(1\).
   - It then iterates over `count` from 2 to `m` to consider pairs \((a, b)\) where \(b > 1\).
   - For each `count` (which represents \(b\)), it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor\), which represents the maximum value of \(a\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(a\) is a multiple of `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop because no further valid pairs can be found.
   - It then updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the program attempts to count valid pairs by iterating over possible values of \(b\).
   - However, the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor\) and subsequent operations do not accurately reflect the required condition.
   - Specifically, the update `g -= countmins` and the addition \(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor + 1\) to `ans` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example Verification:
- For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - The program initializes `ans` to 10.
  - It then iterates over `count` from 2 to 8.
  - For `count = 2`, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{2} \right\rfloor = 5\). After `g -= 1`, `g` becomes 4. The addition \(\left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 = 3\) to `ans` results in `ans` being 13.
  - For `count = 3`, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor = 3\). After `g -= 2`, `g` becomes 1. The addition \(\left\lfloor \frac{1}{3} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1\) to `ans` results in `ans` being 14.
  - For `count = 4`, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{4} \right\rfloor = 2\). After `g -= 3`, `g` becomes -1. The loop breaks.
  - The program prints 14, which is incorrect. The correct number of valid pairs is 14, but the logic used to count them is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
