Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 2. According to the problem description, when `n` is 2, the permutation `p` can only be `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and the maximum XOR value is `1` (i.e., `0 ⊕ 1` or `1 ⊕ 0`). However, the program is designed to work with `n` greater than 2, and it does not handle the case where `n` is 2 correctly. Specifically, the first loop that tries to find `k` will not execute because the range `range(2, n)` is empty when `n` is 2. This means that `k` will remain `1`, and the second loop will also not execute, leading to the program potentially outputting incorrect indices. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the case where `n` is 2.
