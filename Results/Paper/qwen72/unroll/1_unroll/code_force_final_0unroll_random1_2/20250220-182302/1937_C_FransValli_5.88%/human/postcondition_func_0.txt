The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it queries the input to find two indices `k` and `best` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_k` and `p_best` is maximized. It prints these indices in the format `! k best` after completing the necessary queries. The function ensures that the total number of queries made for each test case does not exceed 3n, and the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
