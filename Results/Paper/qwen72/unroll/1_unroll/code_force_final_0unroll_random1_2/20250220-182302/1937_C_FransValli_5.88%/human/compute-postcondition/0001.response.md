Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the function has found two indices `k` and `best` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_k` and `p_best` is maximized, and has printed these indices in the format `! k best`. The variables `n` and `k` have been updated for each test case, and `best` has been updated within each test case. The total number of queries made does not exceed 3n for any test case, and the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
