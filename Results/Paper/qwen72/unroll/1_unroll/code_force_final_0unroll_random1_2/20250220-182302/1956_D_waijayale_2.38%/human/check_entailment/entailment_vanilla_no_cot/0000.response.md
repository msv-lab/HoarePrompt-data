Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to set the elements of the array to the MEX of the subarray, but it does not correctly compute the MEX. Instead, it sets the elements to `r - l + 1`, which is the length of the subarray. This is not the correct MEX value.
   - The function also has a recursive call that does not make sense in the context of the problem. It calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, but this does not help in finding the MEX or maximizing the sum.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to return the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves. However, it calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum` which is not defined within the scope of `func_2` and is supposed to be a separate function.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is intended to recursively maximize the sum of the array, but it has several issues:
     - It uses a global variable `a` and `ops` without passing them as arguments, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
     - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not correct for determining when to apply the MEX operation. The MEX operation should be applied to maximize the sum, not based on a comparison with the square of the subarray length.
     - The function sets the elements of the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is incorrect as it does not compute the MEX.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to solve the problem, but it does not correctly handle the output. It prints the sum and the number of operations, but the operations are printed with indices shifted by 1 (which is correct for 1-based indexing, but the function itself uses 0-based indexing).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Compute the MEX of the subarray correctly.
- Apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.
- Ensure that the operations are recorded and printed correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr) + 1):
        if i not in seen:
            return i

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r + 1]
    x = mex(subarray)
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        a[i] = x
    ops.append((l + 1, r + 1))

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    max_sum = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray = a[i:j + 1]
            x = mex(subarray)
            if x > max(subarray):
                max_sum += (j - i + 1) * x
                func_1(a, i, j, ops)
                break

    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l, r)

# Example usage:
# func_3()
```

This corrected version:
- Computes the MEX of the subarray correctly.
- Applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.
- Ensures that the operations are recorded and printed correctly.
