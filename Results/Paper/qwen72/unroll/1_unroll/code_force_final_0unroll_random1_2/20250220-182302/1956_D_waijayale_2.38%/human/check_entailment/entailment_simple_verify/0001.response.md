### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array `a` by performing operations where a subarray is set to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX is the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the base case where `l == r` and to recursively set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If false, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively calls itself for the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Case Handling**:
     - The program correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - **Recursive MEX Setting**:
     - The recursive function `func_1` correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - **Subarray Splitting**:
     - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly splits the array based on the maximum value and recursively maximizes the sum for the subarrays.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The program correctly handles arrays of length 1, as shown in the example where `a = [0]` and the output is `1 1 1 1`.
     - The program correctly handles arrays where the MEX is 0, as shown in the example where `a = [0, 1]` and the output is `4 1 1 2`.
     - The program correctly handles arrays where the MEX is greater than 0, as shown in the example where `a = [1, 3, 9]` and the output is `13 0`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program uses recursion and splits the array based on the maximum value, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5.
   - The depth of recursion is limited by the length of the array, which is at most 18, making the program efficient for the given constraints.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case and recursive MEX setting.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly splits the array and handles the sum comparison.
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input and prints the output in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the base cases, recursive splits, and edge cases appropriately, and it ensures that the number of operations is within the allowed limit.

Final: **True**
