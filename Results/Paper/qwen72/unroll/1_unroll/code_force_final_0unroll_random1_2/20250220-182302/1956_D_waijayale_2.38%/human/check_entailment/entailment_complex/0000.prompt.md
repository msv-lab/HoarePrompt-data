Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a`, two integers `l` and `r` such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and a list `ops` to store tuples of integers representing operations. It modifies the list `a` and appends tuples to `ops` based on certain conditions. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function does not return any value, returning `None` instead. After the function concludes, the list `a` may have some of its elements modified, and the list `ops` may contain tuples representing the operations performed. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers such that 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for all 0 <= i < len(a).

    return sum(a), len(ops), ops
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in list `a`, the length of list `ops` which is 0, and the list `ops` which is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and returns the sum of all integers in `a`, the length of an empty list `ops` (which is 0), and the empty list `ops` itself. The function does not modify the input list `a` or perform any operations that affect the state of the program outside of its scope.

            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.

If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive call is made.

If `s` <= `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` are all set to the value `r - l + 1`, and `l`, `r`, `n`, `ops`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `s` > `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive call is made.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integers `l` and `r` and a list of integers `a`. It modifies the sublist `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements to the value `r - l + 1` if the sum of the elements in this sublist is less than or equal to the square of the sublist's length. Otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist. The function also appends tuples `(l, r)` to the list `ops` when the sublist is modified. The final state of the program is that the list `a` may have been modified, and `ops` contains tuples representing the ranges of sublists that were modified. The function itself does not return a value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_3()`. The function reads `n` and `a` from standard input, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s, m (where s is the sum of all elements in the list a and m is the maximum element in the list a)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from standard input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of all elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum element in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` retain their initial values, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the computation performed by `func_2`.
