Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.** 

The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range 1 to 18. The variable `a` is still expected to be a list of `n` integers, each within the range 0 to 10^7, but it has not been assigned yet.
