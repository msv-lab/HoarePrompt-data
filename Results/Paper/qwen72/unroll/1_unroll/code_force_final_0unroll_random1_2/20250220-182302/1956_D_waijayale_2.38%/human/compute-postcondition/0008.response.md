The code snippet `pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l` calculates the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and then adds `l` to this index to get the position of `mx` in the original list `a`.

- `a[l:r + 1]` is the sublist of `a` from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive).
- `a[l:r + 1].index(mx)` finds the index of `mx` within this sublist.
- Adding `l` to this index gives the position of `mx` in the original list `a`.

Therefore, the variable `pos` is assigned the value of the index of `mx` in the original list `a`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`.**
