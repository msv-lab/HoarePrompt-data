You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integers `l` and `r` and a list of integers `a`. It modifies the sublist `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements to the value `r - l + 1` if the sum of the elements in this sublist is less than or equal to the square of the sublist's length. Otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist. The function also appends tuples `(l, r)` to the list `ops` when the sublist is modified. The final state of the program is that the list `a` may have been modified, and `ops` contains tuples representing the ranges of sublists that were modified. The function itself does not return a value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_3()`. The function reads `n` and `a` from standard input, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from standard input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of all elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum element in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` retain their initial values, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the computation performed by `func_2`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. It simply sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` without ensuring that this is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already optimal (i.e., the sum cannot be increased by any operation). For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program should return the sum as `6` and `0` operations, but it might incorrectly attempt to perform operations.

4. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. It does not correctly split the array and handle the MEX calculation for each segment.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10 0
```

**Actual Output:**
- The program will likely attempt to perform operations and change the array, which is incorrect because the sum of the array is already maximized.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and handle the recursive logic properly. Additionally, it should ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) and that the array is not modified unnecessarily.
