### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where `l == r` and also to recursively set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - **Issue**: The function assumes that the MEX of the subarray `a[l:r]` is always `r - l + 1`, which is incorrect. The MEX could be any value from 0 to `r - l + 1` depending on the elements in the subarray.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Issue**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined with the correct parameters. It should take `a`, `l`, and `r` as arguments.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If false, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively calls itself for the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It assumes that the MEX is always `r - l + 1`, which is not always true. Additionally, the function `func_1` is called with incorrect assumptions about the MEX.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.
     - **Issue**: The function `func_2` is called without passing the array `a` to it, which is a mistake in the function call.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Case**: The program correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - **Recursive Case**: The recursive function `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray, leading to incorrect operations and potentially incorrect final sums.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly due to the incorrect MEX calculation. For example, if the subarray contains all elements from 0 to `r - l`, the MEX should be `r - l + 1`, but the program might set it to a different value.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The program uses recursion and splits the array based on the maximum value, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5. However, the incorrect MEX calculation can lead to suboptimal or incorrect solutions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is the incorrect calculation of the MEX value in the subarray, which leads to incorrect operations and potentially incorrect final sums. The recursive functions also have issues with their parameters and function calls.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
