The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads two inputs from standard input: `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `a`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from standard input, and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `a`.**
