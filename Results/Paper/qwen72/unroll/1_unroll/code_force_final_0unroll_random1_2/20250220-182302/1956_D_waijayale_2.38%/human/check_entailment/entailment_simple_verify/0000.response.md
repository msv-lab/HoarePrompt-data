Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`, the MEX should be `0`, but the program sets it to `3`, which is incorrect.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already optimal (i.e., the sum cannot be increased by any operation). For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program should return the sum as `6` and `0` operations, but it might incorrectly attempt to perform operations.

4. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. It does not correctly split the array and handle the MEX calculation for each segment. The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid criterion for determining whether to perform an operation. The MEX should be calculated for each subarray, and the operation should be performed based on the MEX value.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10 0
```

**Actual Output:**
- The program will likely attempt to perform operations and change the array, which is incorrect because the sum of the array is already maximized.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and handle the recursive logic properly. Additionally, it should ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) and that the array is not modified unnecessarily.

Final: **False**
