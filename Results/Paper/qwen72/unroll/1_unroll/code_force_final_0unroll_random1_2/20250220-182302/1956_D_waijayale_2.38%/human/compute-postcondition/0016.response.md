The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. The array `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function also uses a list `ops` to store operations as tuples (l, r).

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `l` is equal to `r`, the function returns the value of `a[l]`.
- Case_2: If `l` is not equal to `r`, the function returns the maximum of two possible outcomes:
  1. The sum of `a[l]` and the negative of the result of calling `recursive_maximize_sum` with parameters `l+1` and `r`.
  2. The sum of `a[r]` and the negative of the result of calling `recursive_maximize_sum` with parameters `l` and `r-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the maximum possible sum that can be obtained by selecting elements from the subarray `a[l:r+1]` in a way that alternates between adding and subtracting the selected elements, starting with addition.**
