Output State: **The loop iterates `tt` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list `a` of `x` vertices, and calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices. The final result for each test case is printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are reset for each iteration, and `tt` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.**
