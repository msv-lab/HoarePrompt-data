The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the chosen vertices. The final result for each test case is the minimum of the calculated number of triangles and `n - 2`, which is printed to the console. The function does not return any value.
