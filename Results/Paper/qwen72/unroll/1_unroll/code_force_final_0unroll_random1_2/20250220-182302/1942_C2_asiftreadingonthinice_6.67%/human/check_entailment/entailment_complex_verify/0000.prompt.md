You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: The loop iterates `tt` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list `a` of `x` vertices, and calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices. The final result for each test case is printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are reset for each iteration, and `tt` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the chosen vertices. The final result for each test case is the minimum of the calculated number of triangles and `n - 2`, which is printed to the console. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the handling of the circular nature of the polygon. Specifically, the condition for checking the distance between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list `a` is incorrect. The program uses `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` to calculate the distance, but this is not the correct way to handle the circular distance. The correct way to calculate the circular distance between the last and the first vertex should be `n - (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])`.

Additionally, the program incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` in the second part of the condition for the circular distance, which should be `n - (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])`.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output:
5
```

The expected output is 6 because the vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6 can form 4 triangles, and by adding the vertices 3 and 7, we can form 2 more triangles, resulting in a total of 6 triangles. However, the program outputs 5, indicating an error in the logic.
