The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of a lost string, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (0 ≤ a_i < n) represents the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. It is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists at least one valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The function returns a valid string `s` for each test case based on the provided trace.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a valid string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z, based on the trace provided in `a`.**
