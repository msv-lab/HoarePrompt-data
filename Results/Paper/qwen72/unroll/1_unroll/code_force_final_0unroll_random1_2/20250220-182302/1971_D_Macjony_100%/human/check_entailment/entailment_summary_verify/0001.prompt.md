You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input. It then calculates and prints the number of alternating character sequences in `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if the sequence contains a '0' followed by a '1'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the input has been processed for `t` test cases, and the final state of the program includes the printed counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to cut a binary string into the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop with index `j`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic of counting the number of pieces is based on the number of transitions between different characters.
   - However, the logic of decrementing `count` by 1 if there is a '0' to '1' transition is incorrect. This is because the presence of a '0' to '1' transition does not necessarily mean we need to reduce the count of pieces.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of '1's that appear before any '0's in the string, as each such '1' will need to be in a separate piece to ensure the final string is sorted.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Initialize `count` to 1.
   - Iterate through the string and count the number of '1's that appear before any '0'.
   - The final `count` will be the number of such '1's plus 1 (for the remaining part of the string).

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the string "11010":
     - '1' appears before '0' at positions 0, 1, and 3.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces is 3 + 1 = 4, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.
   - For the string "00000000":
     - No '1' appears before any '0'.
     - The program correctly outputs 1.
   - For the string "1":
     - No '0' appears.
     - The program correctly outputs 1.
   - For the string "10":
     - '1' appears before '0'.
     - The program correctly outputs 2.
   - For the string "0001111":
     - No '1' appears before any '0'.
     - The program correctly outputs 1.
   - For the string "0110":
     - '1' appears before '0' at position 1.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces is 1 + 1 = 2, and the program correctly outputs 2.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where '1's appear before '0's correctly. The logic of decrementing `count` by 1 if there is a '0' to '1' transition is flawed.
