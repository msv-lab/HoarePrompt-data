The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, the function accepts a single argument `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a binary string `s` for each test case. It returns the result for each test case based on the binary string `s`.**
