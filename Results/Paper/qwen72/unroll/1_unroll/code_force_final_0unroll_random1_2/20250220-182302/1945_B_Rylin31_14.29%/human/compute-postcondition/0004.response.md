Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints the result of `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no values are returned. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the output that has been printed for each test case. **
