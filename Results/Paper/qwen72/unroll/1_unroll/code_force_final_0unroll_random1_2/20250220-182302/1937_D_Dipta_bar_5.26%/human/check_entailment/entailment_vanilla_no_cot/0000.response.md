Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is quite complex and contains several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Usage of `A` and `B` Arrays:**
   - The arrays `A` and `B` are supposed to store the cumulative number of steps it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively. However, the way they are initialized and updated in the program is not correct. The logic for calculating the steps is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Pinball Movement:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of steps by using a combination of `A` and `B` arrays, but the logic for determining the steps is overly complicated and does not correctly reflect the movement rules of the pinball. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the inversion of the direction after each move.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem description. The program should print the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell in a single line for each test case. However, the program's output logic is convoluted and does not produce the correct results.

### Correct Approach:
A simpler and more correct approach to solve this problem is to precompute the number of steps it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    
    # Precompute the number of steps to the left and right
    left_steps = [0] * n
    right_steps = [0] * n
    
    # Compute left_steps
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '<':
            count += 1
        left_steps[i] = count
    
    # Compute right_steps
    count = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '>':
            count += 1
        right_steps[i] = count
    
    # Answer the queries
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '>':
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            print(i + 1, end=' ')
    
    print()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Precompute `left_steps` and `right_steps`:**
   - `left_steps[i]` stores the number of '<' characters from the start to the i-th cell.
   - `right_steps[i]` stores the number of '>' characters from the i-th cell to the end.

2. **Answer the Queries:**
   - If the character at the i-th cell is '>', the pinball will move to the right and leave the grid in `n - i` seconds.
   - If the character at the i-th cell is '<', the pinball will move to the left and leave the grid in `i + 1` seconds.

This approach is much simpler and correctly handles the problem's requirements.
