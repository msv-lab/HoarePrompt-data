Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'. For example, consider the input where `s` is ">>>>" or "<<<<". In such cases, the pinball should move in a single direction until it leaves the grid. However, the program's logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and may not handle these edge cases correctly.

For a more concrete example, let's consider the input:
```
1
4
<<<<
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2 3 4
```
However, the program's logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball may not produce this output correctly due to the way it calculates the time for each cell. Specifically, the program's handling of the `A` and `B` arrays and their indices may not work as intended for such simple, uniform cases.
