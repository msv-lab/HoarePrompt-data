To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop step-by-step and understand how the variables `B` and `idx_B` are updated.

### Initial State:
- `A` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to each position where a '>' character is found.
- `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)
```

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
- For each iteration, `i` is set to `n - 1 - j`, which means `i` starts from the last index of `s` and moves backwards.
- If `s[i]` is '<', the loop updates `B` and `idx_B`:
  - If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is appended with `0`.
  - Otherwise, `B` is appended with a value calculated based on the last element in `B` and the last element in `idx_B`.
  - `idx_B` is then appended with the current index `i`.

### Final Output State:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `idx_A` remains unchanged.
- `B` will contain the cumulative counts of '<' characters from the end of the string `s` up to each position where a '<' character is found.
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`.

### Example:
Let's consider a string `s = ">>><<>"` and `n = 7`.

- `A` and `idx_A` are not affected by the loop.
- `B` and `idx_B` will be updated as follows:
  - `i = 6` (last character is '>'), no update to `B` or `idx_B`.
  - `i = 5` (character is '<'), `B` becomes `[0]`, `idx_B` becomes `[5]`.
  - `i = 4` (character is '<'), `x = 0 + (5 - 4) * 1 = 1`, `B` becomes `[0, 1]`, `idx_B` becomes `[5, 4]`.
  - `i = 3` (character is '>'), no update to `B` or `idx_B`.
  - `i = 2` (character is '>'), no update to `B` or `idx_B`.
  - `i = 1` (character is '>'), no update to `B` or `idx_B`.
  - `i = 0` (character is '>'), no update to `B` or `idx_B`.

### Final Output State:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `idx_A` remains unchanged.
- `B` is `[0, 1]`.
- `idx_B` is `[5, 4]`.

Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `B` is `[0, 1]`, `idx_B` is `[5, 4]`.**
