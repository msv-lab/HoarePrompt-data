### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes two lists `A` and `idx_A` to keep track of the cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - Similarly, it initializes two lists `B` and `idx_B` to keep track of the cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
   - **Processing '>' Characters**:
     - The first loop iterates over the string from left to right.
     - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters up to the current position and appends it to `A`.
     - It also appends the index of the current '>' character to `idx_A`.
   - **Processing '<' Characters**:
     - The second loop iterates over the string from right to left.
     - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters from the current position to the end and appends it to `B`.
     - It also appends the index of the current '<' character to `idx_B`.
   - **Calculating and Printing Results**:
     - The third loop iterates over the string from left to right.
     - For each character, it determines the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative counts and indices stored in `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B`.
     - The logic for calculating the number of seconds is complex but follows the rules of the problem:
       - If the current character is '>', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts of '>' characters to the left and '<' characters to the right.
       - If the current character is '<', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts of '<' characters to the right and '>' characters to the left.
     - The results are printed in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, ensuring that the input string length `n` is within the specified range.
   - It correctly processes strings with only '<' or only '>' characters, as well as strings with a mix of both characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case in the required format, with each result separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules and constraints. The intermediate states and the final output match the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
