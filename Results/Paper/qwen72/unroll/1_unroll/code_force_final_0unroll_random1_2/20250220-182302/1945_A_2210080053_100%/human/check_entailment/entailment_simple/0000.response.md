### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how it handles the problem of accommodating introverts, extroverts, and universals in tents according to their preferences.

1. **Introverts (a):**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is simply `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b):**
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus any additional tents needed for the remaining extroverts. If `b % 3` is non-zero, we need an additional tent to accommodate the remaining extroverts.

3. **Universals (c):**
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.

### Program Analysis:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads from a file (standard input) and processes each line starting from the second line. Each line contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

- **Tent Calculation:**
  - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is done to account for the flexibility of universals in filling the remaining spots in tents with extroverts.
  - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the formula `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

### Formula Explanation:

- **`- -b // 3`**:
  - The expression `- -b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3` because the double negation cancels out. This calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
  - The total number of tents needed is then `a + b // 3`.

- **`c < b % 3`**:
  - This condition checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If `c` is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Case 1: `1 2 3`**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent, and 1 universal can fill the remaining spot.
  - Universals: 2 universals left, which can form 1 tent.
  - Total tents: 3 (Correct)

- **Case 2: `1 4 1`**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spot in the second tent.
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Case 3: `1 4 2`**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 2`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, and 2 universals can fill the remaining spots.
  - Total tents: 3 (Correct)

- **Case 4: `1 1 1`**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining 2 spots.
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Case 5: `1 3 2`**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and 2 universals can fill the remaining spots.
  - Total tents: 3 (Correct)

- **Case 6: `19 7 18`**
  - `a = 19`, `b = 7`, `c = 18`
  - Introverts: 19 tents
  - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 3 tents, and 18 universals can fill the remaining spots.
  - Total tents: 28 (Correct)

- **Case 7: `0 0 0`**
  - `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
  - No participants, so no tents needed.
  - Total tents: 0 (Correct)

- **Case 8: `7 0 0`**
  - `a = 7`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
  - Introverts: 7 tents
  - No extroverts or universals.
  - Total tents: 7 (Correct)

- **Case 9: `0 24 0`**
  - `a = 0`, `b = 24`, `c = 0`
  - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
  - No universals to fill the remaining spots.
  - Total tents: 8 (Correct)

- **Case 10: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`**
  - `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`, `c = 1000000000`
  - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
  - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333333 tents, and 1000000000 universals can fill the remaining spots.
  - Total tents: 1666666667 (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases provided. It respects the constraints and preferences of the participants, and it outputs the minimum number of tents or `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
**True**
