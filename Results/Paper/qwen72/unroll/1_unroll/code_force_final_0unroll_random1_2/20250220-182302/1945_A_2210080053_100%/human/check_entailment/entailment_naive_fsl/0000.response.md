Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal. The introvert needs a tent alone, which is fine. However, the extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, and there is only one universal left. This means it is impossible to fulfill the extrovert's requirement, and the output should be -1. The program, however, outputs 1, which is incorrect.
