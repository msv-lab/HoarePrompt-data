Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It then calculates the sum of the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th smallest elements of the list and prints this sum. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `t`, `n`, and the list of integers have been consumed, and the specified sums have been printed for each test case. **
