Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers. Sorting is crucial because it allows us to always pick the smallest available number in each pair, which maximizes the score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number in each pair to the score. This ensures that we are always adding the minimum of each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

The logic of the program ensures that it will always produce the maximum possible score for any valid input, as it always pairs the smallest available numbers first. This is the optimal strategy for the problem described. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
