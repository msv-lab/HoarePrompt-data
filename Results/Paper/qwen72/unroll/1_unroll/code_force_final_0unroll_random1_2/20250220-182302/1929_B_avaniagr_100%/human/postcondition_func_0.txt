The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n` x `n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value. After processing all input lines, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `k` are not retained.
