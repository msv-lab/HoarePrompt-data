Output State: **The loop has processed all the input lines from the standard input, and for each line, it has printed the minimum number of cells to color based on the given conditions. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration, but they are not retained after the loop finishes. The function `min_cells_to_color` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.**
