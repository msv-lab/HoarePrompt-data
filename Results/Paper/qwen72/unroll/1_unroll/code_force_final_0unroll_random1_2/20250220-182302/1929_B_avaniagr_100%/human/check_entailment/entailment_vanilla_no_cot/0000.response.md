Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input from standard input, which is expected to contain multiple test cases. The first line of input is the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program splits the line into `n` and `k` and processes them.

3. **Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, you can color cells in such a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover `k` diagonals, you need at least `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells.
   - **Case 2**: If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, the program prints `2 * n - 1`. This is correct because to cover `4 * n - 3` diagonals, you need to color cells in a way that covers all but one diagonal. The optimal way to do this is to color all cells in one row and one column, which results in `2 * n - 1` cells.
   - **Case 3**: If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the program prints `2 * n`. This is correct because to cover all `4 * n - 2` diagonals, you need to color all cells in one row and one column, which results in `2 * n` cells.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
