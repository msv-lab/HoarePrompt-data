#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all the input lines from the standard input, and for each line, it has printed the minimum number of cells to color based on the given conditions. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration, but they are not retained after the loop finishes. The function `min_cells_to_color` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n` x `n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value. After processing all input lines, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `k` are not retained.
