#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement, which is `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each test case, and `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.
