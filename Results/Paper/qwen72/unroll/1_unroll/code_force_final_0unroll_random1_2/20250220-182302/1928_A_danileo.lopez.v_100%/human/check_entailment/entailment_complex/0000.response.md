Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by cutting it into two rectangles and then reassembling them. The key logic in the function is to check if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If one of the dimensions is even, the rectangle can be cut into two equal parts along that dimension. The function then checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can be reassembled into a new rectangle that is different from the original one (ignoring rotations).

1. **Even Dimension Check**:
   - If \(a\) is even, the function cuts the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \(b\) is even, the function cuts the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - The function then checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original \(a \times b\) rectangle (ignoring rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - For the cut along \(a\): The new rectangle would be \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \). This is different from the original if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \).
   - For the cut along \(b\): The new rectangle would be \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \). This is different from the original if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no cut can produce a new rectangle because both resulting rectangles will have odd dimensions, and they cannot be reassembled into a different rectangle.
   - If \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the function correctly identifies that no new rectangle can be formed because cutting a 1xN rectangle will always result in 1x1 rectangles, which can only form the original rectangle or its rotation.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints "Yes" if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The function prints "No" if no new rectangle can be formed.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the function, the function correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
