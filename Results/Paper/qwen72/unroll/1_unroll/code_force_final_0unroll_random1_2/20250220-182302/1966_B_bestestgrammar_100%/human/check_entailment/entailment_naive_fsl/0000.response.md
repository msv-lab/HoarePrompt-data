Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grid can be made uniform (all squares the same color) but the initial check fails. Specifically, the program checks if the corners of the grid are the same color and if the entire first row and last row, or the entire first column and last column, are the same color. However, this does not cover all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
In this grid, the corners are not the same color, and neither the first row nor the last row, nor the first column nor the last column, are entirely the same color. However, it is possible to make the entire grid white by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'W') and performing the operation, which will turn the entire grid white. The program would incorrectly output "NO" for this case.
