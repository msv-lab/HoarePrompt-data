Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the state corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.**
