You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row in the grid and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    t = int(input())

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the state corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string in the grid represents a row and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid itself. It then checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same character. If they are different, it further checks if any row or column has all the same characters. If any row or column has all the same characters, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the variable `t` remains unchanged, while the variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` reflect the state of the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program starts by assuming that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, setting `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Edge Case Check:**
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there are any adjacent squares in the top row or bottom row, or in the leftmost column or rightmost column, that are different colors.
   - If all adjacent squares in the top row and bottom row are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - Similarly, if all adjacent squares in the leftmost column and rightmost column are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the only way to make the entire grid the same color is if all adjacent squares in the top and bottom rows, and all adjacent squares in the leftmost and rightmost columns, are the same color.
   - This is because any operation that changes the color of a square must involve two squares of the same color, and if the top and bottom rows or the left and right columns are uniform, it is impossible to change the color of the entire grid to a single color.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `ans`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid is already uniform.
- It also correctly identifies the cases where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors and the adjacent squares in the top and bottom rows, or the left and right columns, are uniform.
- However, the program does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation. It only checks the specific edge cases mentioned.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the first test case (2x1 grid with 'W' and 'B'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
- For the second test case (6x6 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform as shown in the problem description.
- For the third and fourth test cases (1x1 and 2x2 uniform grids), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
- For the fifth test case (3x4 grid with a checkerboard pattern), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
- For the sixth test case (4x2 grid with two uniform rows), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
- For the seventh test case (4x4 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
- For the eighth test case (1x5 grid with 'WBBWB'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it only checks specific edge cases and does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation. Therefore, the program may fail for some valid inputs where the grid can be made uniform but does not meet the specific edge case conditions.

Correctness: **False**
