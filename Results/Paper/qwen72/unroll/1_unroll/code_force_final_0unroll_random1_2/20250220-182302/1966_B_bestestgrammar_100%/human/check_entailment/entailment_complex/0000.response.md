Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an n Ã— m grid the same color using the specified operations. The function processes multiple test cases and checks the following conditions:

1. **Initial Check**: It first checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`) of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it proceeds to further checks.
2. **Row and Column Checks**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, it checks if any row or column has all the same characters. If any row or column has all the same characters, it sets the answer to 'NO' because it is impossible to change the color of the entire grid if there is a row or column with all the same characters and the corners are different.
3. **Final Output**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, or if the row and column checks do not trigger the 'NO' condition, it prints 'YES'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the function. The function incorrectly sets the answer to 'NO' if any row or column has all the same characters, which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and there is no row or column that is entirely the same color, then the answer should be 'NO'. If any row or column has all the same characters, it should not automatically set the answer to 'NO'.

### Corrected Logic:
- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, the answer is 'YES' because you can always make the entire grid that color.
- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, the function should check if there is any row or column that is entirely the same color. If such a row or column exists, the answer is 'NO' because you cannot change the color of the entire grid if there is a row or column with all the same characters and the corners are different. Otherwise, the answer is 'YES'.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
                continue  # Skip further checks if already determined to be 'NO'
            
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Flaw:
- The original function sets `ans` to 'NO' if any row or column has all the same characters, which is incorrect. It should only set `ans` to 'NO' if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different and there is no row or column that can be used to change the color of the entire grid.

### Conclusion:
The original function is **incorrect** because it does not handle the row and column checks correctly. The corrected function should only set `ans` to 'NO' if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different and there is no row or column that is entirely the same color.

Correctness: **False**
