The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row in the grid and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
