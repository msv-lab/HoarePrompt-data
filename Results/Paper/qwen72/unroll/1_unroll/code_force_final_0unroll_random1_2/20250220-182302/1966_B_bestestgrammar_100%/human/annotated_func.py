#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row in the grid and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the state corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string in the grid represents a row and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid itself. It then checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same character. If they are different, it further checks if any row or column has all the same characters. If any row or column has all the same characters, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the variable `t` remains unchanged, while the variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` reflect the state of the last test case processed.
