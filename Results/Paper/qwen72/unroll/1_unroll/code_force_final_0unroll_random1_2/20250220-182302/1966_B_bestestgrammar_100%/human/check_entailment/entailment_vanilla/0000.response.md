### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program starts by assuming that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, setting `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Edge Case Check:**
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there are any adjacent squares in the top row or bottom row, or in the leftmost column or rightmost column, that are different colors.
   - If all adjacent squares in the top row and bottom row are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - Similarly, if all adjacent squares in the leftmost column and rightmost column are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the only way to make the entire grid the same color is if all adjacent squares in the top and bottom rows, and all adjacent squares in the leftmost and rightmost columns, are the same color.
   - This is because any operation that changes the color of a square must involve two squares of the same color, and if the top and bottom rows or the left and right columns are uniform, it is impossible to change the color of the entire grid to a single color.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `ans`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid is already uniform.
- It also correctly identifies the cases where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors and the adjacent squares in the top and bottom rows, or the left and right columns, are uniform.
- However, the program does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation. It only checks the specific edge cases mentioned.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the first test case (2x1 grid with 'W' and 'B'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
- For the second test case (6x6 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform as shown in the problem description.
- For the third and fourth test cases (1x1 and 2x2 uniform grids), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
- For the fifth test case (3x4 grid with a checkerboard pattern), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
- For the sixth test case (4x2 grid with two uniform rows), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
- For the seventh test case (4x4 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
- For the eighth test case (1x5 grid with 'WBBWB'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it only checks specific edge cases and does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation. Therefore, the program may fail for some valid inputs where the grid can be made uniform but does not meet the specific edge case conditions.

Correctness: **False**
