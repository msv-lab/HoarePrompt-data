The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` is not provided in the question. Therefore, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
