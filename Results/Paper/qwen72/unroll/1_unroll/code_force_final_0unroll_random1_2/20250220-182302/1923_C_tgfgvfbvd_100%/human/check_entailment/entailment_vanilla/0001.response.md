### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.
   - It initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c` with an initial value of 0.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Populating Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program iterates through the array `l` and updates the prefix sum arrays:
     - `i` is the running sum of the elements in `l`.
     - `j` is the running count of the number of 1s in `l`.
     - `p` is updated to store the cumulative sum of elements.
     - `c` is updated to store the cumulative count of 1s.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` of the subarray.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix count array `c`.
   - The program then checks if the subarray is good using the condition:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.

5. **Condition Explanation**:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` can be broken down:
     - `s` is the sum of the subarray.
     - `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
     - `s - (b - a + 1)` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
     - `i` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - This condition ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to allow for the transformation of each element in the subarray to a different positive integer while maintaining the same total sum.

6. **Output**:
   - If the subarray meets the conditions, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the input and initializes the prefix sum arrays.
- The query processing logic is correct and efficiently checks the conditions for a good subarray.
- The conditions used in the query processing ensure that the subarray can be transformed to meet the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
