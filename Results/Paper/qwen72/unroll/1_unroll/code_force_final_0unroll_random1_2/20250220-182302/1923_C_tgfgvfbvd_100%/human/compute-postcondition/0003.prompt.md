You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of `q` queries, each query being a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function should also handle the constraints that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates over multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes an array `c` and a list of queries. After processing all the queries for a test case, the loop moves to the next test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are updated within the loop, but their final values at the end of the loop depend on the specific input for each test case. The output state of these variables is not predictable without the actual input data. However, the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an array `c` of positive integers and a list of queries `q`. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`. The function processes multiple test cases and returns the result of an operation on the subarray `c[l_i-1:r_i]` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
