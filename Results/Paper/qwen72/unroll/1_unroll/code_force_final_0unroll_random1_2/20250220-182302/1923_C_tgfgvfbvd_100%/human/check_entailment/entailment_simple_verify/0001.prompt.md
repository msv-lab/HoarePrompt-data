You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of `q` queries, each query being a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function should also handle the constraints that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates over multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes an array `c` and a list of queries. After processing all the queries for a test case, the loop moves to the next test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are updated within the loop, but their final values at the end of the loop depend on the specific input for each test case. The output state of these variables is not predictable without the actual input data. However, the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.
   - It initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c` with an initial value of 0.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Populating Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program iterates through the array `l` and updates the prefix sum arrays:
     - `i` is the running sum of the elements in `l`.
     - `j` is the running count of the number of 1s in `l`.
     - `p` is updated to store the cumulative sum of elements.
     - `c` is updated to store the cumulative count of 1s.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` of the subarray.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix count array `c`.
   - The program then checks if the subarray is good using the condition:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.

5. **Condition Explanation**:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` can be broken down:
     - `s` is the sum of the subarray.
     - `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
     - `s - (b - a + 1)` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
     - `i` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - This condition ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to allow for the transformation of each element in the subarray to a different positive integer while maintaining the same total sum.

6. **Output**:
   - If the subarray meets the conditions, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the input and initializes the prefix sum arrays.
- The query processing logic is correct and efficiently checks the conditions for a good subarray.
- The conditions used in the query processing ensure that the subarray can be transformed to meet the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
