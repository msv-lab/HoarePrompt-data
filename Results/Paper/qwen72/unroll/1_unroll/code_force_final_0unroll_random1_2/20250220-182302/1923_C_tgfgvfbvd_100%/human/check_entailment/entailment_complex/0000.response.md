### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of positive integers.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The function initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
     - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The function iterates over the array `l` and updates the prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `i` is the running sum of the array elements.
     - `j` is the running count of the number of 1s in the array.
     - `p.append(i)` and `c.append(j)` are used to store the prefix sums and counts, respectively.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the indices `a` and `b` and calculates:
     - `i` as the count of 1s in the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the prefix count array `c`.
     - `s` as the sum of the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - The function then checks if the subarray is good based on the conditions:
     - The subarray must contain more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray must be greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

5. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** \(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i\)
  - This condition is implicitly checked by the sum of the subarray `s` and the length of the subarray `b - a + 1`.
  - The sum of the subarray `s` must be equal to the sum of the corresponding `b` array, which is not directly checked but is implied by the construction of `b`.

- **Condition 2:** \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
  - This condition is checked by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.
  - If the subarray contains more than one element and the sum minus the length is at least the count of 1s, it means there are enough elements to construct a `b` array where each element is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

- **Condition 3:** \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
  - This condition is implicitly satisfied because the elements of `b` are constructed to be positive integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input and prints the correct output for each query based on the given conditions. The logic and the conditions are implemented correctly.
