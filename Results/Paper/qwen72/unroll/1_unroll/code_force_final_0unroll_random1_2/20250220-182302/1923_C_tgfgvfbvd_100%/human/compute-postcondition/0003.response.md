Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `l` of positive integers and a list of queries `q`, where each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`. The function then computes and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions: if the subarray `l[l_i-1:r_i]` contains more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the final state of the program is that all queries for all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
