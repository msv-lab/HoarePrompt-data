Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no permutation of the scenarios should have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The logic in the program for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed. It does not ensure that the sequence of transition videos will meet the requirement for all permutations of the scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
.?????
??.???
???.???
????.??
?????.
```

The program will output:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.FF
FFF.F
FFFF.
```

However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the sequence of transition videos will be F, F, F, F, which is 4 funny videos in a row. Since \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\), this is allowed. But if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, the sequence of transition videos will be F, F, F, F, which is also 4 funny videos in a row. This means the program does not ensure that the requirement is met for all possible permutations of the scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
