Postcondition: ***`xx` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` retain their counts of 'F' and 'S' characters, `sa` contains indices of rows with at least one 'F' and no 'S' in the corresponding column, and `sb` contains indices of columns with at least one 'S' and no 'F' in the corresponding row. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the `xx` matrix is modified such that for each row `i` and column `j` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is replaced with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, the character is replaced with 'S'. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the `xx` matrix is modified such that for each row `i` and column `j` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is replaced with 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`. Otherwise, the character is replaced with 'F'.***
