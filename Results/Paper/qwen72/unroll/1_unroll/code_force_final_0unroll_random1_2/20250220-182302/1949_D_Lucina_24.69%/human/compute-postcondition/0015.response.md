Output State: **The `xx` matrix is modified such that for each row `i` and column `j` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is replaced with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, the character is replaced with 'S'. The variables `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.**
