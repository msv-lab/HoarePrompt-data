### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing a string of `n` characters (either `0` or `1`).

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function maintains a list `k` to store the count of `1`s in each row that contains at least one `1`.
   - It iterates through each row and appends the count of `1`s to the list `k` if the row contains any `1`s.

3. **Shape Determination**:
   - The function checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE" because the first and second rows of a square will have the same number of `1`s.
   - If they are not equal, it prints "TRIANGLE" because the first and second rows of a triangle will have different numbers of `1`s.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Shape Check**:
  - The function only checks the first two rows of the grid. This is not sufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid.
  - For a triangle, the number of `1`s should increase or decrease by 2 for each subsequent row (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7 for a triangle with `k=4`).
  - For a square, all rows should have the same number of `1`s.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle edge cases where the shape might be an upside-down triangle or a square that is not aligned with the grid's edges.

### Correctness:
- The provided program is **incorrect** because it only checks the first two rows and does not verify the entire shape. This can lead to incorrect results for grids where the shape is not aligned with the first two rows or where the shape is an upside-down triangle.

### Correctness: **False**
