Output State: **The loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case based on the input grid, and the variable `a` will be decremented by the number of iterations it has completed. The variable `k` will be reset to an empty list at the beginning of each iteration. The input grid and other variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.**
