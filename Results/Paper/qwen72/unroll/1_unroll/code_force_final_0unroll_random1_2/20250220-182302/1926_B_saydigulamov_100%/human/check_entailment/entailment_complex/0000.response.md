Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to determine whether a given grid of '0's and '1's forms a square or a triangle. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The function reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row.
   - It reads the grid size `n` from the input.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - If a row contains at least one '1', it appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - After reading all rows, it checks if the first two elements in the list `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - If they are not equal, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Shape Determination:**
   - The function assumes that if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, the shape is a square. This is a valid assumption for the given problem because a square has the same number of '1's in each row, and a triangle does not.
   - However, the function does not check if the entire grid forms a valid square or triangle. It only checks the first two rows. This could lead to incorrect results if the grid is not consistent with the shape determined by the first two rows.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle the case where the grid might be an upside-down triangle. For example, in the grid:
     ```
     0000
     0100
     1110
     1110
     ```
     The function would incorrectly identify this as a square because the first two rows have the same number of '1's.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - The function assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem description. It does not include any checks for invalid input, such as rows with different lengths or characters other than '0' and '1'.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it only checks the first two rows to determine the shape, which is insufficient to ensure that the entire grid forms a valid square or triangle. It also does not handle the case of an upside-down triangle correctly.

Correctness: **False**
