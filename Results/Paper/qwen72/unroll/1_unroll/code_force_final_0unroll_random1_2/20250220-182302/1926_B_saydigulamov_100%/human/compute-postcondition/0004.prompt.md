You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described, but the function definition itself does not explicitly take any parameters. The input context should include a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then n lines of n characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case based on the input grid, and the variable `a` will be decremented by the number of iterations it has completed. The variable `k` will be reset to an empty list at the beginning of each iteration. The input grid and other variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of '0's and '1's, and returns the shape ("triangle" or "square") found in each grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
