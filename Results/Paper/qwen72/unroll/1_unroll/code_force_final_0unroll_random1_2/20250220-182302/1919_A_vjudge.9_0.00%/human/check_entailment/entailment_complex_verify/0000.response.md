Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(a, b)` does not fully capture the strategic nature of the game as described in the problem. The function simply checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, which is a simplification that does not consider the sequence of moves and the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

However, the original assessment provides an incorrect example to challenge the correctness of `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the example:

- **Example with `a = 2` and `b = 2`:**
  - Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob starts with 2 coins.
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, but it doesn't change the number of coins in either wallet.
  - Alice then removes 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
  - Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
  - Bob then removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
  - Alice can now remove 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin.
  - Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

This example is indeed correct, and it shows that `func_1(2, 2)` should return 'Alice'. However, the function `func_1` returns 'Bob' in this case, which is incorrect.

To further validate the function, let's consider the general logic:
- If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the game will end in a state where both players have an even number of coins, and the player who starts (Alice) will always be the one to make the last move, leading to a win for Bob.
- If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the game will end in a state where one player has an odd number of coins and the other has an even number of coins. The player who starts (Alice) will always be the one to make the last move, leading to a win for Alice.

This logic is based on the fact that each player must always remove 1 coin from their wallet, and the game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., when their wallet is empty). The key point is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins determines the winner because the game is symmetric and both players play optimally.

However, the original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. For instance, the function fails in the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`, as shown in the example.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
