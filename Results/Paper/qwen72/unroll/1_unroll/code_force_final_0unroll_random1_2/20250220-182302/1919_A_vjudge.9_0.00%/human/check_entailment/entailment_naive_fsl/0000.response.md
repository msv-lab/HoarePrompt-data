Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this logic does not correctly handle all cases of the game. Specifically, the game's rules involve players making strategic decisions to swap wallets and remove coins, which can lead to different outcomes depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
- Alice and Bob both have 2 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, but it doesn't change the number of coins in either wallet.
- Alice then removes 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
- Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Bob then removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
- Alice can now remove 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin.
- Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the function `func_1(2, 2)` returns 'Bob', which is incorrect based on the game's rules and the example above. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
