The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n`, `N`, and `pd` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, and it starts from 0 by default.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
