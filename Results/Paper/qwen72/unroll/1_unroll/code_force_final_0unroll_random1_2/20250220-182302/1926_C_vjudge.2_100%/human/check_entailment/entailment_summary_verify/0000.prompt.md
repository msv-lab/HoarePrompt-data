You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. It then precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all previous elements in the list plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function reads another integer `n` from the user and prints the value of `pd[n]`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the list `pd` and the integer `N` (which is 200001) remain in their final computed states. The integer `t` remains the same as the initial input, and `n` is the last input value provided by the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in a list `pd`. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that the program can handle up to \(10^4\) test cases efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step is done only once, and each test case is handled in constant time by simply accessing the precomputed value. The logic for summing the digits and storing the cumulative sum is correct, and the program handles the edge cases (like `n = 1`, `n = 2`, etc.) as expected. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
