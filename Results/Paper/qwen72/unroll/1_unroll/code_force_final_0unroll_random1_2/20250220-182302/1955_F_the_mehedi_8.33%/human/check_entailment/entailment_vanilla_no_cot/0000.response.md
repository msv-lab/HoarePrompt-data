Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Here's why:

1. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the initial XOR of the sequence.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is crucial to determine the winning condition for Alice and Bob.

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - The program does not implement a strategy to remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The XOR of the sequence changes as numbers are removed, and the optimal strategy involves carefully choosing which numbers to remove to ensure the XOR remains zero as often as possible.

3. **Incorrect Counting**:
   - The program adds 1 to `cnt` if `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`. This condition is not directly related to the XOR of the sequence.
   - The program then adds `math.floor(x / 2)` for each `x` in `a` to `cnt`. This is also not a correct way to determine the number of times Bob can win.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the initial XOR of the sequence.
2. Determine the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
3. Count the number of times Bob wins based on the optimal strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_bob_wins():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3]
        xor_sum = a[0] + a[2]  # XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, and 2 and 4 are 0 and 4 respectively

        # If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins the first game
        if xor_sum % 2 == 0:
            bob_wins = (total // 2)
        else:
            bob_wins = (total - 1) // 2

        print(bob_wins)

max_bob_wins()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - The initial XOR of the sequence is calculated as `a[0] + a[2]` because:
     - `1 ^ 1 = 0`, `3 ^ 3 = 0`, `1 ^ 3 = 2`, and `2 ^ 4 = 6` (but since 2 and 4 are even, they do not affect the parity of the XOR sum).

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins the first game. After each removal, the XOR of the remaining sequence should be checked to see if it remains zero.
   - If the initial XOR is non-zero, Bob can only win if the sequence length is odd, and the optimal strategy involves removing numbers to make the sequence length even as often as possible.

3. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - The number of times Bob can win is determined by the total number of elements and the initial XOR. If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins half the games. If the initial XOR is non-zero, Bob wins half the games minus one.

This corrected program should correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
