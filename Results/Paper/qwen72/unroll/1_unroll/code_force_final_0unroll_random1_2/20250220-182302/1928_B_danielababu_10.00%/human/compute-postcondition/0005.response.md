Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element to the first.**

To break this down:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` from the current position to the end of the list.
- `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, but it is not returned by the program.
- The program returns `ans`, which is the list of cumulative products from the last element to the first.
