### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation of the same length to the array. The provided code snippet and functions need to be analyzed to see if they correctly solve this problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It then reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which returns a list of integers.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program finds the maximum element `m` in the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new list `new` where each element is `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - The new list `new` is sorted.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list `new` and adds elements to a set `ans` if they are within the range `[1, n]`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the set `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Element:**
     - The maximum element `m` is found using `max(arr)`. This is correct as it identifies the largest element in the array.
   - **Creating the New List:**
     - The new list `new` is created by transforming each element `arr[i]` to `m - arr[i] + 1`. This transformation is based on the idea that adding a permutation element `p_i` to `arr[i]` should result in a value within the range `[1, n]`.
   - **Sorting the New List:**
     - Sorting `new` is necessary to ensure that we can easily check for unique elements within the range `[1, n]`.
   - **Counting Unique Elements:**
     - The program uses a set `ans` to count unique elements in `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`. This is correct because a set automatically handles duplicates and only keeps unique elements.
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the length of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `2`, `1 2`
     - `m = 2`
     - `new = [2, 1]`
     - `ans = {1, 2}`
     - Output: `2` (Correct)
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `4`, `7 1 4 1`
     - `m = 7`
     - `new = [1, 7, 4, 7]` (after transformation)
     - `ans = {1, 4, 7}`
     - Output: `3` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it counts the unique elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. Specifically, the transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` and the use of a set to count unique elements do not correctly solve the problem. The correct approach should involve checking the frequency of the transformed elements and ensuring that the permutation can be used to achieve the maximum frequency.
