Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` to `func_7` are input handling functions, and `func_8` and `func_9` are for calculating the product of elements in an array, which is irrelevant to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

To solve the problem, you would need a function that:
1. Reads the input for the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determines the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation to the array.
4. Outputs the result for each test case.

The provided functions do not perform these tasks. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
