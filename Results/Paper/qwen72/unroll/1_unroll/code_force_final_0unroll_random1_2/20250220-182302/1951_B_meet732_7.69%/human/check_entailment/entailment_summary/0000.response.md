Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win, given that we can swap its position with another cow once or do nothing. The program attempts to solve this by identifying the positions of cows with higher ratings than cow `k` and then deciding the optimal number of matches cow `k` can win based on these positions.

Let's break down the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `x` is the rating of cow `k`.
   - `ind` is a list to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - `c` is a counter to track the number of such cows.

2. **Identifying Higher Ratings**:
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and appends the indices of cows with ratings greater than `x` to `ind`.
   - The loop breaks if it finds two such cows (i.e., `c == 2`).

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - **No higher ratings** (`ind == []`):
     - If no cow has a higher rating than `x`, cow `k` can win all `n - 1` matches.
   - **One higher rating** (`len(ind) == 1`):
     - If the higher-rated cow is at index 0, cow `k` can win `k - 1` matches.
     - If the higher-rated cow is at an index greater than `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - **Two higher ratings** (`len(ind) == 2`):
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, cow `k` can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` matches.
     - If `k` is greater than the index of the second higher-rated cow, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

4. **Debugging Print Statement**:
   - The function includes a print statement for debugging purposes when `k == 14`. This is not part of the required output and can be ignored for correctness.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **No higher ratings**:
  - If no cow has a higher rating than `x`, cow `k` can indeed win all `n - 1` matches. This is correct.

- **One higher rating**:
  - If the higher-rated cow is at index 0, cow `k` can win `k - 1` matches. This is correct because the first match will be lost, and cow `k` will not proceed further.
  - If the higher-rated cow is at an index greater than `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches. This is correct because cow `k` will win all matches until it faces the higher-rated cow.
  - If the higher-rated cow is at an index less than `k`, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. This is correct because the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to either before or after the higher-rated cow to maximize wins.

- **Two higher ratings**:
  - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, cow `k` can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` matches. This is correct because cow `k` will lose the first match, and the optimal strategy is to swap it to a position where it can win the maximum number of subsequent matches.
  - If `k` is greater than the index of the second higher-rated cow, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. This is correct because the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to a position where it can win the maximum number of matches before facing the second higher-rated cow.
  - If `k` is between the two higher-rated cows, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`. This is correct because the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to a position where it can win the maximum number of matches before facing the first higher-rated cow.

### Conclusion:
The logic of the function `func_1` correctly handles all the cases described in the problem. The function's behavior aligns with the expected output for the given examples and the problem constraints.
