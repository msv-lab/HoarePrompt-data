The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The list `a` contains `n` unique integers, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each integer `a_i` is within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- **Case_1:** If none of the other conditions are met, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** If `k` is 14, the function returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3:** If the first element of the list `ind` (which contains indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`) is greater than `k`, the function returns a value that is one less than the first element of `ind`.
- **Case_4:** If the first element of `ind` is less than or equal to `k` but not 0, the function returns the maximum of two values: (14 - the first element of `ind`) and (the first element of `ind` - 1).
- **Case_5:** If the first element of `ind` is 0, the function returns the minimum value between the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1, and `k - 1`.
- **Case_6:** If `ind` contains more than one element, the first element of `ind` is not 0, and `k` is greater than the second element in `ind`, the function returns the maximum value between the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1, and the difference between the indices of the first and second elements in `ind`.
- **Case_7:** If `k` is less than or equal to the second element in `ind`, the function returns the maximum value between the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1, and the difference between `k` and the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of unique integers and returns a value based on the following cases:**
- **Case_1:** Returns `n - 1` if none of the other conditions are met.
- **Case_2:** Returns `13` if `k` is 14.
- **Case_3:** Returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1, if this index is greater than `k`.
- **Case_4:** Returns the larger of (14 - the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`) and (the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1), if this index is less than or equal to `k` but not 0.
- **Case_5:** Returns the smaller of (the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1) and `13`, if the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` is 0.
- **Case_6:** Returns the larger of (the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1) and (the difference between the indices of the first and second elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`), if `ind` contains more than one element, the first element of `ind` is not 0, and `k` is greater than the second element in `ind`.
- **Case_7:** Returns the larger of (the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]` minus 1) and (the difference between `k` and the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`), if `k` is less than or equal to the second element in `ind`.
