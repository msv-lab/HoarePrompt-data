### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **`if n == m:`** This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If so, Nikita can simply add `m` cubes one by one, so the answer is "Yes".
   - **`elif m > n:`** This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. If so, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "No".
   - **`elif m == n - 1:`** This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is exactly one less than the number of moves `n`. If so, Nikita can add `m` cubes and then remove one cube, so the answer is "Yes".
   - **`elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If so, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs, so the answer is "Yes".
   - **`elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. If so, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs, and then adding one more cube, so the answer is "Yes".
   - **`else:`** If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is "No".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios for `n` and `m` within the given constraints (1 <= n, m <= 100).
   - The function correctly handles the cases where `m` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than `n`, `m` is one less than `n`, and the parity of `m` and `n` (both even or both odd).

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Nikita can build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions are comprehensive and cover all possible scenarios within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
