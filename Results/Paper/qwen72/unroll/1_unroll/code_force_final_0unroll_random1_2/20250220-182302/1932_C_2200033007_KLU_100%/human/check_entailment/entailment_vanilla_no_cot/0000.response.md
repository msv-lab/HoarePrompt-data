Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in the way it processes the commands and calculates the product modulo `m`.

1. **Incorrect Processing of Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element.
   - However, the function `func_1` is appending the elements to be removed to the list `b` and then calculating the product in reverse order. This does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - You should calculate the product of all elements in the array `a` at each step before removing an element.
   - After calculating the product, you should then remove the element based on the command ('L' or 'R') and update the product accordingly.

### Corrected Program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = product * a[i] % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = product * pow(a[i], m-2, m) % m
        else:
            product = product * pow(a[n-1-i], m-2, m) % m
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:**
  - `product` is initialized to 1.
  - The first loop calculates the product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.

- **Processing Commands:**
  - For each command, the current product is appended to the list `b`.
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed by dividing the product by the leftmost element and taking the result modulo `m`. This is done using the modular inverse of the element.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed similarly.

- **Modular Inverse:**
  - The modular inverse of `a[i]` modulo `m` is calculated using `pow(a[i], m-2, m)`. This works because `m` is a positive integer and the elements are within the range `[1, 10^4]`, so `m` is likely to be a prime number or a number where the modular inverse exists.

This corrected program should now correctly process the commands and output the required remainders.
