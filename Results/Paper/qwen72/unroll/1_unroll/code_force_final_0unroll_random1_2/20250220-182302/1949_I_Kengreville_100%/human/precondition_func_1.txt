i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, and n is a positive integer indicating the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers where len(x) == len(y) == len(r) == n, and for all 0 <= k < n, -10^9 <= x[k], y[k] <= 10^9, and 1 <= r[k] <= 10^9. visited, tot, and coef are lists where len(visited) == len(coef) == n, and visited contains boolean values, tot is an integer, and coef contains integers. bipartite is a boolean variable.
