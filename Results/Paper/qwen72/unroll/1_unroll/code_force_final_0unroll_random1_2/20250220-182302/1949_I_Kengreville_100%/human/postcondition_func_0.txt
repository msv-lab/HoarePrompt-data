The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. It then performs a series of depth-first search (DFS) operations on a graph represented by these inputs. After processing, the function prints 'YES' if at least one DFS call found the graph to be bipartite and visited at least one node, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists: `visited[i]` is set to `True` for each node `i` visited during the DFS, and `coef[i]` is set to `1` for each visited node. The final state of the program includes `x`, `y`, and `r` lists unchanged, `visited` and `coef` lists updated based on the DFS results, and the variables `tot` and `bipartite` reflecting the last DFS call.
