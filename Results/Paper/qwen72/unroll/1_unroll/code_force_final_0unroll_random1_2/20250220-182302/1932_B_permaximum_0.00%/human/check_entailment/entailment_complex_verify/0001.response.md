### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - Each sign must occur strictly after the previous sign, and the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`.
   - The output should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, we need to calculate the year in which each sign occurs.
   - We start from year 0 and for each sign, we find the next multiple of `a_i` that is greater than the current year.
   - The formula to find the next multiple of `a_i` after the current year `year` is:
     - `next_year = year + (a_i - (year % a_i)) if year % a_i != 0 else year + a_i`
   - The given program uses a different approach:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`
   - This approach works because:
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai` to `year` to get the next multiple.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we add the remainder to `year` to get the next multiple.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - Finally, it prints the year for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
       - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since `4 % 4 = 0`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since `8 % 5 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since `10 % 9 = 1`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since `18 % 18 = 0`).
     - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`.
       - Second sign: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `2 % 3 = 2`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 4 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `4 % 5 = 4`).
     - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - Each sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `year = 1 + 1 = 2`, `year = 2 + 1 = 3`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5`.
     - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`.
       - Second sign: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since `50 % 30 = 20`).
       - Third sign: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since `60 % 711 = 60`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 711 + 129 = 840` (since `711 % 200 = 111`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 840 + 163 = 1003` (since `840 % 503 = 337`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 1003 + 1009 = 2012` (since `1003 % 1006 = 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially. The logic and the formula used are correct and produce the expected results for the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
