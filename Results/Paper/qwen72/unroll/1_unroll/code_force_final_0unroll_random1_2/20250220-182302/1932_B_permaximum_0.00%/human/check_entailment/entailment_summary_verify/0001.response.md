### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - Each sign must occur sequentially, and the year for the i-th sign is the smallest year greater than the previous sign's year that is a multiple of `a_i`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`.
   - The output should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The correct approach to find the year for the i-th sign is to start from the year of the (i-1)-th sign and find the next multiple of `a_i` that is greater than the current year.
   - The formula to find the next multiple of `a_i` after the current year `year` is:
     - `next_year = year + (a_i - (year % a_i)) if year % a_i != 0 else year + a_i`
   - However, the given program uses a different approach:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - Finally, it prints the year for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
       - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since `4 % 4 = 0`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since `8 % 5 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since `10 % 9 = 1`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since `18 % 18 = 0`).
     - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`.
       - Second sign: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1 % 2 = 1`).
       - Third sign: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `2 % 3 = 2`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 4 = 3`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `4 % 5 = 4`).
     - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - Each sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `year = 1 + 1 = 2`, `year = 2 + 1 = 3`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5`.
     - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - First sign: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`.
       - Second sign: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since `50 % 30 = 20`).
       - Third sign: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since `60 % 711 = 60`).
       - Fourth sign: `year = 711 + 129 = 840` (since `711 % 200 = 111`).
       - Fifth sign: `year = 840 + 163 = 1003` (since `840 % 503 = 337`).
       - Sixth sign: `year = 1003 + 1009 = 2012` (since `1003 % 1006 = 1`).

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `year` to 0 and updates it using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - The function prints the final year for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially. The logic and the formula used are correct and produce the expected results for the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
