Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the year for each sign. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` is incorrect. This line is supposed to find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year, but it does not correctly handle the case where the current year is already a multiple of `ai`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 6
```
According to the problem description, the signs should occur in the following years:
- The first sign (2 years) occurs in the 2nd year.
- The second sign (3 years) should occur strictly after the 2nd year, which is in the 3rd year.
- The third sign (6 years) should occur strictly after the 3rd year, which is in the 6th year.

However, the program will output:
```
6
```
This is incorrect because the second sign should occur in the 3rd year, not the 6th year.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the next occurrence of each sign after the current year. The correct approach would be to use the formula `year += (ai - year % ai) if year % ai != 0 else ai` to ensure that the next occurrence is strictly after the current year.
