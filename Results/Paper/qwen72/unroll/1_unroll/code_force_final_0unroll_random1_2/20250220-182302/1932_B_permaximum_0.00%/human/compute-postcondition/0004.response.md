Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing periodicities. The function calculates the sum of the smallest non-zero remainder of `year` when divided by each periodicity in the list, or the periodicity itself if the remainder is zero. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and the list of periodicities are consumed and not retained. **
