You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [num - 1 for num in a]

            t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
            if t1 not in st and t2 in st:

        even.sort()
        for gap in odd:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        for gap in even:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap

        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional vertices `y` from the input. It also reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie. The function calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid moves Bessie can make, considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices `y`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not preserve the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of chosen vertices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly account for the possibility of forming additional triangles when choosing vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The polygon has 5 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices (1 and 3), and you can choose up to 2 more vertices.
- **Expected Output:** By choosing vertices 2 and 4, you can form 3 non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5).
- **Actual Output:** The program only forms 2 triangles, which is incorrect.

The program's logic for choosing additional vertices and forming triangles is flawed, leading to suboptimal results in certain cases.
