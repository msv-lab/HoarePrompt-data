You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from input, processes a list of `x` integers representing Bessie's chosen vertices, and prints the value of `ans` which is calculated based on the conditions described in the loop. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not preserved, and the only output is the sequence of `ans` values printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional vertices `y` from the input. It also reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie. The function calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid moves Bessie can make, considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices `y`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not preserve the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of chosen vertices.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bessie has a regular polygon cake with `n` sides.
   - She has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - You can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and adjusts them to be 0-indexed.

3. **Initial Triangles:**
   - The program starts by assuming that the number of triangles is `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals.

4. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices and checks if the next two vertices (clockwise) are already chosen.
   - If the next vertex is not chosen but the one after it is, it increments the triangle count by 1. This is because adding a diagonal from the current vertex to the next chosen vertex forms an additional triangle.

5. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The program then calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - It categorizes these gaps into odd and even gaps.
   - For odd gaps, it tries to add vertices to form additional triangles. Each odd gap can form `gap` triangles, and it uses `gap // 2` vertices.
   - For even gaps, it does the same, but the logic for even gaps is slightly different.

6. **Optimizing the Triangle Count:**
   - The program sorts the gaps and tries to use the smallest gaps first to maximize the number of triangles.
   - It iterates through the odd and even gaps, adding vertices to form triangles and decrementing `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is exhausted before all gaps are considered, it adds the remaining possible triangles using the remaining `y` vertices.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Triangle Count:** The initial count `x - 2` is correct because any `x` vertices can form `x - 2` triangles.
- **Additional Triangles:** The logic for checking if the next two vertices are chosen and forming an additional triangle is correct.
- **Gap Handling:** The program correctly categorizes gaps and tries to maximize the number of triangles by using the smallest gaps first. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the remaining `y` vertices are used efficiently.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the constraints well, including the case where `y` is exhausted before all gaps are considered.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. It follows the problem constraints and handles the input and output as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
