Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly account for the possibility of forming additional triangles when choosing vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The polygon has 5 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices (1 and 3), and you can choose up to 2 more vertices.
- **Expected Output:** By choosing vertices 2 and 4, you can form 3 non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5).
- **Actual Output:** The program only forms 2 triangles, which is incorrect.

The program's logic for choosing additional vertices and forming triangles is flawed, leading to suboptimal results in certain cases.
