### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It also reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Initialization and Basic Calculations:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to `x - 2`. This is a reasonable starting point because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with two other vertices, and the initial count of triangles is based on the vertices Bessie has already chosen.
   - It converts the vertices to a 0-indexed list and sorts them. This is necessary for easier manipulation and gap calculation.

3. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The function calculates gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list. This is done to determine where additional vertices can be added to form more triangles.
   - It categorizes these gaps into `odd` and `even` lists based on whether the gap is odd or even.

4. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The function iterates over the `odd` and `even` gaps, adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each odd gap, it adds the gap to `ans` and reduces `y` by `gap // 2`.
   - For each even gap, it does the same.
   - If `y` is insufficient to cover the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0, breaking out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Initial Count (`x - 2`):** This is a good starting point because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with two others, and the initial count is based on the vertices Bessie has already chosen.
- **Gap Calculation:** The gaps are correctly calculated and categorized into odd and even.
- **Maximizing Triangles:** The logic for adding vertices to maximize triangles is sound. It correctly handles the case where `y` is insufficient to cover the gap by adding `2 * y` to `ans` and breaking out of the loop.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:** The function should handle edge cases where `y` is 0 or very small, and where the gaps are very large.
- **Input Constraints:** The function should ensure that the input constraints are met, but the problem description guarantees valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given constraints and problem description. The function handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for gap calculation and maximizing triangles is sound.
