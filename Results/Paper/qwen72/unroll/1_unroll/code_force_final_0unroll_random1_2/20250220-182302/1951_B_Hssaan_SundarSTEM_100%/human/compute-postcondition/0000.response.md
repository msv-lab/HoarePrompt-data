The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts includes the function parameters, but these do not directly affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
