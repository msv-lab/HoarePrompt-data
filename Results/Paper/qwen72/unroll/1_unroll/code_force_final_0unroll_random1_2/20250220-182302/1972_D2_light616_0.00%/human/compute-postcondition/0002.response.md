The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are the input integers, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
