The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. Right before the loop, `x` is 1 and `cnt` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be such that `1 * 1 <= n`, which simplifies to `1 <= n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
