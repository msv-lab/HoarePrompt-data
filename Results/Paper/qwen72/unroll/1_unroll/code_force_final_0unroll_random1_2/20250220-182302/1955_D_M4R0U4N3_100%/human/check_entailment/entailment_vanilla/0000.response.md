### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a global `cnt_b` list to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`. This list is initialized to have a length of `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is 1,000,000) to cover the range of possible values in `b`.
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Count for Array `b`**:
   - The program increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` list. This helps in quickly checking how many elements in a subarray of `a` match the elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - The program initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements in the current subarray of `a` that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - It then checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (i.e., `a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (i.e., `a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after each slide, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts**:
   - After processing each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
- The use of `cnt_b` and `b_values` ensures that the program can quickly determine the number of matching elements in each subarray.
- The logic for updating `curr` and `ans` is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as resetting the counts for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
