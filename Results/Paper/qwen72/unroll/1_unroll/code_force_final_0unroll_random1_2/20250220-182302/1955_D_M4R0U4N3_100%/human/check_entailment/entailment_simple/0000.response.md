### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and `cnt_b` to a list of zeros with length `max_val + 1`. This is used to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to reflect the frequency of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will store the number of matching elements in the current subsegment of `a`.
   - It checks the first subsegment of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subsegment, if the element is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decreases the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function then uses a sliding window approach to check all subsegments of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each new element added to the window (i.e., `a[i + m]`), if it is in `b_values`, it decreases the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
     - For each element removed from the window (i.e., `a[i]`), if it is in `b_values`, it increases the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after the update, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting `cnt_b`:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes and updates the `cnt_b` list to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
- The sliding window approach is used to efficiently check each subsegment of length `m` in `a` without recalculating the entire subsegment from scratch.
- The conditions for updating `curr` and checking if the subsegment is good are correctly implemented.
- The function correctly handles the reset of `cnt_b` after each test case to ensure that the counts are not carried over to the next test case.
