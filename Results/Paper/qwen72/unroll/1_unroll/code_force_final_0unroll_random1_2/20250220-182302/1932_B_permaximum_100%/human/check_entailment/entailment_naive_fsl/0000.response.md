Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur in a way that the next sign's year is not strictly after the previous sign's year. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next year is flawed.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 6
```
The expected output is 6, because:
- The first sign occurs in year 2.
- The second sign occurs in year 3 (strictly after year 2).
- The third sign occurs in year 6 (strictly after year 3).

However, the program will output 12, because it incorrectly calculates the next year for the third sign. The issue lies in the line:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```
This line ensures that the next year is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, but it does not ensure that the next year is strictly after `current_year`. Instead, it should calculate the next year as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `current_year`.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year + ai - 1) // ai * ai
            current_year = next_year + ai
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```
This ensures that the next year is strictly after the current year.
