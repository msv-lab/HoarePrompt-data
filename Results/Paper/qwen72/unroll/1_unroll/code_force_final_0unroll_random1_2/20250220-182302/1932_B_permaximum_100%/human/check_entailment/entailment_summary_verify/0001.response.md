### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - The logic to determine the next year in which the sign will occur is:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - This logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially, starting from the year after the previous sign.
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Sequential Occurrence**:
  - The function correctly ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
  - The calculation of `next_year` is accurate:
    - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
    - Otherwise, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.

- **Example Verification**:
  - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
    - The first sign occurs in year 3.
    - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 is not a multiple of 2, the next multiple is 4).
    - The third sign occurs in year 8 (since 4 is not a multiple of 4, the next multiple is 8).
    - The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since 8 is not a multiple of 5, the next multiple is 10).
    - The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since 10 is not a multiple of 9, the next multiple is 18).
    - The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since 18 is not a multiple of 18, the next multiple is 36).
  - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
    - The first sign occurs in year 1.
    - The second sign occurs in year 2.
    - The third sign occurs in year 3.
    - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
    - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
  - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
    - The first sign occurs in year 1.
    - The second sign occurs in year 2.
    - The third sign occurs in year 3.
    - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
    - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
  - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
    - The first sign occurs in year 50.
    - The second sign occurs in year 60 (since 50 is not a multiple of 30, the next multiple is 60).
    - The third sign occurs in year 711 (since 60 is not a multiple of 711, the next multiple is 711).
    - The fourth sign occurs in year 800 (since 711 is not a multiple of 200, the next multiple is 800).
    - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006 (since 800 is not a multiple of 503, the next multiple is 1006).
    - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (since 1006 is not a multiple of 1006, the next multiple is 2012).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. It handles all the test cases as expected.

Final: **True**
