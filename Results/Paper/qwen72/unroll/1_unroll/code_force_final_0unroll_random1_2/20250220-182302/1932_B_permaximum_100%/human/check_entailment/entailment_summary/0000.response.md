Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The function iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the list of sign periodicities (`a`). For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the current year (`current_year`). This is done by finding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition `if current_year % ai == 0:` is incorrect because it should not update `current_year` to `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`. Instead, it should just set `next_year` to `current_year` if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`. The correct approach is to always set `next_year` to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year + 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year + ai - 1) // ai * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Given the original function, the output is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai` correctly. The function should always move to the next year after the current year, not stay in the same year or move to the next multiple of `ai` from the current year.

Correctness: **False**
