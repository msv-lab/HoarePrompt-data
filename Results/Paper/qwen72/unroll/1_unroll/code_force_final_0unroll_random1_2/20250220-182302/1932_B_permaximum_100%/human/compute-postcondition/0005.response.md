Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that, for each test case, is the next year in which all signs in the list `a` will align (i.e., the next year where the year is a multiple of all integers in `a`). **
