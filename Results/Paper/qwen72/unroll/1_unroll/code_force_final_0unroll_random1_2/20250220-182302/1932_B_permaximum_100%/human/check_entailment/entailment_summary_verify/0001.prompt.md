You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest positive integer that, for each test case, is the next year in which all signs in the list `a` will align (i.e., the next year where the year is a multiple of all integers in `a`).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to `next_year` after each iteration.
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` ensures that the signs occur sequentially as described in the problem.
- The calculation of `next_year` correctly finds the next year in which the sign will occur, starting from the year after the previous sign.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by storing and processing each one separately.

### Example Verification:

- For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 is not a multiple of 2, the next multiple is 4).
  - The third sign occurs in year 8 (since 4 is not a multiple of 4, the next multiple is 8).
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since 8 is not a multiple of 5, the next multiple is 10).
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since 10 is not a multiple of 9, the next multiple is 18).
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since 18 is not a multiple of 18, the next multiple is 36).

- For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.

- For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.

- For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 50.
  - The second sign occurs in year 60 (since 50 is not a multiple of 30, the next multiple is 60).
  - The third sign occurs in year 711 (since 60 is not a multiple of 711, the next multiple is 711).
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 800 (since 711 is not a multiple of 200, the next multiple is 800).
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006 (since 800 is not a multiple of 503, the next multiple is 1006).
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (since 1006 is not a multiple of 1006, the next multiple is 2012).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. It handles all the test cases as expected.
