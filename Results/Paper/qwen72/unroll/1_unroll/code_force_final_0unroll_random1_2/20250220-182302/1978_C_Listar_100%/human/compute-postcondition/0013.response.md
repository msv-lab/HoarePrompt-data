The function `func_4` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the output cases, it seems there are implicit parameters `n` and `k` that are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns different values based on these implicit parameters:

- Case_1: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_2: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_3: The function returns (`n`, `k`), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` and is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function returns (0, 0) in Case_1 and Case_2. In Case_3, it returns (`n`, `k`), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive), with `max_k` set to `n` and `max_k` >= `k`.**
