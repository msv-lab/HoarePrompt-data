### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, `func_4()` is called to validate the input and determine if a permutation is possible.
   - `func_4()` checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - If `func_4()` returns valid `n` and `k`, `func_1()` is called to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - `func_1()` initializes a list `l` with a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates over the list, swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value by 2 in each step until the required `k` is achieved or it is determined that the required `k` cannot be achieved.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - `func_3()` swaps elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` to increase the Manhattan value.
   - `func_2()` is used when the remaining `k` is less than the current step size, performing a final swap to achieve the exact `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid permutation is found, `func_5()` is called to print "YES" followed by the permutation.
   - If no valid permutation is found, "NO" is printed.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **func_4()**:
  - The function correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
  - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated correctly:
    - For odd `n`, the maximum value is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\).
    - For even `n`, the maximum value is \(n^2 // 2\).

- **func_1()**:
  - The function initializes the permutation list `l` correctly.
  - It iterates over the list, reducing `k` by 2 in each step and swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value.
  - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is reduced to 0, returning the permutation.
  - If `k` is less than the current step size, it calls `func_2()` to perform the final swap.

- **func_2()**:
  - The function performs a final swap to achieve the exact `k` when `k` is less than the current step size.
  - It correctly updates the list `l` and returns it.

- **func_3()**:
  - The function swaps elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` to increase the Manhattan value by 2.
  - It correctly updates the list `l` and returns it.

- **func_5()**:
  - The function prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
  - It correctly handles the output format as required.

- **func_6()**:
  - The function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4()` to validate the input, `func_1()` to generate the permutation, and `func_5()` to print the result.
  - It correctly handles the case where no valid permutation is found by printing "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input validation, permutation generation, and output formatting based on the problem description. The logic for generating the permutation and ensuring the Manhattan value is correct is sound.
