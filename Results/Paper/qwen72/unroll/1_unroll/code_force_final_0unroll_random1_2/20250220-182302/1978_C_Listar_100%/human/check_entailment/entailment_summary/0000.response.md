Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation (`func_4`)**:
   - `func_4` reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. For an odd `n`, `max_k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for an even `n`, `max_k` is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - If `k` is valid, it returns the original `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` initializes a list `l` with the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over the list, swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function uses a counter `c` to keep track of the number of swaps.
   - If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, it returns the current permutation `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, it calls `func_2` to perform a specific swap and returns the result.
   - Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` using `func_3` and decrements `k` until the loop completes.

3. **Specific Swaps (`func_2` and `func_3`)**:
   - `func_2` swaps elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.
   - `func_3` swaps elements at indices `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - Both functions ensure that the elements being swapped are within the valid range of the list.

4. **Output Handling (`func_5`)**:
   - `func_5` prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It ensures that the output format matches the problem requirements.

5. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - `func_6` calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Validation**: `func_4` correctly validates the input and ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
- **Permutation Construction**: `func_1` constructs the permutation by iteratively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic of swapping elements and decrementing `k` is consistent with the problem's requirements.
- **Output**: `func_5` prints the permutation in the correct format.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `k` being odd or exceeding the maximum possible value.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input validation, permutation construction, and output formatting as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
