The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`, where `c` and `k` are non-negative integers, and `l` is a list of integers. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, which remains the same length and contains the same integers, but the values at the specified indices have been swapped.
