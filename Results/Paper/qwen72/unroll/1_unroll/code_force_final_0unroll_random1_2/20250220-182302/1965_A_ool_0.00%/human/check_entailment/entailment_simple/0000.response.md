### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the winner of the game.
   - The initial condition checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1. If it is not 1, the function returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the game's outcome does not solely depend on the first element of the array.
   - The program then creates a sorted set of unique values from `arr` and iterates through this set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it is, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks the loop.
   - The variable `A` is toggled in each iteration of the loop, which is intended to simulate the turns of the players. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner is the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.
   - The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement this strategy. It relies on the first element of the array and the differences between consecutive elements, which are not relevant to the game's outcome.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct approach would be to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determine the winner based on the parity of this count.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the optimal play strategy for the game. The logic for determining the winner is flawed and does not align with the rules of the game.

### Correctness:
**False**
