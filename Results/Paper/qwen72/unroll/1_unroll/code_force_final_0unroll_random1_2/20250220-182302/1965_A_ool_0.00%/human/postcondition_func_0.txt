The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It returns 'Alice' if the first element of `arr` is not 1 or if the difference between any two consecutive unique elements in the sorted list of `arr` is exactly 1 and the number of such differences is odd. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.
