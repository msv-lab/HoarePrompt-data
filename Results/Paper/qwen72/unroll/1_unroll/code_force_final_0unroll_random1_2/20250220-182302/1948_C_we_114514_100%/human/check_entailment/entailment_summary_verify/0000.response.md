Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the robot can move vertically between the two rows. The function only checks specific conditions for horizontal movements and does not account for the possibility of the robot moving down and then right again, or up and then right again. This is a critical oversight in the logic of the function, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
4
><><
><><
```

The robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
1. (1, 1) to (2, 1) (robot moves down, then follows the arrow to the right)
2. (2, 1) to (2, 2) (robot moves right, then follows the arrow to the right)
3. (2, 2) to (1, 2) (robot moves up, then follows the arrow to the right)
4. (1, 2) to (1, 3) (robot moves right, then follows the arrow to the right)
5. (1, 3) to (2, 3) (robot moves down, then follows the arrow to the right)
6. (2, 3) to (2, 4) (robot moves right, then follows the arrow to the right)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` would return 'No' for this case because it only checks the conditions for moving right and does not consider the vertical movements between rows.

The function `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can move to the right in the first row and then potentially move down to the second row, but it does not account for the robot being able to move up from the second row back to the first row and continue moving right. This limitation means that the function can miss valid paths that the robot can take to reach the target cell (2, n).

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is not correct for the given problem description.

Final: **False**
