Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` from standard input. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments and appends the result of each call to a list `results`. Finally, it prints each element of `results` on a new line. The function does not return any value. **
