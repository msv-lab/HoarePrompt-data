Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The function `func_1` processes each test case by:

1. **Counting the Frequency of Each Difficulty Level**: It initializes a list `freq` of size 7 (to represent the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') with zeros. It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each character based on its difficulty level (using `ord(prob) - ord('A')` to map 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, etc.).

2. **Calculating the Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of problems needed to reach `m` by using `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the frequency of the current difficulty level. It sums these values to get the total number of missing problems.

3. **Appending the Result**: The total number of missing problems for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

4. **Returning the Results**: After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the inputs and outputs as specified. The logic for counting the frequency of each difficulty level and calculating the missing problems is sound and efficient. The function also correctly processes multiple test cases and returns the expected results.

Given the example inputs and outputs provided, the function produces the correct results for each test case:

- For the test case `(10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED')`, the function correctly outputs `2` because 'A' and 'F' are missing.
- For the test case `(10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED')`, the function correctly outputs `5` because 'A', 'F', and 'G' are missing, and each of 'B', 'C', and 'D' are missing one more problem to reach 2.
- For the test case `(9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG')`, the function correctly outputs `1` because 'A' is missing.

Since the program meets all the requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples, it can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
