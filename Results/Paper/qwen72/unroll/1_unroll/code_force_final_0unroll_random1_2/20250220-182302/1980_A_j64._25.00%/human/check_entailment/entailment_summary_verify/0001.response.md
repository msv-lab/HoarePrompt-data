Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly defines the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the results. This part of the code is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case. This is correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function iterates over each test case using a for loop. For each test case, it unpacks the tuple `(n, m, a)` into the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. This is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Frequency Calculation**: It initializes a list `freq` of length 7 (to represent the frequencies of problems from 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using `ord(prob) - ord('A')` to map 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on. This is correct and effectively counts the frequency of each difficulty level.

5. **Calculate Missing Problems**: It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This expression ensures that if there are enough problems of a certain difficulty, the result is 0; otherwise, it calculates the difference between the required number of problems `m` and the available number of problems `f`. This is correct and follows the problem description.

6. **Sum of Missing Problems**: It sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels and appends the result to the `results` list. This is correct and ensures that the total number of additional problems needed is calculated.

7. **Return Results**: Finally, the function returns the `results` list. This is correct and follows the problem description.

8. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the problem description and the steps taken in the program, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
