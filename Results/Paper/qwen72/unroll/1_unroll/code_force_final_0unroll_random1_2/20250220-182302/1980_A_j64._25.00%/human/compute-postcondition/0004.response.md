Output State: **The program returns the `results` list, which contains `t` integers. Each integer in the `results` list represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`. The `freq` list and `missing` are recalculated for each test case, but they are not part of the returned output.**
