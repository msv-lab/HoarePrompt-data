### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and corresponding times of the known points.
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra 0 at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0).

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program calculates the differences between consecutive positions and times, storing them in `ad` and `bd` respectively.
   - `ad` contains the distances between consecutive known points.
   - `bd` contains the time differences between consecutive known points.

3. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - The program calculates the speed between each pair of consecutive known points and stores these speeds in the list `v`.
   - Speed `v[i]` is calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where the query point `ql` would fit in the list `a`.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - If the query point `ql` is not at a known point, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the position of the previous known point `a[s-1]` from `ql` to get the remaining distance.
     - Adding the time to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the speed `v[s]`.
   - The time is then rounded down to the nearest integer using `int(m)`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the starting point (0, 0) by initializing `a` and `b` with an extra 0 at the beginning.
   - The program also handles the case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points by directly printing the corresponding time.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the correct segment for each query, making it suitable for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the edge cases and the requirement to round down the time to the nearest integer. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
