Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the test cases, and calculates the time it takes for the car to reach each query point, rounding down to the nearest integer. The use of the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module efficiently finds the appropriate segment for each query, and the program correctly computes the time based on the speed of the car in that segment. The program also handles the edge case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points. The logic and implementation align with the requirements of the problem statement.
