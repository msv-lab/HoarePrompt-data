The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute at least once as long as `t` is within this range. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop to iterate a certain number of times without using the loop index, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration**
