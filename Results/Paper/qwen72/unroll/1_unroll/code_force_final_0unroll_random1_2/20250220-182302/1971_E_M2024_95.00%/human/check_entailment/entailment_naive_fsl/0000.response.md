Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the query point `d` is exactly at one of the known points `a_i`. Specifically, the line `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` should be adjusted to ensure that if `ql` is exactly at a known point, it is correctly identified and the corresponding time `b[s]` is returned. However, the current implementation incorrectly subtracts `a[s - 1]` and adds `b[s - 1]` even when `ql` is exactly at a known point, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
10 2 2
4 10
4 7
4
10
```
The expected output is:
```
4 7
```
However, the program will output:
```
4 6
```
This is because when `ql` is 10, the program incorrectly calculates the time by subtracting `a[s - 1]` and adding `b[s - 1]`, instead of directly returning `b[s]` when `a[s] == ql`.
