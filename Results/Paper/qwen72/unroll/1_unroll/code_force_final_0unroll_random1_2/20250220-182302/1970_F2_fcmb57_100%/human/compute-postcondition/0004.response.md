Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is a single integer, the function raises a `ValueError` due to the unpacking issue and does not return any values. **
