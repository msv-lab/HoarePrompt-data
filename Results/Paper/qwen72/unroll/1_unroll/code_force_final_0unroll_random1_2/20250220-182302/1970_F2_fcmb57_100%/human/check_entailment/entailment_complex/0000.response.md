Reasoning:  
The program provided has a logical issue with the function `func_1`. The function is intended to take a position (a tuple of two integers) and a direction (a tuple representing the movement in the x and y directions) and return the new position after applying the movement. However, the function incorrectly attempts to unpack `b` (which is a tuple of movement directions) as a single integer, leading to a `ValueError`. This error would prevent the program from running correctly, as the function is used to update the positions of entities on the field.

Additionally, the program has a logical error in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who caught the Quaffle.

These issues would prevent the program from functioning as intended and correctly simulating the game of Quidditch according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
