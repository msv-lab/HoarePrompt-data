#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program raises a `ValueError` because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. No values are returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is a single integer, the function raises a `ValueError` due to the unpacking issue and does not return any values.
