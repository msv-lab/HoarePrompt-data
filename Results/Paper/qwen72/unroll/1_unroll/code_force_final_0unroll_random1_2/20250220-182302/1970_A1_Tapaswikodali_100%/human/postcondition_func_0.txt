The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with `balance` and `position` attributes. If the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are not equal, the function returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and the `balance` of `infoB`. If the `balance` attributes are equal, the function returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and the `position` of `infoA`. The function does not modify the `infoA` or `infoB` objects.
