Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input. The function then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions `(x - n * i) % i == 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for each divisor `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
