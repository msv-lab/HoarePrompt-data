### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems such that their sum is equal to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be the balance of the problemset.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `n`.
   - For each test case, the output should be the maximum possible GCD of the difficulties of the `n` sub-problems.

3. **Approach**:
   - The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - If `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`, it updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - It also checks the same condition for the complementary divisor `x // i`.

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - **Iterating Divisors**: It iterates through all divisors of `x` from 1 to `sqrt(x)`.
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` to ensure that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for the complementary divisor `x // i`.
   - **Updating Maximum GCD**: If either condition is satisfied, it updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - **Printing Result**: After processing all divisors, it prints the maximum GCD for the current test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n == x` by checking if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems of difficulty 1.
   - It also handles the case where `n == 1` by returning `x` itself as the GCD.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently reduces the number of checks by only iterating up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for divisor-related problems.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems by iterating through all possible divisors and checking the conditions.
- The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and that each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of the GCD.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
