Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the values of `n` and `k`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the list `L` and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset to their initial states (empty list, 0, and 1 respectively) for each iteration.**
