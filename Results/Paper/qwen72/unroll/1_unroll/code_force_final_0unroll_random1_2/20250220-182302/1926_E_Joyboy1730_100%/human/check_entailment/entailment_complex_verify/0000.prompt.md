You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

    34 14
    
    84 19

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the values of `n` and `k`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the list `L` and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset to their initial states (empty list, 0, and 1 respectively) for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function calculates a specific value based on `n` and `k` and prints it. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) from the input and processes each test case in a loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated values for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all input values have been processed, and the results have been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where \( n \) is large and \( k \) is the last card to be laid down. Specifically, the program appends the number of cards to be laid down in each step to the list \( L \), but it does not correctly track the position of the \( k \)-th card. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```

The expected output is 536870912, as specified in the problem description. However, the program will not correctly compute this because it does not handle the large values of \( n \) and \( k \) efficiently. The logic for determining the \( k \)-th card is flawed, as it does not correctly account for the cumulative count of cards laid down in each step. This can lead to incorrect results for large inputs.
