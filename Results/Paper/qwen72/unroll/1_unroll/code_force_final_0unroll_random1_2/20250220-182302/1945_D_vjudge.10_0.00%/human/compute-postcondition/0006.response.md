The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person to move to the front.
  - `b`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i when Kirill moves from position i to j.

The function returns the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case. If it is impossible for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m`, the function returns an appropriate error message or a special value indicating the impossibility.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts the number of people in the queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill `m`, a list of costs to bribe each person to move to the front `a`, and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions when Kirill moves `b`. It returns the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case, or an appropriate error message if it is impossible.**
