You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

        print(c)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting the input strings to integers.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes the cost `custo` to 0 for each test case.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the position `max_p` (exclusive) in reverse order. This is done to calculate the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if the cost to move to position `y` is less when paying `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`. It adds the minimum of these two values to `custo`.

3. **Final Position Adjustment**:
   - After the initial loop, the program iterates from `max_p - 1` to 1 in reverse order. This is to adjust the final position of Kirill to ensure he is among the first `m` people.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks if the cost to move to position `y - 1` plus the cost to move to position `y` is less than or equal to the cost to move to position `y`. If so, it adds the cost to move to position `y` to `custo`.
   - If the position `y` is 1, it adds the cost to move to position 0 (`a_values[0]`) to `custo` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met, it adds the cost to move to position `y` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated cost `custo` to the list `custos`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `max_p` is 1 correctly by ensuring Kirill moves to the first position if necessary.
   - The program also handles the case where `max_p` is equal to `num_fila` correctly by ensuring Kirill does not need to move if he is already in the last position.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that the cost to move to position `y` is either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`. This is not correct because the cost to move to position `y` depends on the positions and costs of all people between `y` and the current position.
  - The program should use a more dynamic approach to calculate the minimum cost, considering all possible positions and their associated costs.

- **Logic for Final Position Adjustment**:
  - The logic for adjusting the final position is flawed. It does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of moving through multiple positions.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
