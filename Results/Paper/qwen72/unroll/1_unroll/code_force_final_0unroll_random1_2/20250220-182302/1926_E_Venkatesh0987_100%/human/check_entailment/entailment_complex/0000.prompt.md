Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0

            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)

            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: The loop executes for each test case, and for each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions provided. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are updated within the loop, but they are reinitialized for each test case. After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as they were initially, and the values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values for the next test case. The output for each test case will be a single integer, either `2 * k - 1` or `2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a single integer result. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function performs a series of calculations and prints a value derived from these calculations. Otherwise, it prints `2 * k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function has no side effects on the input variables `n` and `k`, and all local variables are reset for the next test case.
