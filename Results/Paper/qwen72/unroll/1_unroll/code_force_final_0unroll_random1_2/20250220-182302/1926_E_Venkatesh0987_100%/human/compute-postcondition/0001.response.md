Output State: **The loop executes for each test case, and for each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions provided. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are updated within the loop, but they are reinitialized for each test case. After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as they were initially, and the values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values for the next test case. The output for each test case will be a single integer, either `2 * k - 1` or `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, depending on the condition `k > (n + 1) // 2`.**
