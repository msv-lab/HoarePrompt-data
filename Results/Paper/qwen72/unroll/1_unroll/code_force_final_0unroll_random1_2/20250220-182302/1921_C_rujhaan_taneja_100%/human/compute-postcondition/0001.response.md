The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over the range of `test_cases`, `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9
- `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `test_cases` is an input integer

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
