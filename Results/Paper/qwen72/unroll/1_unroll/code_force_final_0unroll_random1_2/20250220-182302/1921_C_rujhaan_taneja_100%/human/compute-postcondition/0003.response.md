The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m` (where `m` contains `n` elements). The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The list `m` contains integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m`. It returns a result based on the given constraints.**
