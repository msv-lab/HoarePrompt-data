Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without his phone's charge dropping to 0 or below. The key logic involves calculating the charge consumption for each message and checking if the total consumption is less than or equal to the initial charge.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - For the first message, it checks if the phone can be turned on at the moment `m_1` without turning it off. If `m_1` is less than `b / a`, it appends the charge consumption `m_1 * a` to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the time difference between the current message and the previous message is less than `b / a`. If so, it appends the charge consumption `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption**:
   - The program then calculates the total charge consumption for the messages that require the phone to be on continuously.
   - It also accounts for the charge consumption when turning the phone off and on between messages. The total charge consumption for turning the phone off and on is `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
   - Finally, it checks if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the total charge consumption is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues in the program:

- **Incorrect Condition for First Message**:
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` should be `if arr[0] * a < b` to correctly check if the phone can be turned on at the moment `m_1` without turning it off. The current condition `arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect because it should compare the charge consumption directly, not the time.

- **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages**:
  - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` should be `elif (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b` to correctly check if the phone can be turned on at the moment `m_i` without turning it off. The current condition is incorrect for the same reason as above.

- **Output Case Sensitivity**:
  - The program outputs 'Yes' and 'No' in lowercase, but the problem description states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). While this is not a correctness issue, it is worth noting for consistency.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not correctly handle the charge consumption conditions.

Correctness: **False**
