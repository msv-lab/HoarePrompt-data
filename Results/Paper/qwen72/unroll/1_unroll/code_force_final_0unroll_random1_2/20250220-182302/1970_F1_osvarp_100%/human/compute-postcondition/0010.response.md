The `allPlayers` dictionary is updated to reflect the final state (True or False) of each player after the loop executes. The `goal` list remains unchanged, containing the coordinates of the 'BG' and 'WG' elements. The `points` list is updated to reflect the final score of each team after the loop executes.**
