You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

    #State: The `grid` remains a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements read from the input. The `elements` dictionary is updated to reflect the final positions of all players and the Quaffle ('.B') after the loop executes. The `allPlayers` dictionary is updated to reflect the final state (True or False) of each player after the loop executes. The `goal` list remains unchanged, containing the coordinates of the 'BG' and 'WG' elements. The `points` list is updated to reflect the final score of each team after the loop executes.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the final score of the Blue team and points[1] is the final score of the White team)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns a value based on internal parameters `n` and `m`, which are odd integers between 3 and 99.
