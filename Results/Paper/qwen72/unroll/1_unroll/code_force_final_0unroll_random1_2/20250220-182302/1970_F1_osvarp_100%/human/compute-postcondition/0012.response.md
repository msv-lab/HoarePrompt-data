The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints indicate that `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. Since these parameters are not part of the function signature, they are likely used internally within the function. The function returns a value based on these internal parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on internal parameters `n` and `m`, which are odd integers between 3 and 99.**
