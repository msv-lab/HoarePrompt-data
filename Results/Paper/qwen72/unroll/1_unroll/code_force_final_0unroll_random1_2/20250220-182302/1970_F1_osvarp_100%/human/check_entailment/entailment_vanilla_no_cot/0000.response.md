Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of Elements**: The dictionary `elements` is initialized with `'.B': (-1, -1)`, which is not a valid initialization for the game. The Quaffle is represented by `'.Q'`, not `'.B'`.

2. **Handling of the Quaffle**: The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's movement and catching. For example, the Quaffle should be placed back in the middle of the field when a goal is scored, but this is not implemented correctly.

3. **Player Elimination**: The program includes logic for player elimination, which is not part of the problem description. The problem only mentions moving, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.

4. **Golden Snitch**: The program includes logic for catching the Golden Snitch, which is not part of the problem description. The problem only mentions the Quaffle.

5. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The goal scoring logic is incorrect. The program does not correctly identify when a player scores a goal and does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

6. **Movement and Position Updates**: The program does not correctly update the positions of players and the Quaffle after each action. It also does not check if the Quaffle is being carried by a player before allowing a throw action.

7. **Final Score Output**: The final score output is correct, but it relies on the incorrect scoring logic.

To correct the program, you would need to:
- Remove the player elimination and Golden Snitch logic.
- Correctly initialize the Quaffle's position.
- Implement the logic for moving entities, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.
- Ensure that the Quaffle is placed back in the middle of the field when a goal is scored.
- Correctly handle the scoring logic, including scoring in the wrong goal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    GoalName = ['RED', 'BLUE']
    middle = ((n + 1) // 2, (m + 1) // 2)
    elements['.Q'] = middle

    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        grid.append(line)
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = (i, ind)
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
    
    mov = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}
    
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        command = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        if len(command) == 3:
            (obj, com, el) = command
            if el == '.Q' and isPlayer(obj) and elements[el] == elements[obj]:
                allPlayers[obj] = True
        else:
            (obj, com) = command
            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])
            if isPlayer(obj):
                elements[obj] = nxt
                if allPlayers[obj] and com == 'T':
                    if goalIn(nxt) != -1:
                        team = goalIn(nxt)
                        if obj[0] == GoalName[team][0]:
                            points[1 - team] += 1
                            print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[1 - team]))
                        else:
                            points[team] += 1
                            print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                        elements['.Q'] = middle
                        allPlayers[obj] = False
            elif obj == '.Q':
                elements['.Q'] = nxt
    
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

def goalIn(pos):
    if pos in goal[0]:
        return 0
    elif pos in goal[1]:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1

def isPlayer(el):
    return (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'

func_1()
```

This corrected version should handle the game logic as described in the problem statement.
