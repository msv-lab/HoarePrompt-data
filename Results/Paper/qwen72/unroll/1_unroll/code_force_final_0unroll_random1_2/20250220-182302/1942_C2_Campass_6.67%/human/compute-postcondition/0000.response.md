Output State: **The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the problem as described. The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `R` is a lambda function that maps the input split by spaces to integers.**
