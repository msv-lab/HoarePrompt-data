Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each with a different set of inputs. For each test case, it takes the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of distinct ratings `ratings`. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be considered as having a higher rating than your cow, based on the given ratings and the position of your cow. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the result for each one, and the final state of the program will be the completion of the last test case, with all local variables reset and redefined for each iteration. **
