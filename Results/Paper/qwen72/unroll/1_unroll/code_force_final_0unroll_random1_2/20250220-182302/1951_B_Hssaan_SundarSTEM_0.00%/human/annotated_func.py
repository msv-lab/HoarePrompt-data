#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is the number of cows, `k` is the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `ratings` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ratings[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: The loop will execute multiple times, each time processing a new set of inputs. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by your cow in each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` will be reset and redefined for each iteration, so their final values will be the ones corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each with a different set of inputs. For each test case, it takes the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of distinct ratings `ratings`. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be considered as having a higher rating than your cow, based on the given ratings and the position of your cow. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the result for each one, and the final state of the program will be the completion of the last test case, with all local variables reset and redefined for each iteration.
