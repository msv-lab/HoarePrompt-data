You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the tuple (25, sequence). `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`).
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` in each tuple is a list of 25 elements, with each element being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0. Therefore, `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is (25, sequence). The `sequence` is a list of 25 elements, each being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` in each tuple is a list of 25 elements, with each element being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0. Therefore, `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
