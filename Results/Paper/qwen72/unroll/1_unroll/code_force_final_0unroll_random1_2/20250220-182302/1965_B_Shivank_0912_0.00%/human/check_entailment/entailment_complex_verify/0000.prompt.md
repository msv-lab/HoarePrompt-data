You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2

for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [2 ** i for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
    return results

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]

        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the tuple (25, sequence). `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`).
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` in each tuple is a list of 25 elements, with each element being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0. Therefore, `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` in each tuple is a list of 25 elements, with each element being 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 (i.e., `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`). The input parameters `t` and `cases` remain unchanged after the function call.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the sequence generated by the program is always `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, which is a sequence of powers of 2. This sequence does not necessarily meet the conditions for all values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The sequence generated by the program is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`. This sequence includes the number 8, which means there is a subsequence (the number 8 itself) that sums to 8, violating the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.

Additionally, the sequence does not guarantee that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence with a sum of `v`. For instance, in the same example, the sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to 7, which is a valid value for `v` (since `1 ≤ 7 ≤ 8` and `7 ≠ 8`).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
