Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.
