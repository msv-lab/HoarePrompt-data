You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of `n` integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar`, and updates `mex` accordingly. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` is undefined.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Given `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, we can rearrange this to find `p_i`:
     \[
     p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i
     \]
   - We need to maintain the MEX of the prefix of `p` as we construct it.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible MEX value for the permutation.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly calculates `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - ar[i]`.
   - The update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix of `p` up to `i`.
   - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX of the prefix is correctly maintained as it constructs the permutation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `a_i` values are negative or positive, as the MEX calculation and update are correctly managed.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given condition for the array `a`. The logic and steps are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
