The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of `n` integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar`, and updates `mex` accordingly. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` is undefined.
