### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero by performing a specific operation multiple times.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and decrementing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1.
   - The goal is to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its intended purpose.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation while `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`.

4. **Issues in Function 2**:
   - The operation logic is incorrect. The decrement values should be fixed to 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not scaled by `list[i-1]`.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` should be `list[i] > 0` to ensure the operation can be applied even when `list[i]` is 1.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros correctly. It should check if the array can be reduced to all zeros without leaving any negative values.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the sum by 4).
   - Additionally, the function should ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros without any element becoming negative during the process.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in `func_2`, the program is **incorrect**.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 0 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_make_zero(arr, n)`**:
  - First, it checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it returns `False` because each operation reduces the sum by 4.
  - Then, it iterates through the array and applies the operation while the conditions are met.
  - Finally, it checks if all elements in the array are zero using the `all` function.
- **`solve(t, test_cases)`**:
  - It processes each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result of `can_make_zero`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect and needs to be fixed as shown above.)
