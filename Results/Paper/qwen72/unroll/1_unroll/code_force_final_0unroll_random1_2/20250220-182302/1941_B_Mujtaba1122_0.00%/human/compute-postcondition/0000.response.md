The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list), `i` is 1**
