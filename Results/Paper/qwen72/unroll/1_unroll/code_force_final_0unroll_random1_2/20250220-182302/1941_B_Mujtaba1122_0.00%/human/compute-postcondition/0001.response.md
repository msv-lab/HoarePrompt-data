To determine the output state after executing the given loop, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq \text{len(list)}\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
        list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
        list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

### Analysis:
1. **For Loop**: The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to \(n-2\) (inclusive).
2. **While Loop**: The while loop continues as long as:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

3. **Inside the While Loop**:
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[i - 1] = 0`.
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[i] -= 2 * 0`, which does not change `list[i]`.
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[i + 1] -= 1 * 0`, which does not change `list[i + 1]`.

Since `list[i - 1]` is set to 0 in the first iteration of the while loop, the conditions `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0` will no longer be satisfied, and the while loop will terminate immediately after the first iteration.

### Output State:
- For each index \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n-2\):
  - `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0.
  - `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` will remain unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
- The elements at indices 0 to \(n-3\) (inclusive) in the list will be set to 0.
- The elements at indices \(n-2\) and beyond will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **list[0] to list[n-3] are all 0, and list[n-2] to the end of the list remain unchanged.**
