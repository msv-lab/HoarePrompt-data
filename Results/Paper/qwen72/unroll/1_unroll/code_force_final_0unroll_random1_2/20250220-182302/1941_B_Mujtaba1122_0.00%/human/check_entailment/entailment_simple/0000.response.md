### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves an array `a` of `n` integers. The operation allows reducing elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any `i` in the range `2` to `n-1`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Annotated Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `lst`.
     - It then calls `func_2(lst, n)` to process the array.

   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index `0` to `n-1` are zero.
     - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
     - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (i.e., `2` to `n-1` in 1-based indexing).
     - For each index `i`, it enters a while loop if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.
     - Inside the while loop, it reduces `list[i - 1]` by `1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` by `1 * list[i - 1]`.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if the array can be made all zeros.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - **Reduction Calculation**:
     - The reduction in the while loop is incorrect. The line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i - 1] -= 1`.
     - Similarly, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i + 1] -= 1`.
     - The current implementation reduces elements by their own values, which is not the intended operation.

   - **Loop Termination**:
     - The while loop condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is correct for ensuring that the operation can be applied.
     - However, the incorrect reduction logic will cause the loop to either not terminate or produce incorrect results.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should reduce `list[i - 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i + 1]` by 1 in each iteration of the while loop.

### Correctness:
Given the logical errors in the reduction logic, the program as written is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
