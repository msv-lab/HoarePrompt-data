### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero by performing a specific operation multiple times.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and decrementing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1.
   - The goal is to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its intended purpose.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation while `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`.

4. **Issues in Function 2**:
   - **Incorrect Decrement Values**: The decrement values are scaled by `list[i-1]`, which is incorrect. The operation should decrement `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1.
   - **Condition for Operation**: The condition `list[i] > 1` should be `list[i] > 0` to ensure the operation can be applied even when `list[i]` is 1.
   - **Handling Negative Values**: The function does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros correctly. It should ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros without any element becoming negative.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **State Before `func_2` Call**: The list is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.
   - **State After `func_2` Call**: The function attempts to modify the list to set elements from index 0 to `n-3` to 0, while the elements from index `n-2` to the end of the list remain unchanged. However, due to the incorrect decrement values and conditions, this state is not guaranteed.
   - **Final Check with `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called to check if all elements in the list are zero. If the list is not correctly modified by `func_2`, `func_1` will return `False`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the issues in `func_2`.
   - The incorrect decrement values and conditions in `func_2` lead to the program not functioning as intended.
   - The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues and should be used instead.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (The given program is incorrect and needs to be fixed as shown in the corrected program.)
