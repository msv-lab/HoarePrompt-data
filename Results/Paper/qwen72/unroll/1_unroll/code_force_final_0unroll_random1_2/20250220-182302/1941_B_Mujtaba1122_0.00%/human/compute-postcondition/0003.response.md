Based on the initial state provided:

- The list from index 0 to index `n-3` is filled with 0s.
- The elements from index `n-2` to the end of the list remain unchanged.
- The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement does not depend on the state of the list or the return value of `func_1`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
