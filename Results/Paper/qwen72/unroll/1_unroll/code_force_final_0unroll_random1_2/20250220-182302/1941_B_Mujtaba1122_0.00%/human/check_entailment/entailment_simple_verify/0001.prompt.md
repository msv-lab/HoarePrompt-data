You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))

        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will either return False if any of the first n elements in the list are non-zero, or it will complete all iterations without returning if all of the first n elements are zero. The list and n will remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True.

    #State: list[0] to list[n-3] are all 0, and list[n-2] to the end of the list remain unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES

        #This is printed: NO
    #State: list[0] to list[n-3] are all 0, and list[n-2] to the end of the list remain unchanged. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the condition in the if part is met; otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero by performing a specific operation multiple times.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and decrementing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1.
   - The goal is to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its intended purpose.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation while `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`.

4. **Issues in Function 2**:
   - The operation logic is incorrect. The decrement values should be fixed to 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not scaled by `list[i-1]`.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` should be `list[i] > 0` to ensure the operation can be applied even when `list[i]` is 1.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros correctly. It should check if the array can be reduced to all zeros without leaving any negative values.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the sum by 4).
   - Additionally, the function should ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros without any element becoming negative during the process.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in `func_2`, the program is **incorrect**.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 0 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_make_zero(arr, n)`**:
  - First, it checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it returns `False` because each operation reduces the sum by 4.
  - Then, it iterates through the array and applies the operation while the conditions are met.
  - Finally, it checks if all elements in the array are zero using the `all` function.
- **`solve(t, test_cases)`**:
  - It processes each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result of `can_make_zero`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect and needs to be fixed as shown above.)
