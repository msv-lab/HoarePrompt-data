Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - In `func_2`, the operation is applied incorrectly. The operation should be applied to the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the code incorrectly uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is not the correct way to perform the operation.
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The current implementation can lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are met but the operation is not correctly applied. For example, if `list[i]` is 3, `list[i-1]` is 1, and `list[i+1]` is 1, the loop will continue indefinitely because the operation does not actually change the values as intended.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, but it should be called after the operations are applied correctly to ensure all elements are zero.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be all zeros or where the operation cannot be applied to make all elements zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(a, n):
    # Calculate the total sum of the array
    total_sum = sum(a)
    
    # If the total sum is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to make all elements zero
    if total_sum % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if the array can be made zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a = test_cases[_]
        if can_make_zero(a, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

This corrected version ensures that the operation is applied correctly and checks if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made all zeros. It also correctly checks if all elements are zero after applying the operations.
