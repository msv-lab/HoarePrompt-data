Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic of `func_14`, which is responsible for generating the sequence based on the given `n` and `k`. The function attempts to construct a sequence by using powers of 2 and some additional values, but it does not ensure that the sequence meets the required conditions, especially the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling of `k == 1`**:
   - The function returns a sequence `[2, 3]` for `n > 2`, but this sequence does not cover all values from 1 to `n` except `k`. For example, for `n = 3`, the sequence `[2, 3]` does not have a subsequence that sums to 1 or 2.

2. **General Case**:
   - The function constructs a sequence by adding powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-1)` and then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`. This approach does not guarantee that the sequence will have subsequences that sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The sequence might not be of size at most 25, and it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

A correct approach would involve constructing a sequence that ensures all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence, while ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`. One possible correct solution is to use a combination of powers of 2 and carefully chosen additional values to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`.

Here is a corrected version of `func_14`:

```python
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    ans = []
    for i in range(20):  # Use up to 20 powers of 2
        if (k & (1 << i)) == 0:  # If k does not have this bit set
            ans.append(1 << i)
    if sum(ans) < n:
        ans.append(n - sum(ans))
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))

#Function 15:
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence `ans` does not include any bit that is set in `k`, thus no subsequence can sum to `k`. It also ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence. The sequence is guaranteed to be of size at most 21 (20 powers of 2 plus one additional value), which is within the allowed limit of 25.
