To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_14()` within the loop. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about these functions, we will assume that `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer representing the number of iterations, and `func_14()` returns a value that is printed to the standard output during each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

1. `func_10()` determines the number of iterations.
2. `func_14()` is called in each iteration and its return value is printed to the standard output.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for these functions, we will assume:
- `func_10()` returns `n` (a non-negative integer).
- `func_14()` returns `x` (an integer or string) in each iteration.

The loop will execute `n` times, and in each iteration, it will print the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character.

### Output State
Output State: **The loop will print the value returned by `func_14()` `n` times, each on a new line.**

If `func_10()` returns 0, the loop will not execute, and no output will be produced. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer `n`, the loop will execute `n` times, and the value returned by `func_14()` will be printed `n` times, each on a new line.
