The code snippet `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation as a string and removes the '0b' prefix. The variable `bk` now holds this binary string.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
