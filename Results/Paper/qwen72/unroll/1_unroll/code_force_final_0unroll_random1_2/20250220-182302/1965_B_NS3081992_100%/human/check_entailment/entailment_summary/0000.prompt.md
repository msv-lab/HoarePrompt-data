Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string.

Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns this integer value. The function is typically used to obtain the number of test cases or similar integer inputs from the user. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an integer value that was provided by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function concludes, the user's input is split into a list of strings, and this list is the final output of the function.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list `processing` initialized to 0, an integer key `da` present in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to 0. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`), and returns the minimum value of these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, it updates `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus 1. The lists `processing` and `rank` are modified during the function's execution, but `d` and `da` remain unchanged.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second values from the recursive call, respectively), and the third value from the recursive call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned the tuple `(x, y, g)`, which represents the coefficients and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` in the context of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]

        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. It internally uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7` where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, where `ans` is a list of the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements. If `k` is not 1, the function returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, where `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It prints the value returned by `func_14` a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10`, each value on a new line. The function does not return any specific value.
