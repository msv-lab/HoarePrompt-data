You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`), and returns the minimum value of these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, it updates `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus 1. The lists `processing` and `rank` are modified during the function's execution, but `d` and `da` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second values from the recursive call, respectively), and the third value from the recursive call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned the tuple `(x, y, g)`, which represents the coefficients and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` in the context of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k = 1 \) and \( n > 2 \) correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_14` for \( k = 1 \) is flawed. For example, when \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program should return a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to 3 except 1. However, the current implementation returns `[2, 3]`, which cannot form the sum 1. This violates the requirement that for all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there should be a subsequence of \( a \) with a sum of \( v \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
