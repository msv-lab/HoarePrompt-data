The only objects in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the result of the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, the function `func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0). The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0)**
