Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both dimensions are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle (e.g., 2x6 can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle).
   - The second condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is either `(-a, a)` or `(-b, b)`. This condition is incorrect and unnecessary. It seems to be an attempt to handle cases where one dimension is 1, but it is not formulated correctly.
   - The third condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. If it is, it prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because the difference being odd does not necessarily mean Bob can form a different rectangle. For example, for a 3x5 rectangle, the difference is 2, which is even, but Bob can still form a different rectangle (e.g., 3x5 can be cut into 3x2 and 3x3, and rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle).
   - The fourth condition (else) prints 'no'. This is incorrect because it will print 'no' for cases where Bob can actually form a different rectangle.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - Bob can form a different rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two smaller rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - The current logic in the function is flawed and does not correctly capture this condition.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
