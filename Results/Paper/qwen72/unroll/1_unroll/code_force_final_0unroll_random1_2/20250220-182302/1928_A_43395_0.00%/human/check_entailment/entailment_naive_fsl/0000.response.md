Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2 4
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
Actual Output:
```
no
```

For the input `2 4`, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `2 x 2` rectangles and then form a `4 x 2` rectangle, which is different from the original `2 x 4` rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "no" for this case. The conditions in the program do not correctly capture the logic for determining if another rectangle can be formed.
