### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different from the original if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle:
     - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - This condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If both are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This is correct.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and will always evaluate to `True` because they are non-empty. This condition should be simplified to check if \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, which would mean the rectangle cannot be cut into two different rectangles.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1 if \(a - b\) is negative). The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always be `True` because it covers all possible non-zero values. This condition should check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, which would mean Bob can form a new rectangle.
     - **Condition 4:** `else`
       - This condition will only be reached if the previous conditions are `False`. However, due to the incorrect conditions, this part of the logic is flawed.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other dimension is not 1.
   - This is because if both dimensions are even, he can cut the rectangle into two smaller even rectangles and form a new rectangle.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is greater than 1, he can cut the even dimension and form a new rectangle.

4. **Corrected Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       for i in range(int(input())):
           (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
           if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
               if a > 1 and b > 1:
                   print('yes')
               else:
                   print('no')
           else:
               print('no')
   ```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - The corrected program correctly checks if at least one dimension is even and the other is greater than 1.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle. The corrected program, as provided in the original assessment, correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
