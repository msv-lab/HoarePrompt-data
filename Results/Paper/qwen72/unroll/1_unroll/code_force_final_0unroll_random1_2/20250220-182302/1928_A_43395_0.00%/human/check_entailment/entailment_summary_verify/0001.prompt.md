You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a series of inputs from the user, where the first input specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. Based on the conditions provided, it prints 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of dimensions. The values of `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration, but no initial parameters are provided or modified. The function's purpose is to determine and print whether certain conditions related to the dimensions of the rectangle are met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different from the original if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle:
     - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - This condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If both are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This is correct.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and will always evaluate to `True` because they are non-empty. This condition should be simplified to check if \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, which would mean the rectangle cannot be cut into two different rectangles.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1 if \(a - b\) is negative). The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always be `True` because it covers all possible non-zero values. This condition should check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, which would mean Bob can form a new rectangle.
     - **Condition 4:** `else`
       - This condition will only be reached if the previous conditions are `False`. However, due to the incorrect conditions, this part of the logic is flawed.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other dimension is not 1.
   - This is because if both dimensions are even, he can cut the rectangle into two smaller even rectangles and form a new rectangle.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is greater than 1, he can cut the even dimension and form a new rectangle.

4. **Corrected Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       for i in range(int(input())):
           (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
           if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
               if a > 1 and b > 1:
                   print('yes')
               else:
                   print('no')
           else:
               print('no')
   ```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - The corrected program correctly checks if at least one dimension is even and the other is greater than 1.
