### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves by placing black rooks.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to precompute the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns) that are not yet occupied by rooks.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board where no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration (one rook).
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations (one rook in each cell of a 2x2 board, or two rooks in non-attacking positions).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`:
       - `dp[i - 1]`: Placing one rook in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.
       - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`: Placing two rooks in non-attacking positions in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, we read the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - We then read the \( k \) moves and add the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.
   - The number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows (or columns) is given by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0, there are no valid moves left, and the number of configurations is 1 (the current state).
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 1, there is only one valid configuration (one rook).

5. **Precomputation**:
   - The `func_1` function precomputes the DP values up to 300,000, which is sufficient given the constraints.
   - This ensures that the DP values are available for any test case within the given limits.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is a common practice in competitive programming.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for precomputing the DP values and calculating the final configurations is sound.

Correctness: **True**
