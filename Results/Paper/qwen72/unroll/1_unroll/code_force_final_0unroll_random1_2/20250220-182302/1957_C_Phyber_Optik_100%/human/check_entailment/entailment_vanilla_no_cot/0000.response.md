Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - It then iterates from 3 to `n` to fill the DP array using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation correctly counts the number of valid configurations for a board of size `i` by considering the placement of rooks in the last row and column.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied or mirrored.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n` and using the precomputed DP array to find the result.
   - The result is printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n - len(invalid)` is 0 or 1 correctly by returning the maximum of 1 and the DP value, which ensures that the result is always at least 1.

The program efficiently precomputes the DP values up to a large limit (300,000) and uses them to quickly solve each test case. The logic for handling the moves and calculating the final configurations is sound and aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
