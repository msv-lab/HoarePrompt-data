Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and computes a value `dp[n]` based on a dynamic programming approach. The final state of the program is that `dp[n]` holds the computed value, which is the result of a specific recurrence relation modulo 1000000007. The function does not return any value, but the computed `dp[n]` can be used for further processing or output. **
