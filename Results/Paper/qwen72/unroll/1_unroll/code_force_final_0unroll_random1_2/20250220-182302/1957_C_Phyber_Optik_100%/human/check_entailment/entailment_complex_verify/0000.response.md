Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized correctly to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of available rows/columns.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct. For a 1x1 board, there is only 1 way to place a rook (either white or black, but not both since they would attack each other). For a 2x2 board, there are 3 valid configurations: one white rook, one black rook, or both in different positions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is valid because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where no rook is placed in the i-th row/column.
     - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the configurations where a rook is placed in the i-th row and a rook is placed in the i-th column, but not both in the same position. This is because for each of the `i - 1` positions in the i-th row, there are `i - 1` positions in the i-th column that can be chosen, and each of these choices can be made in two ways (white rook in the row and black rook in the column, or vice versa).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns to the `invalid` set to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is done correctly by adding both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of available rows/columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`. This is correct because the `invalid` set contains all rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - It then prints the result from the `dp` array for the number of available rows/columns, ensuring the result is at least 1. This is a reasonable safeguard, but it is not strictly necessary since the `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1`, and the recurrence relation ensures that `dp[i]` is always at least 1 for `i >= 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `r = c` and the computer skips its turn. This is implicitly handled by the `invalid` set, which will not double-count the same row and column.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the board size `n` is 1, as the `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the input handling and final configuration calculation are implemented correctly.

Final: **True**
