The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in `s`. Given that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the loop will execute if `s` has at least one character.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` is non-empty and `char` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `unique_chars` minus 1, `char` is the first character of `s`**
