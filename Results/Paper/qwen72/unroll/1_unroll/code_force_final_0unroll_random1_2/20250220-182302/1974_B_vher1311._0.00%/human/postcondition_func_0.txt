The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all unique characters from `s`, sorted in ascending order. After the function concludes, the original string `s` is modified such that all characters are replaced by the last unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `s`. The list `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original string `s`, with some characters from `s` that were not initially in `unique_chars` possibly inserted at the beginning. The final state of the program is that `s` is a string where all characters have been replaced by the last unique character in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` is a list that may contain additional characters from `s` at the beginning.
