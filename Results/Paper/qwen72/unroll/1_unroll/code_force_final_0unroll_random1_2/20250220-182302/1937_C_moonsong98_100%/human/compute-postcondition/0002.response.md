Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and the current value of `n` is 2. `func_2(0, 1)` has been called, but no return or changes to variables are specified in the code snippet.**

The code snippet only shows a function call to `func_2` with arguments `0` and `1`. Since there is no information about the function `func_2` or any return values or changes to variables within the function, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.
