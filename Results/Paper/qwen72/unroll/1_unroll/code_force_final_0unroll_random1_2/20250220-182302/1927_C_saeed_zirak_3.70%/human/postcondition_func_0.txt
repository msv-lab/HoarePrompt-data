The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. It then checks if it is possible to select exactly `k // 2` unique integers from the first `k` integers (1 to `k`) that are present in both lists `a` and `b`. If such a selection is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output produced.
