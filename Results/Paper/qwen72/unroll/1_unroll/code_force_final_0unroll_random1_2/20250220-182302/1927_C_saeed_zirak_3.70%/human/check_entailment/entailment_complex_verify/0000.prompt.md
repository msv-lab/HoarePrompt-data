You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES

    NO
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

For each iteration of the loop, the variables aOnes and bOnes are updated based on the presence of integers from 1 to k in the lists a and b, respectively. After the loop, aOnes and bOnes are either equal to newk (k // 2) or not, and the output is 'yes' if both are equal to newk, otherwise 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. It then checks if it is possible to select exactly `k // 2` unique integers from the first `k` integers (1 to `k`) that are present in both lists `a` and `b`. If such a selection is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output produced.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where an integer from 1 to k is present in one of the arrays but not in the other, and the count of such integers exceeds the allowed limit of `k // 2` for that array. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4
```

In this case, the program will output "no" because it will try to distribute the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 between the two arrays. However, the correct output should be "yes" because we can choose 1 and 3 from the first array and 2 and 4 from the second array, which satisfies the condition. The program fails to correctly account for the distribution of numbers when they are not equally present in both arrays.
