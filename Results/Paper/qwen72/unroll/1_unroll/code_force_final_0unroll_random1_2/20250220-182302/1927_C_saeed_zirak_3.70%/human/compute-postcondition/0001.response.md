Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. For each iteration of the loop, the variables aOnes and bOnes are updated based on the presence of integers from 1 to k in the lists a and b, respectively. After the loop, aOnes and bOnes are either equal to newk (k // 2) or not, and the output is 'yes' if both are equal to newk, otherwise 'no'.**
