You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

For each iteration of the loop, the variables aOnes and bOnes are updated based on the presence of integers from 1 to k in the lists a and b, respectively. After the loop, aOnes and bOnes are either equal to newk (k // 2) or not, and the output is 'yes' if both are equal to newk, otherwise 'no'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to 0. These variables will keep track of how many elements from 1 to `k` are found in arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array.

3. **Iterating Over Elements:**
   - The program iterates over the integers from 1 to `k`.
   - For each integer `i`:
     - If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, it increments the count of the array with fewer elements found so far (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
     - If `i` is present only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
     - If `i` is present only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
     - If `i` is not found in either array, the loop breaks.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

### Potential Issues:
- **Breaking the Loop Early:**
  - The loop breaks as soon as an integer `i` from 1 to `k` is not found in either array. This is correct because if any integer from 1 to `k` is missing, it is impossible to choose the required elements.
- **Counting Elements:**
  - The program correctly ensures that it does not exceed `newk` elements from either array.
- **Output Format:**
  - The output is in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks whether it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements. The logic and flow of the program are sound, and it handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.
