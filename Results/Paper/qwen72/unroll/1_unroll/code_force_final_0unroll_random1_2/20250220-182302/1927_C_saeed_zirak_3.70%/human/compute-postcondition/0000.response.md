The only variable in the loop head is `t`, and the loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `t` is not relevant to the loop's execution since it will be overwritten by the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
