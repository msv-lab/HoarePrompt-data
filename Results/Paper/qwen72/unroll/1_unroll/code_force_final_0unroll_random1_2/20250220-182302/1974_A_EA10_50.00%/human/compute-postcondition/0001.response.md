To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(a):`, which means the loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99
- `a` is an input integer

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
