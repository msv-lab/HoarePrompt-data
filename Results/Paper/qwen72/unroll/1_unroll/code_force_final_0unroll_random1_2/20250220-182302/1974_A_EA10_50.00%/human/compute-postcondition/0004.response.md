Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `a` test cases, where `a` is an integer input by the user. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, performs calculations to determine a value `z`, and prints `z`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` are not retained, and the value of `a` remains unchanged. The function's primary purpose is to compute and print a specific value `z` for each test case based on the provided inputs `x` and `y`. **
