### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula is intended to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the formula aims to place as many 2x2 icons as possible on each screen.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula is intended to determine the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. The calculation `15 * z` gives the total number of cells on `z` screens, and `y * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The condition `if m < a` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. The correct condition should be `if m < x` to check if there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons.
   - If there are not enough remaining cells, the function calculates the additional number of screens required to place the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `z` for each test case, which is the total number of screens required.

### Correctness:

The program contains a logical error in the condition `if m < a`. The variable `a` should be replaced with `x` to correctly check if there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons. This error can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
