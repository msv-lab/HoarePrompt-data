You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input value processed. The variable `power` will be the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the last input `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the position of 1 in the resulting array is flawed. The program uses a logarithmic approach to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, but this does not accurately reflect the position of 1 after performing the swap operations as described in the problem.

For example, consider the input `n = 6`:

- Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(2)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(3)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(4)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(5)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(6)`, the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]`.

The final position of 1 is 6, but the program would incorrectly output `4` for this case. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the position of 1 in the array after all the swap operations.
