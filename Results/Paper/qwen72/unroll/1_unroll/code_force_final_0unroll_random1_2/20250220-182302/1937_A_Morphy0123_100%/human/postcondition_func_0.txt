The function reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input value processed. The variable `power` will be the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the last input `n`.
