Output State: **The loop will print the largest power of 2 less than or equal to each input `n` for `n_cases` iterations. The variable `n_cases` will remain unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input value processed by the loop. The variable `power` will be the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the last input `n`.**
