The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be called with a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on this implied parameter `n`.

Functionality: **The function is implied to accept an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and returns a value based on `n`.**
