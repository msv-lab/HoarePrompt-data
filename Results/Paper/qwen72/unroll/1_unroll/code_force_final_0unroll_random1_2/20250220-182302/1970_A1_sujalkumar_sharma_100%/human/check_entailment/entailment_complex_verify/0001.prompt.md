You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance at the start of the iteration, the index of the current character, and the current character itself; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string composed of the third elements of each tuple in `prefix_balance` concatenated together.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")", with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a string that is a rearranged version of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position. The returned string maintains the same characters as `s` but may have a different order, ensuring that the balance of parentheses is preserved.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `s` and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a standard and correct way to handle input, ensuring that the string is clean and ready for processing.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`. It also initializes a variable `balance` to 0. The program then iterates over the string `s` and for each character:
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance`.
   - It updates the `balance` by incrementing it if the character is '(', and decrementing it if the character is ')'.
   This correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means:
   - The list is first sorted by the prefix balance in ascending order.
   - If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   This sorting step is crucial and correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This is done using a list comprehension to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and then joining them into a single string.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description accurately and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
