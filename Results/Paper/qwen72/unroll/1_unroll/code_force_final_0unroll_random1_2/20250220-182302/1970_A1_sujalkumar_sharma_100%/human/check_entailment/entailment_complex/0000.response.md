Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program starts by taking a string `s` from the input and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. It is mentioned that `s` is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. This is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the prefix balance for each character in the string `s`. The prefix balance is updated correctly by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis '(' and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis ')'. The tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` is appended to the `prefix_balance` list, where `balance` is the current balance, `i` is the index of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.

3. **Sorting the Prefix Balance**: The `prefix_balance` list is sorted based on the balance value in ascending order and the index in descending order (to break ties). This sorting step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. The sorting key `lambda x: (x[0], -x[1])` ensures that characters with the same balance are ordered by their positions in reverse, which is correct according to the problem's requirements.

4. **Constructing the Result**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. The result string is formed by the third element of each tuple in the sorted list, which corresponds to the characters in the original string but in the new order determined by the sorting.

5. **Output**: The function returns the result string, which is then printed.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It maintains the balance of the parentheses sequence and ensures that the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

Correctness: **True**
