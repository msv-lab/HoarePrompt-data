### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function calculates the middle point `pk` of the village. However, the calculation is incorrect. The middle point should be `n // 2` for even `n` and `(n + 1) // 2` for odd `n`. The current implementation always uses `n / 2`, which is a floating-point division and should be an integer division.

3. **Counting Preferences:**
   - The function correctly counts the total number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the string `s`.

4. **Iterating Through Possible Road Positions:**
   - The function iterates through possible positions for the road (from 0 to `n-1`), updating the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side.
   - It checks if both percentages are at least 50% and adds the position to a list `lst` if the condition is met.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The function finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the middle of the village (`pk`).
   - If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall percentage of '1's in the village and prints 0 if the percentage is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where no valid positions are found by checking the overall preference and printing the appropriate result.

### Issues:
- **Middle Point Calculation:**
  - The middle point `pk` should be an integer. The current implementation uses floating-point division, which can lead to incorrect results. It should be `pk = n // 2` for even `n` and `pk = (n + 1) // 2` for odd `n`.

- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - The percentage calculation is unnecessary and can be simplified. Instead of calculating percentages, the function should directly check if the counts of '0's and '1's meet the required condition.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Calculate the middle point
        pk = (n + 1) // 2
        
        # Count the total number of '0's and '1's
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        
        # Initialize counts for '0's and '1's on the left and right sides
        zero = 0
        one = 0
        
        # List to store valid positions
        lst = []
        
        # Iterate through possible road positions
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            # Check if the current position is valid
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 + (i + 1) % 2 and (o - one) >= (n - i - 1) // 2 + (n - i - 1) % 2:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        # Find the position closest to the middle
        if lst:
            final = min(lst, key=lambda x: abs(pk - x))
        else:
            # If no valid positions, check the overall preference
            if o >= n // 2 + n % 2:
                final = 0
            else:
                final = n
        
        print(final)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program is left as is, due to the incorrect middle point calculation and unnecessary percentage calculations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the issues mentioned, the program needs to be corrected as described above).
