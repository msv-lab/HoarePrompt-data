Output State: **The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the smallest index (1-based) where the number of '0's and '1's on either side of the index (excluding the last house) are both at least 50% of the total number of houses on their respective sides. If no such index exists, it prints 0 if the total percentage of '1's is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n` (the total number of houses).**
