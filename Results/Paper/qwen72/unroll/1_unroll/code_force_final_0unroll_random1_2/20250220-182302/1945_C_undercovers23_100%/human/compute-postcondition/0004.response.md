Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. The function processes each test case to find the smallest index (1-based) where the number of '0's and '1's on either side of the index (excluding the last house) are both at least 50% of the total number of houses on their respective sides. If no such index exists, it prints 0 if the total percentage of '1's is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n` (the total number of houses). The function prints the result for each test case. **
