Functionality: ** The function reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` of length `n`. It calculates the minimum cost to move from the position `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the provided costs, and prints this minimum cost for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends. **
