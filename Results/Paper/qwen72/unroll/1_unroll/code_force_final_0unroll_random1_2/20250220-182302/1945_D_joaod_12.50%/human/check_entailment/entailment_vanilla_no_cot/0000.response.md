Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program attempts to iterate backward through the queue, calculating the cost of bribing each person. However, it does not correctly handle the dynamic nature of the problem, where the cost of bribing a person depends on the current position of Kirill and the positions of the people he is bribing.

The main issues are:
1. The program does not maintain a proper dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
2. The program does not correctly consider the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people to reach a target position.
3. The program does not handle the case where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to move to a position within the first `m` positions.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as a dynamic programming solution or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum costs effectively. The given program's logic is flawed and does not guarantee the correct minimum cost for Kirill to reach the desired position.
