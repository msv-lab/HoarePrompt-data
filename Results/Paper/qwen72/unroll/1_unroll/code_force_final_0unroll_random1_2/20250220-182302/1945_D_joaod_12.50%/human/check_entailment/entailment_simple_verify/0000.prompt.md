You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The loop has processed `cases` number of test cases. For each test case, it has read `na_frente` and `pos_final` as integers, and two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` of length `n`. It has then calculated the minimum cost to move from the position `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the provided costs, and printed this minimum cost. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` are reset for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, the loop has completed and the program has printed the minimum cost for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move to a position `j` that is less than his current position `i`, and it does not account for the additional costs `b_k` for each person between `j` and `i`.

Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

Expected Output:
```
14
```

Actual Output:
```
11
```

Explanation of the test case:
- Kirill starts at position 5 (after the 4th person).
- He wants to be among the first 2 people.
- The costs to move to each position are:
  - `a_1 = 7`, `a_2 = 3`, `a_3 = 6`, `a_4 = 9`
  - `b_1 = 4`, `b_2 = 3`, `b_3 = 8`, `b_4 = 5`

To move to position 2, Kirill can:
1. Move from position 5 to position 4, paying `a_4 = 9` coins.
2. Move from position 4 to position 3, paying `a_3 = 6` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.
3. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying `a_2 = 3` coins and `b_3 = 8` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.

The total cost for this sequence is:
- `9 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 36` coins.

However, a more optimal sequence is:
1. Move from position 5 to position 3, paying `a_3 = 6` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.
2. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying `a_2 = 3` coins and `b_3 = 8` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.

The total cost for this sequence is:
- `6 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 27` coins.

The program, however, calculates the cost as:
- `6 + 5 + 3 = 14` coins for the first move to position 3.
- It then incorrectly updates the `best` value to `11` when considering the move to position 2.

This is incorrect because the program does not account for the cumulative costs correctly when moving to positions within the first `m` people. The program should consider the total cost of all moves, including the intermediate costs `b_k`, to ensure the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
