### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of distinct subsequences of length `k` found in `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask `cur` to track the current subsequence being formed.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been included yet.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means a subsequence of length `k` has been found, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, the program prints 'NO' and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly uses `cnt` to count the number of distinct subsequences of length `k` found in `s`. However, the problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` (not `k`) occur as subsequences.
   - The program constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence, but it does so by adding a character not present in the current sequence and then appending 'a' characters. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is of length `n` and does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any of these strings is not a subsequence, we print 'NO' and the string that does not occur.
   - If all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, we print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It incorrectly counts subsequences of length `k` instead of checking all possible strings of length `n`. Additionally, the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**
