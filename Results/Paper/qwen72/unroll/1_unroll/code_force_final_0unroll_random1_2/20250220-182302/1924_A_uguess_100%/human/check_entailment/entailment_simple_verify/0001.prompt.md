You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has determined whether the string s contains at least n distinct subsequences of length k. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If it does not, it prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first character not present in the current sequence and enough 'a' characters to make the total count of distinct subsequences equal to n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences and `cur` to keep track of the current bitmask of characters encountered.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - It converts the character to its corresponding index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
     - It updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been included yet.
     - If `cur` has all `k` bits set (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - It appends the current character to `ans` if `cur` is updated.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is at least `n`:
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence:
       - It finds the first character that is not included in `cur` and appends it to `ans`.
       - It appends 'a' to `ans` until it reaches the required length `n`.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic for updating `cur` and `cnt` is incorrect. The program is trying to count the number of times all `k` characters appear in a sequence, but it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The program does not generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`.
   - The construction of the string that is not a subsequence is also flawed. It only appends the first missing character and then 'a', which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - For each generated string, we need to check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any generated string is not a subsequence, we print "NO" and the string.
   - If all generated strings are subsequences, we print "YES".

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The program's approach to counting and constructing the non-subsequence string is flawed.
