The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function, and it will increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0**
