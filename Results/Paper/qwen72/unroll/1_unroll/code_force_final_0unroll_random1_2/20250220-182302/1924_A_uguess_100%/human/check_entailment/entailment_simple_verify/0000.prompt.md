You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has determined whether the string s contains at least n distinct subsequences of length k. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If it does not, it prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first character not present in the current sequence and enough 'a' characters to make the total count of distinct subsequences equal to n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if a string of length `n` is a subsequence of `s`. It only checks if the current character in `s` is new (i.e., not seen before in the current `cur` bitmask) and updates the `cur` bitmask accordingly. This does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked as subsequences.

2. **Bitmask Logic**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not correctly handle the generation of all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` alphabets. The bitmask is reset to 0 when `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, which means it only tracks the presence of characters in a single window of `k` characters, not all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Output Logic**: When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences, it generates a string that is not necessarily a valid non-subsequence. The generated string is based on the current `cur` bitmask, which may not represent a valid non-subsequence of length `n`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`
- `s = "aabbccabab"`

The program should output:
```
NO
ccc
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
abc
```

This is incorrect because "ccc" is a valid string of length 3 that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`, but the program generates "abc" which does occur as a subsequence in `s`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
