### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences and `cur` to keep track of the current bitmask of characters encountered.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - It converts the character to its corresponding index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
     - It updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been included yet.
     - If `cur` has all `k` bits set (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - It appends the current character to `ans` if `cur` is updated.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is at least `n`:
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence:
       - It finds the first character that is not included in `cur` and appends it to `ans`.
       - It appends 'a' to `ans` until it reaches the required length `n`.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Bitmask Logic**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, the bitmask `cur` is reset to 0 after it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, which means it only tracks the presence of characters in a single segment of the string, not the entire string.
   - **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only counts the number of times all `k` characters appear in a sequence, which is not the same as checking all possible subsequences.
   - **Non-Subsequence String Construction**: The construction of the string that is not a subsequence is flawed. It only appends the first missing character and then 'a', which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - For each generated string, we need to check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any generated string is not a subsequence, we print "NO" and the string.
   - If all generated strings are subsequences, we print "YES".

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The program's approach to counting and constructing the non-subsequence string is flawed.
