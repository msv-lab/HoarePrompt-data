The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, representing the number of unique characters allowed in the string. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, representing the number of unique characters used in the string. `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, representing the length of the string `s`. `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of unique characters allowed, `k` is the number of unique characters used, `m` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
