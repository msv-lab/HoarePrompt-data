The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to two different leaves. If the distance to either of the two leaves is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters.
