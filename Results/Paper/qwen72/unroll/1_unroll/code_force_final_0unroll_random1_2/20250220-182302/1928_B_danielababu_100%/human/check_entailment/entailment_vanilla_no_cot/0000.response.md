Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions defined in the program are mostly for reading input and sorting lists, but none of them actually implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. Additionally, the functions `func_8` and `func_9` are calculating the product of elements in an array, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The program lacks the core algorithm needed to solve the given problem.
