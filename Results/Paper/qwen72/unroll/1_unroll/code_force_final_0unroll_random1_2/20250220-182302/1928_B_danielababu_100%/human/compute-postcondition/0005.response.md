Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first.**

In natural language: The program returns a list called `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the list `arr`. The cumulative products are calculated starting from the last element of `arr` and moving towards the first element. For example, if `arr` is `[2, 3, 4]`, then `ans` would be `[24, 12, 4]` because:
- The last element is 4, so the first element in `ans` is the product of all elements: 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.
- The second element in `ans` is the product of the last two elements: 3 * 4 = 12.
- The third element in `ans` is the last element itself: 4.
