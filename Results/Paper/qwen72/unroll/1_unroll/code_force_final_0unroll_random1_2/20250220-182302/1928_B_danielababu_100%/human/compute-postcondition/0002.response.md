The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must have at least one element, making `len(arr) - 1` at least `0`. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` must have at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
