The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, but it is not specified whether it is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `used` is an empty dictionary**
