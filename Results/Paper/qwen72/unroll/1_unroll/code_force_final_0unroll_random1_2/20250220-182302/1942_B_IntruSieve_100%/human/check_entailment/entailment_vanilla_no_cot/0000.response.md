Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the calculation of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the logic for determining the value to append to `mex` when `arr[i] <= 0` is incorrect. The program should correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` such that the MEX-based condition is satisfied for each element in `a`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    used = set()
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p.append(mex)
            used.add(mex)
            mex += 1
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        else:
            p.append(mex + arr[i])
            used.add(mex + arr[i])
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is the permutation we are constructing.
   - `used` is a set to keep track of the elements that have already been used in the permutation.
   - `mex` is the current MEX value, starting at 0.

2. **Loop through the array `a`**:
   - If `arr[i] >= 0`, it means the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `mex`, and the value `p[i]` should be `mex`. We append `mex` to `p`, mark it as used, and increment `mex` until it is no longer in `used`.
   - If `arr[i] < 0`, it means the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `mex + arr[i]`, and the value `p[i]` should be `mex + arr[i]`. We append `mex + arr[i]` to `p` and mark it as used.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, we print it as a space-separated string.

This corrected program should correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints.
