### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The goal is to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the above condition holds for all `i`.

2. **Understanding the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes a variable `minn` to 0, which represents the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the elements that have already been added to the permutation `p`.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the input array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means the current MEX value is greater than `p_i`. Therefore, the current `minn` value is added to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented to the next unused value.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it means the current MEX value is less than or equal to `p_i`. The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is added to `mex`, and this value is marked as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The use of the `used` dictionary ensures that each element added to `mex` is unique and forms a valid permutation.
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` in the correct format for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `arr[i]` is non-positive by correctly calculating the value to be added to `mex`.
   - The program also handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive by correctly adding the current MEX value.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the `used` dictionary and the `mex` list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and satisfies all the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
