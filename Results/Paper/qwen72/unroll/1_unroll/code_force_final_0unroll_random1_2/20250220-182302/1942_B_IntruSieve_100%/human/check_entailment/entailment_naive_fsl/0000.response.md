Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization and Basic Logic**:
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` as 0.
   - It also initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of used elements.

2. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the input array:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and marks `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used.
   - This logic does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given `a`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 -2 1 2
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     0 1 3 2 4
     ```
   - However, the correct output should be:
     ```
     0 1 4 2 3
     ```
   - Let's verify the output:
     - For `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`:
       - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
       - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
       - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
       - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
       - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`
     - The program's output `p = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]` does not satisfy the conditions:
       - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -1` (not -2)
       - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2) - 2 = 1` (correct)
       - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2, 4) - 4 = 0` (not 2)

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
