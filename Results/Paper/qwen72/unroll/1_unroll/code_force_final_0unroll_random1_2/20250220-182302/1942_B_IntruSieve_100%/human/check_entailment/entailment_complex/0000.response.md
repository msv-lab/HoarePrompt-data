Reasoning:

The program is designed to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem description. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Processing the Array `a`**: The program maintains a list `mex` to store the permutation `p` and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the integers that have already been used in the permutation. It also maintains a variable `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used yet.
3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it adds the current `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used. Then, it increments `minn` to the next smallest unused non-negative integer.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it calculates the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and adds this value to `mex` and marks it as used.
4. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step-by-step:

- **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` as an empty list, `minn` as 0, and `used` as an empty dictionary. This is correct because `minn` starts at 0, and `used` should initially have no elements.
- **Positive `arr[i]` Handling**: When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly adds the current `minn` to `mex` and marks it as used. This is because the MEX of the prefix of `p` up to the current index `i` should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, and `minn` is exactly that.
- **Non-Positive `arr[i]` Handling**: When `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and adds this value to `mex`. This is based on the formula \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Rearranging this, we get \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \). Since `minn` is the current MEX, the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` should be the correct value for `p_i`.
- **Marking Used Values**: The program correctly marks the added values as used in the `used` dictionary, ensuring that the same value is not added again.
- **Incrementing `minn`**: The program increments `minn` to the next smallest unused non-negative integer after each positive `arr[i]` is processed. This ensures that `minn` always represents the current MEX correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle the construction of the permutation `p` correctly. The logic for both positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values is sound and aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
