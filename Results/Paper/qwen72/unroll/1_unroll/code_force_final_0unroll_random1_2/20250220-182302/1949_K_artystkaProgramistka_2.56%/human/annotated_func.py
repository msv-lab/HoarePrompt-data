#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b, c):
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the conditions (a + b > c), (a + c > b), and (b + c > a) are all true, based on the positive integer values of a, b, and c.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It returns `True` if the sum of any two of these integers is greater than the third integer, and `False` otherwise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has evaluated the conditions and returned a boolean result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2, and na + nb + nc = n. numbers is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= numbers[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain the same. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the numbers from the `numbers` list distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Each list contains numbers from the original `numbers` list, distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) such that the lengths of these groups are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. The function aims to distribute the numbers so that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`. If the distribution meets the criteria as determined by an external function `func_1`, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The original parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the `numbers` list is sorted in descending order.
