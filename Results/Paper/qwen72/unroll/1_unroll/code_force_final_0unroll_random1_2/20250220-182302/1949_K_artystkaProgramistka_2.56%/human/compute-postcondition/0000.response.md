The code snippet `numbers.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `numbers` in descending order. This impacts the order of elements in the `numbers` list but does not change the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, or `nc`.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2, and na + nb + nc = n. `numbers` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= numbers[i] <= 10^9, sorted in descending order.**
