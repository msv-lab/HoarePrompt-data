Postcondition: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain the same. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the numbers from the `numbers` list distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is false.**
