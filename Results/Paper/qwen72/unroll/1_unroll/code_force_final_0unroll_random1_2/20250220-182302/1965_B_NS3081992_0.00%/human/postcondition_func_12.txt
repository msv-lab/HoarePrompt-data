The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not 0). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `x` and `y` are integers, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and uses the results to compute the final tuple. The final state of the program is that the function has returned a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = g`, and `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
