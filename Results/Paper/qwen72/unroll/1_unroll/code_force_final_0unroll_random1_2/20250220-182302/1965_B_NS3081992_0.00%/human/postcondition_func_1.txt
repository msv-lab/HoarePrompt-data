The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input (stdin), splits the line by whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns an iterator that yields these integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the iterator is available for use, containing the integer values from the input line.
