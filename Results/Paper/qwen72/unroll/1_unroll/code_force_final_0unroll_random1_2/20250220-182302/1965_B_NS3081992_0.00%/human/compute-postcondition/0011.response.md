Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the new `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of the new `k` without the '0b' prefix.** 

The code snippet `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the value of `k` to its binary representation and assigns it to `bk` without the '0b' prefix. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged from the initial state, but `bk` now holds the binary representation of `k`.
