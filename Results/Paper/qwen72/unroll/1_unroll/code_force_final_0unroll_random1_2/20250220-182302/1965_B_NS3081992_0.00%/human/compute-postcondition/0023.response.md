The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function uses or relies on two integer values, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

Output:
- **Case_1**: The function returns the string `'1\n2'`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers. If `k` is 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains:
  - Powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(lk-2)}\),
  - Followed by the value \(k - 1 - \sum(2^0 \text{ to } 2^{(lk-2)})\),
  - Then `k + 1`,
  - Followed by `2 * k + 1`,
  - And finally, powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{(l-1)}\).

Functionality: **The function returns a string. In Case_1, it returns the string '1\n2'. In Case_2, it returns a space-separated list of integers. If `k` is 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(lk-2)}\), followed by the value \(k - 1 - \sum(2^0 \text{ to } 2^{(lk-2)})\), then `k + 1`, followed by `2 * k + 1`, and finally, powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{(l-1)}\).**
