The code snippet `ans.append(2 * k + 1)` appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged. The new value appended to `ans` is `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, followed by the value `k + 1`, and then the value `2 * k + 1`.**
