Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It returns a string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string, followed by `sym`, and the final `sym` is included at the end of the string. The list `arr` and the string `sym` remain unchanged. **
