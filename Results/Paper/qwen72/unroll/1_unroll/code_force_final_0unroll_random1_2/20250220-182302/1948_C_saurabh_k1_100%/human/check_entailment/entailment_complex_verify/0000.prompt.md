You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second and third lines of each test case are strings of length n, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. After processing, it prints 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained between iterations, so their final values are not defined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the loop completes without altering the initial constraints on `t` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if there is any position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'. If such a position is found, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such position is found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any state between test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reinitialized for each test case. The function completes without altering the initial constraints on `t` and `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the correct movement logic for the robot, especially the requirement that the robot must move along the arrow in the current cell after making its own move. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
4
><<<
><>>
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
```

In this case, the robot can reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (robot's move)
3. Move left to (1, 1) (arrow move)
4. Move down to (2, 1) (robot's move)
5. Move right to (2, 2) (arrow move)
6. Move right to (2, 3) (robot's move)
7. Move right to (2, 4) (arrow move)

The program incorrectly prints "No" because it does not properly simulate the robot's movement and the arrow's direction.
