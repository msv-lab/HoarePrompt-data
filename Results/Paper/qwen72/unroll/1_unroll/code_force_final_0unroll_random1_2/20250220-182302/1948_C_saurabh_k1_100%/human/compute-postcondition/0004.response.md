Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if there is any position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'. If such a position is found, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such position is found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any state between test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reinitialized for each test case. The function completes without altering the initial constraints on `t` and `n`. **
