Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. After processing, it prints 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained between iterations, so their final values are not defined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and the loop completes without altering the initial constraints on `t` and `n`.**
