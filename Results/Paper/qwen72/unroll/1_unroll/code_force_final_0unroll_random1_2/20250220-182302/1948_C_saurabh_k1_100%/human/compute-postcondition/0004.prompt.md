You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second and third lines of each test case are strings of length n, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. After processing, it prints 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained between iterations, so their final values are not defined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the loop completes without altering the initial constraints on `t` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and an even integer `n`, along with two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It returns a result based on the input parameters and the strings provided.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
