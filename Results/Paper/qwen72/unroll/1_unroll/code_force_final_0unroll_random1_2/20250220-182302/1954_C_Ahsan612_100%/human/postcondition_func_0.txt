The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9) as lists of digits. It then constructs two new lists of digits: the first list contains the maximum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the minimum digit for the remaining positions; the second list contains the minimum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The function prints these two lists as strings for each test case. The function does not return any value. After execution, the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but the function has processed `t` test cases and printed the results.
