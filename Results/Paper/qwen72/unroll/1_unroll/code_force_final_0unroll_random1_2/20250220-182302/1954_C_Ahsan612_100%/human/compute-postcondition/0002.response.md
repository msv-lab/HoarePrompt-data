The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Assuming the function returns some result based on the relationship between `x` and `y` for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
