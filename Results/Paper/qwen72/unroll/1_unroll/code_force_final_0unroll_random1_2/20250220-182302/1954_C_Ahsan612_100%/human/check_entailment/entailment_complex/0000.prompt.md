Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case, where 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two lines of input representing the integers `x` and `y` as lists of digits. For each pair of integers, it will print two lines: the first line will be the maximum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will be the minimum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged, but the loop will have processed `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9) as lists of digits. It then constructs two new lists of digits: the first list contains the maximum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the minimum digit for the remaining positions; the second list contains the minimum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The function prints these two lists as strings for each test case. The function does not return any value. After execution, the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but the function has processed `t` test cases and printed the results.
