You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two lines of input representing the integers `x` and `y` as lists of digits. For each pair of integers, it will print two lines: the first line will be the maximum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will be the minimum digit at each position until the first differing digit, followed by the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged, but the loop will have processed `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for swapping digits to maximize the product is flawed. The program only swaps the first differing digit and then assigns the minimum of the remaining digits to `new` and the maximum to `new2`. This approach does not guarantee that the product of `x` and `y` is maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
34
43
```
The program will output:
```
43
34
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
33
44
```
By swapping the digits in this manner, the product is maximized (33 * 44 = 1452, whereas 43 * 34 = 1462, which is not the maximum possible product). The program fails to consider the optimal swaps for maximizing the product.
