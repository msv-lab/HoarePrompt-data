### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then iterates through the list to process each test case. The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (length of the encoded string) and the string `b` (the encoded string).
   - The input handling is correct and efficient for large inputs, as it avoids multiple I/O operations.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking all distinct characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order.
   - The set of characters from `b` ensures that all characters are distinct, and sorting them in alphabetical order is correct according to the problem description.
   - The mapping dictionary is constructed by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to its symmetric character. The expression `r[-(i + 1)]` correctly maps the i-th character to the (len(r) - i - 1)-th character.
   - The program then decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary. This is done using a generator expression inside `join`, which is efficient and correct.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are collected in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in a batch, which is efficient for large inputs.
  - The use of `index` to track the position in the input list is appropriate and ensures that the input is read correctly.

- **Auxiliary String Construction:**
  - The auxiliary string `r` is constructed by taking the set of characters from the encoded string `b`, which ensures that all characters are distinct.
  - The set is then sorted to get the characters in alphabetical order, which is correct according to the problem description.

- **Mapping Construction:**
  - The mapping dictionary is constructed by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to its symmetric character.
  - The expression `r[-(i + 1)]` correctly maps the i-th character to the (len(r) - i - 1)-th character.
  - This ensures that the first character in `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on, which is the required behavior for decoding.

- **Decoding:**
  - The program correctly decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.
  - The use of a generator expression inside `join` is efficient and correct, ensuring that the decoded string is constructed properly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem. It handles the input and output efficiently and constructs the auxiliary string and mapping correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
