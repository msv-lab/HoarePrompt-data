Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Constructing `r`**: The program constructs the string `r` by taking all distinct characters from the encoded string `b`, sorting them, and joining them into a single string.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - **Decoding the String**: It decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them, each on a new line.

This approach ensures that the original string `s` is correctly restored from the encoded string `b` for each test case. The program handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description.
