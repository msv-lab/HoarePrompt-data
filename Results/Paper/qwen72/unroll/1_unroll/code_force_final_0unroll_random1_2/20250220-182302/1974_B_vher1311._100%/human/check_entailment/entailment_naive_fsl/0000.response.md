Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for decoding the string. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the distinct characters of the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order. It then creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding mapped character. This approach ensures that the decoding is done correctly for every potential case, as it handles all the requirements specified in the problem description.
