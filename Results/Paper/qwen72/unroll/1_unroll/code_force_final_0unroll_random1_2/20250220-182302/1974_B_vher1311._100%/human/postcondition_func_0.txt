The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in a mapping. This mapping is created by sorting the unique characters in `encoded` and then pairing each character with its reverse counterpart in the sorted list. The final state of the program is that the original string `encoded` is transformed into a new string based on this mapping.
