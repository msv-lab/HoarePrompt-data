Output State: `n` remains the same integer value input by the user, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the connected nodes (0-based) as specified by the input pairs `(u, v)` during the loop iterations. Each pair `(u, v)` results in `v` being appended to `u2vs[u]` and `u` being appended to `u2vs[v]`. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the number of connections for the corresponding node.
