Output State: **The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, where 1 \leq |s| \leq 500. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 500.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` based on user input, which is converted to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` should be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. After executing the code, `t` is now an integer within this range, and the other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
