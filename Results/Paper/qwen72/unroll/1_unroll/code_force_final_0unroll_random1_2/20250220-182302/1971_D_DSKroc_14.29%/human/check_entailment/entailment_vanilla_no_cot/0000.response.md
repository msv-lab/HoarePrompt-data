Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the binary string `s`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character is greater than the next character. Since the string consists only of '0' and '1', this condition is true only when the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'.
   - If the condition is true, it increments the counter `count` by 1. This counter tracks the number of cuts needed to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed. The `+1` accounts for the fact that the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum number of pieces for each test case.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
