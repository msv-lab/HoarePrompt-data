Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates the number of positions in `s` where a character is greater than the character immediately following it, and prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `t` remains unchanged, `s` contains the last input string, and `count` contains the last calculated count plus one. **
