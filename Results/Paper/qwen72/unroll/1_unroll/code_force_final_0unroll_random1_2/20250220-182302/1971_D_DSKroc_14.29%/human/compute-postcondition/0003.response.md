The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1', where the length of `s` is between 1 and 500 characters. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input string `s`.

However, the provided function signature does not explicitly show the parameters `t` and `s`. Assuming the function is designed to handle these inputs, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input string `s`.**
