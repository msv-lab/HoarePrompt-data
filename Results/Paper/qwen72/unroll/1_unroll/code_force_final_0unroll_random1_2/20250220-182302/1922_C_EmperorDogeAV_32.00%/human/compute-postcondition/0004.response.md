The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order, where the number of cities `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `prog_cities` which contains `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the distance to the next city in the `cities` list, depending on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in ascending order and an integer `n`, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the distance to the next city, based on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.**
