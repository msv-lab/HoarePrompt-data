The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in ascending order and an integer `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the next city in the `cities` list if that distance is less than or equal to the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it is 1.
