The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
