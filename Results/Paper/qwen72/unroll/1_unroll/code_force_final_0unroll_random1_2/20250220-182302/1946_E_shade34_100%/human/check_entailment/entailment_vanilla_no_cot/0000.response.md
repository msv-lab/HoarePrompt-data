Correctness: **False**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly solve the problem of counting the number of permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. These functions appear to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the multiplicative inverse in modular arithmetic. However, they are not used in a way that would help solve the given problem.

To solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Identify the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
2. Use combinatorial methods to count the number of valid permutations.
3. Ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The functions provided do not address these steps. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
