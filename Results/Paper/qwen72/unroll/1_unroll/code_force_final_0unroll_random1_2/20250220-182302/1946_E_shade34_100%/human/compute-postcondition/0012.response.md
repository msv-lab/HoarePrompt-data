The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with the constraint that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If `a` and `b` meet the initial constraints, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2**: If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is not equal to 0, the function returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`.
- **Case_3**: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to 0, the function returns a tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, where the first element is 1 and the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, minus 1.
- **Case_4**: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to 0, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `d` and `c` are the values returned by the function `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d` from `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where `a` >= `b` and `b` >= 0. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1, 0) if `a` and `b` meet the initial constraints; the values of `d` and `c` from `func_1(b, a)` if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is not 0; (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not 0; or (d, c - a // b * d) where `d` and `c` are from `func_1(b, a % b)` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not 0.**
