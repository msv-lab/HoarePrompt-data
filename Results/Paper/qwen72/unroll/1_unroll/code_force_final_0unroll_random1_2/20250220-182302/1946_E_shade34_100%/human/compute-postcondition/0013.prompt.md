You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b and b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b and b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `a` being less than `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b and b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b.
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the first element is 1 and the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus 1.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b and b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b.
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is the second value returned by `func_1`, and `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d` from `c`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where `a` >= `b` and `b` >= 0. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1, 0) if `a` and `b` meet the initial constraints; the values of `d` and `c` from `func_1(b, a)` if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is not 0; (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not 0; or (d, c - a // b * d) where `d` and `c` are from `func_1(b, a % b)` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is not 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `a` being less than `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the first element is 1 and the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus 1.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is the second value returned by `func_1`, and `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d` from `c`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
