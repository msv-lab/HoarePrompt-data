### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in the list `facts`.
   - This is necessary for calculating combinations and permutations efficiently.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, and `m2` (the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively).
   - It then reads the lists `p` and `s` containing the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`.
   - If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, indicating no valid permutation exists.

5. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2(a, b)` is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then returns \((c \cdot a) \mod 1000000007\).
   - This function is used to calculate combinations and permutations efficiently.

6. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums (excluding the last one) and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
   - The final result is the product of all these counts, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the permutation length is 1 or where the indices of prefix and suffix maximums do not align with the conditions.

### Function Analysis:

- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `x` and `y` such that \(a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The function returns the modular inverse of `b` when `a` is \(10^9 + 7\).

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then returns \((c \cdot a) \mod 1000000007\).
  - It is used to calculate combinations and permutations efficiently.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly precomputes factorials and uses them to calculate combinations and permutations.
- The validation checks ensure that the indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the problem constraints.
- The combination and permutation calculations are performed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
