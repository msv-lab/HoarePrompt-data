### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided functions in detail.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices for prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
- The indices of prefix maximums are in increasing order, and the indices of suffix maximums are in increasing order.
- The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

#### Function Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - This function appears to be an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( c \) and \( d \) such that \( a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b) \).
  - It is used to find the modular inverse in `func_2`.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - This function computes the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
  - It uses `func_1` to find the coefficients and then returns the modular inverse.

#### Algorithm for Counting Permutations:
- The key insight is that the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must be placed in specific positions in the permutation.
- The prefix maximums must be in increasing order, and the suffix maximums must be in decreasing order.
- The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

#### Program Evaluation:
- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly used to solve the permutation problem.
- The program does not contain any logic to process the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the permutations.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are typically used for modular arithmetic, which might be relevant in some problems but not in this specific permutation counting problem.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct. The provided functions do not address the problem of counting permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions provided are not used in the context of solving the problem.
