The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is an integer, and `b` is a list of integers with a minimum length of 1. The function returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is a value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a minimum length of 1), and returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is a value obtained from calling `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.**
