Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for some test cases. The logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color does not correctly account for the number of diagonals and their distribution in a grid.

### Explanation:
- A square grid of size \( n \times n \) has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
- The diagonals can be categorized into two types: main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) and anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left).
- Each cell in the grid is part of exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.
- To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to consider the optimal way to color cells such that they cover the maximum number of diagonals.

### Issues in the Program:
1. The condition `if k == 1:` is unnecessary because \( k \) is always at least 1, and the minimum number of cells to color for \( k = 1 \) is 1, which is already covered by the general logic.
2. The condition `if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):` is incorrect. The expression `2 * (n + (n - 2))` simplifies to `4n - 4`, which is not the correct threshold for determining the number of cells to color.
3. The logic `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` is incorrect for some cases. For example, when \( k \) is greater than \( 2n - 1 \) but less than \( 4n - 2 \), the program does not correctly handle the distribution of cells to cover the required diagonals.

### Correct Approach:
- For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and we need to cover \( k \) diagonals.
- For \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to cover more than half of the diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells to color is \( k - n + 1 \). This is because the first \( n - 1 \) cells can cover \( 2n - 2 \) diagonals, and the remaining \( k - (2n - 2) \) diagonals can be covered by additional cells.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k - n + 1)
```

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
