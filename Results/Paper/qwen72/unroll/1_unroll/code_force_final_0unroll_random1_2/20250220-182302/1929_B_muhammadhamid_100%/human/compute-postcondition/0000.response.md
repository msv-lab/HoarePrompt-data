The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop control variable. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. The loop control variable `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration, but its initial value is not specified in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
