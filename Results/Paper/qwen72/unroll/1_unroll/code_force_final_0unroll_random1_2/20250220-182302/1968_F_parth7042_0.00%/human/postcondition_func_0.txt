The function `func_1` reads input data and processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes an array `a` of `n` elements and `q` queries. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` representing a subarray range. The function determines if the XOR of the elements in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, with an empty string separating the results of different test cases. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
