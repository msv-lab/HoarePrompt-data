Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the condition for determining if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values is not correctly implemented. The program checks if there are indices `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` such that `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, but this does not guarantee that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```
The subarray from index 1 to 5 is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The XOR of the entire subarray is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 = 1 ^ 7 = 6`. There is no way to split this subarray into parts where the XOR of each part is equal. However, the program will incorrectly output "YES" for this query because it finds indices that satisfy the condition `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`.

This test case demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
