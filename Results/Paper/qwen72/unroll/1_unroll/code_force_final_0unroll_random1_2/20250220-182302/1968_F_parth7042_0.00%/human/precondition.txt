t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and q are integers where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, representing the elements of the array. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 <= l < r <= n, indicating the subarray a_l to a_r. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.
