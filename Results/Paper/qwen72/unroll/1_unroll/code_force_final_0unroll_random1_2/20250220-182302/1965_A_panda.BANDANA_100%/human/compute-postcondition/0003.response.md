The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `piles`, a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each inner list should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and each integer `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the number of stones in each pile, and the return value is not specified in the given output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the number of stones in the piles.**
