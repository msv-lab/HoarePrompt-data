The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then determines and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case based on the following rules: If the list of unique stone counts does not contain 1 or has only one unique value, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive unique stone counts, 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed based on the parity of the index of the gap. If no such gap exists, 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed based on the parity of the length of the unique stone counts. The function does not return any value.
