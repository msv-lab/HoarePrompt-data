### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000. This is a valid choice because `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. **Construction of `a` array:**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i < n`.
   - This construction ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` by at least `x[i-1]`, which means `a[i] % a[i-1]` will always be `x[i-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a` for each test case, which should satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is checked.
   - Since `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, it follows that `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`, which is exactly what the problem requires.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. For example, if `x = [500]`, the program will output `a = [1000, 1500]`, and `1500 % 1000 = 500`, which satisfies the condition.

6. **Constraints:**
   - The values of `a_i` are within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, which is valid according to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` for each test case and ensures that the conditions `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` are satisfied for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
