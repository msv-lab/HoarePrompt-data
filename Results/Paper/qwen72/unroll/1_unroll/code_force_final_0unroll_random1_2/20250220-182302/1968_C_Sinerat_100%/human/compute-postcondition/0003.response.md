Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `x`. It then constructs an array `a` of `n` elements where `a[0]` is set to 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 â‰¤ i < n) is the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]`. The function prints the elements of `a` for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. **
