The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for handling multiple test cases. The parameters are as follows:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
  - `a`: a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
  - `m`: an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `queries`: a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the minimum travel cost between the two cities specified in the query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. For each query, it returns the minimum travel cost between the two specified cities.**
