The function should take a list of strings as input, where each string represents a row in the n x n binary grid, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1. The function should return "SQUARE" if the shape is a square, and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
