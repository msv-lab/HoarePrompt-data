The function `func` accepts a list of strings, where each string represents a row in an n x n binary grid. The grid size n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one shape, which can be either a triangle or a square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1. The function returns "SQUARE" if the shape is a square, and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
