You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, representing the number of grids to process. For each grid, it reads `n` (an integer) from the user, where `n` is the size of the n x n binary grid. It then reads `n` strings, each representing a row in the grid. The function counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the count of '1's in the first row that contains '1's is equal to the count in the second row, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. After processing each grid, the function resets and continues to the next grid. The value of `a` remains unchanged throughout the function execution. The function does not return any value; it only prints the shape for each grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input. It first reads the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal:
     - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
     - If they are not equal, it prints "TRIANGLE".

3. **Shape Characteristics**:
   - A square has the same number of '1's in each row.
   - A triangle has an increasing or decreasing number of '1's in consecutive rows, starting from 1 and increasing by 2 (or decreasing by 2 for an upside-down triangle).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the size of the shape is greater than 1.
   - The program does not handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle, but it should still work correctly because the first two rows of an upside-down triangle will not have the same number of '1's.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that the first two rows with '1's will be sufficient to determine the shape. This assumption is correct for the given problem constraints because:
     - For a square, all rows will have the same number of '1's.
     - For a triangle, the number of '1's in the first two rows will be different (1 and 3, or 3 and 1 for an upside-down triangle).

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should correctly identify the shape in all valid test cases.

Correctness: **True**
