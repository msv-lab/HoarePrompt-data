To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's break down the code and understand its behavior:

1. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs `a` times.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row in an n x n binary grid.
3. **Shape Detection**: The inner loop checks if each row contains a '1' and counts the number of '1's in that row. These counts are stored in the list `k`.
4. **Shape Comparison**: After reading all rows, if the first and second counts in `k` are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

Given the initial state, the function reads a list of strings representing the grid and an integer `a`. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The loop will run `a` times, and for each iteration, it will read a new grid and determine the shape.

Since the grid is read and processed in each iteration of the outer loop, the list `k` is reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration. Therefore, the state of `k` at the end of each iteration will be a list containing the counts of '1's in the rows of the current grid.

However, the variables `a` and the input grid remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Output State Calculation

- **`a`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`k`**: After each iteration of the outer loop, `k` will be reset to an empty list.
- **`b`**: This variable is used to store each row of the grid during the inner loop, but it is not retained after the inner loop completes.
- **Shape Output**: The loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the counts of '1's in the rows of the grid.

### Final Output State

Since `a` and the input grid are not modified, and `k` is reset to an empty list after each iteration of the outer loop, the output state will be:

Output State: **The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is an empty list after each iteration of the outer loop. The function will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each grid based on the counts of '1's in the rows.**
