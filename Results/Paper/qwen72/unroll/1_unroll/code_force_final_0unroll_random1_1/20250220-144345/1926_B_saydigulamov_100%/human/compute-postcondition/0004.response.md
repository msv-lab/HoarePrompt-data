Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, representing the number of grids to process. For each grid, it reads `n` (an integer) from the user, where `n` is the size of the n x n binary grid. It then reads `n` strings, each representing a row in the grid. The function counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the count of '1's in the first row that contains '1's is equal to the count in the second row, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. After processing each grid, the function resets and continues to the next grid. The value of `a` remains unchanged throughout the function execution. The function does not return any value; it only prints the shape for each grid. **
