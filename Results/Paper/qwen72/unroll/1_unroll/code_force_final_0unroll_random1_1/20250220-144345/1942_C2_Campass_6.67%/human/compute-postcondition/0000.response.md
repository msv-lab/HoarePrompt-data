Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that it should handle multiple test cases, each with inputs `n`, `x`, and `y` where `n` is the number of sides of a regular polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). Additionally, `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` are provided, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The `R` function is now defined as a lambda function that maps input values to integers, splitting them by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The `R` function is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each split value to an integer.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the definition of `R`.
- The `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen are not affected by the definition of `R`.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `x`, and `y` remain valid.
- The initial state condition for the `x` distinct integers remains valid.
