You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:

    #State: `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is the bitwise complement of an integer in `a` that has not been completely paired, with values representing the count of these complements.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` after processing the list to account for bitwise complements. Specifically, it counts the unique integers in `a` and adjusts the count based on the presence of their bitwise complements. The final state of the program is that `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a` that do not have a complete pair of their bitwise complements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of groups.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) to be in the same group, their 31 least significant bits must be different in every position.
   - This means that if \( x \) and \( y \) are in the same group, then \( x \oplus y \) (bitwise XOR) must have all 31 bits set to 1.
   - The number \( (1 << 31) - 1 \) is a 32-bit number with all 31 least significant bits set to 1 (i.e., \( 2^{31} - 1 \) or \( 0x7FFFFFFF \)).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of groups.
   - The function uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of the numbers and their complements.
   - For each number \( num \) in the input list \( a \):
     - It checks if \( num \) is already in the dictionary.
     - If \( num \) is not in the dictionary, it adds the complement \( (1 << 31) - 1 \oplus num \) to the dictionary and increments the result `res`.
     - If \( num \) is in the dictionary, it decrements the count of \( num \) and removes it from the dictionary if the count becomes zero.

4. **Issues with the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm does not correctly handle the condition that no two numbers in the same group can have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The algorithm only checks if a number or its complement is in the dictionary, which is not sufficient to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
   - The complement \( (1 << 31) - 1 \oplus num \) is used to check if there is a number in the dictionary that can be paired with \( num \) to form a valid group. However, this does not guarantee that all pairs in the group will have different bits.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would be to use a set to keep track of the numbers that have already been placed in a group.
   - For each number \( num \), check if there is any number in the set that can be paired with \( num \) to form a valid group.
   - If no such number exists, create a new group and add \( num \) to the set.
   - If a valid pair is found, add \( num \) to the existing group and remove the paired number from the set.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
