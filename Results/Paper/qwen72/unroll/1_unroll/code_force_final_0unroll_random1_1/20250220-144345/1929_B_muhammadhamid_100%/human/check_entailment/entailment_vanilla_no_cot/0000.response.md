Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum number of cells to be colored. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \) by printing 1. This is correct because coloring one cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.

2. **General Case**:
   - The program uses the condition `if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):` to determine the number of cells to color. However, this condition is incorrect.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \). The program should check if \( k \) is within this range.
   - The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` is used to calculate the number of cells to color. This formula is not always correct. For example, if \( k \) is 4 and \( n \) is 3, the correct answer is 2, but the program will print 2, which is correct in this specific case but not always.

3. **Handling \( k > 2n - 1 \)**:
   - The program uses the condition `else: print(k // 2 + 1)`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of cells needed to cover the remaining diagonals.
   - For \( k > 2n - 1 \), the correct approach is to color cells in such a way that they cover the maximum number of diagonals. This can be achieved by coloring cells along the main diagonals and then adding additional cells as needed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- **For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \)**: The minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.
- **For \( k > 2n - 1 \)**: We need to cover the remaining diagonals. The correct formula is \( n + (k - 2n + 1) \).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(n + (k - 2 * n + 1))

import math
func()
```

This program correctly handles the special case for \( k = 1 \) and the general cases for \( k \leq 2n - 1 \) and \( k > 2n - 1 \).
