The only objects in the loop head are the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
