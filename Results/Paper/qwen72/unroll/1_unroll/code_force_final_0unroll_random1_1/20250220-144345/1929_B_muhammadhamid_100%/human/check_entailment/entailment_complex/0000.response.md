### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `k` is 1, the function prints 1 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to have a colored cell, the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The function checks if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`, which simplifies to `2 * (2n - 2) = 4n - 4`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal), so the minimum number of cells required is the ceiling of `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `4n - 4`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is because if `k` exceeds `4n - 4`, it means we need to cover all diagonals, and the minimum number of cells required is `k // 2 + 1` to ensure all diagonals have at least one colored cell.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case as required.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `if k == 1:`
  - This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

- **Condition 2:** `if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):`
  - This condition checks if `k` is within the range where each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals. The formula `2 * (n + (n - 2))` simplifies to `4n - 4`, which is the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by `2n - 2` cells (each cell covering 2 diagonals).
  - The function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which is the correct minimum number of cells needed to cover `k` diagonals when each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

- **Condition 3:** `else:`
  - If `k` exceeds `4n - 4`, it means we need to cover more diagonals than can be covered by `2n - 2` cells. In this case, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`, which ensures that all diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3, k = 4`
  - `4 <= 4 * 3 - 4` (True)
  - `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3, k = 3`
  - `3 <= 4 * 3 - 4` (True)
  - `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3, k = 10`
  - `10 > 4 * 3 - 4` (True)
  - `10 // 2 + 1 = 6` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 3, k = 9`
  - `9 > 4 * 3 - 4` (True)
  - `9 // 2 + 1 = 5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 4, k = 7`
  - `7 <= 4 * 4 - 4` (True)
  - `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:** `n = 7, k = 11`
  - `11 <= 4 * 7 - 4` (True)
  - `math.ceil(11 / 2) = 6` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7:** `n = 2, k = 3`
  - `3 > 4 * 2 - 4` (False)
  - `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (Correct)
