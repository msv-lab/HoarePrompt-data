Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the input parameters are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) in the input description, but this is not reflected in the current function definition.**

To better match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is a revised function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string s has a length of at most 10 and consists of lowercase English letters.**
