Output State: **The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order, it prints the lexicographically largest version). The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated within the loop for each iteration, but their final values depend on the last string `s` processed. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` remains unchanged.**
