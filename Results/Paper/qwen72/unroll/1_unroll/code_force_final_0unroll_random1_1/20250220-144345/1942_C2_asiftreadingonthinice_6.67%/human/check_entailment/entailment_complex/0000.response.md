### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it should be defined with parameters as described in the problem statement: `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`. This is a critical issue since the function needs to accept these inputs to solve the problem.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The chosen vertices `a` are sorted, which is necessary to handle the vertices in a consistent order.

4. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is a reasonable starting point because each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we need to account for the vertices that are already chosen and the additional vertices that can be chosen.

5. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is 2, it increments `ans` by 1, as this gap can form a triangle with the two vertices.
   - If the gap is even and `y` is greater than the number of additional vertices needed to fill the gap, it appends the gap size to `tmp`, increments `ans` by the gap size, and decrements `y` by the number of additional vertices used.

6. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex**:
   - The function checks the gap between the last and first vertex in the sorted list.
   - It applies the same logic as for the other gaps, but there is a mistake in the condition: `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` should be `y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1`.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - The function adds the remaining value of `y` to `ans`.
   - It prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, which is correct because the maximum number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The function has a logical error in the condition for handling the gap between the last and first vertex.
- The function definition is incorrect as it does not accept parameters.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the issues, the function should be defined with parameters and the condition for handling the gap between the last and first vertex should be corrected. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    for ii in range(t):
        n, x, y = n, x, y
        a = chosen_vertices[ii]
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = x + y - 2
        
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))

# Example usage:
t = 3
test_cases = [
    (8, 4, 2, [1, 6, 2, 5]),
    (7, 3, 1, [6, 4, 3]),
    (4, 2, 2, [1, 3])
]
max_triangular_pieces(t, [n for n, x, y, a in test_cases], [x for n, x, y, a in test_cases], [y for n, x, y, a in test_cases], [a for n, x, y, a in test_cases])
```

This corrected version should work as intended for the problem.
