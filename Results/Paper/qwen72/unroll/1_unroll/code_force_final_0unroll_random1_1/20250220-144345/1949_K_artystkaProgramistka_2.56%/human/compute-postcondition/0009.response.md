The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`. `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are also positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns one of two cases:
- Case_1: If the function can successfully divide the sorted list `numbers` (in descending order) into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`), it returns 'YES' along with these three lists. `group_a` contains the first `na` elements, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements.
- Case_2: If the function cannot perform the division as specified, it returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the sorted list `numbers` (in descending order) can be divided into the specified groups. If the division is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
