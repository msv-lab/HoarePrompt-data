Postcondition: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain the same. `numbers` is still a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the first `na`, next `nb`, and last `nc` elements of `numbers`, respectively. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.**
