Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is '12' correctly. According to the problem description, '12:00' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 PM' in 12-hour format, but the program will output '12:00 AM'. This is because the condition `elif int(h) <= 12:` does not distinguish between '12' AM and '12' PM. The correct condition should be `elif int(h) < 12:` to handle '12' PM correctly.
