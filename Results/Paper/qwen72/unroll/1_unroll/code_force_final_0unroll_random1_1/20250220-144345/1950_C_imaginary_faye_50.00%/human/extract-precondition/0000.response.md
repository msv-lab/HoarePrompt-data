Precondition: **The function `func_1` should take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), with `hh` ranging from 00 to 23 and `mm` ranging from 00 to 59. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), which is not included in the function definition provided.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def convert_time(s):
```

This would better reflect the problem's requirements. If you need to handle multiple test cases, you might want to wrap this function in another function that reads `t` and calls `convert_time` for each test case.
