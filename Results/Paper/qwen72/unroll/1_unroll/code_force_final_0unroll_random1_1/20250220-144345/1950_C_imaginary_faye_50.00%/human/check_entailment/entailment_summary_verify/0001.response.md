### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minute part `s[2:]` is directly used as it remains the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

3. **Converting Hours**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it is converted to '12' and printed.
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to '12', it is printed as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than '12', it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h` and then formatting it with a leading zero if necessary using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - The function uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and the condition `int(h) >= 12` to determine whether to print 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, it prints 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'AM'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the converted hour, the minute part, and the AM/PM indicator for each test case.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (00:00)**: The function correctly converts '00:00' to '12:00 AM'.
- **Noon (12:00)**: The function correctly converts '12:00' to '12:00 PM'.
- **Hour 13 and above**: The function correctly converts hours from 13 to 23 by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero if necessary.

### Potential Issues:
- **Leading Zero for Single-Digit Hours**:
  - The function uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` to format the hour when it is greater than 12. This will correctly add a leading zero for single-digit hours (e.g., '13:00' becomes '01:00 PM').
  - However, for hours 13 to 23, the hour part should always be a two-digit number. The function correctly handles this by using the `format` method to add a leading zero if necessary.

- **Hour 00 to 11**:
  - For hours from '00' to '11', the function correctly prints the hour as is and appends 'AM'.
  - For the hour '12', the function correctly prints '12' and appends 'PM'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and follows the logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
