### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minute part `s[2:]` is directly used as it remains the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

3. **Converting Hours**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it is converted to '12' and printed.
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to '12', it is printed as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than '12', it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h` and then formatting it with a leading zero if necessary using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - The function uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and the condition `int(h) >= 12` to determine whether to print 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, it prints 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'AM'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the converted hour, the minute part, and the AM/PM indicator for each test case.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (00:00)**: The function correctly converts '00:00' to '12:00 AM'.
- **Noon (12:00)**: The function correctly converts '12:00' to '12:00 PM'.
- **Hour 13 and above**: The function correctly converts hours from 13 to 23 by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero if necessary.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and edge cases.
- The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- The function prints the correct output for all test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and follows the logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format as described in the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
