#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), with `hh` ranging from 00 to 23 and `mm` ranging from 00 to 59. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), which is not included in the function definition provided.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The function `func_1` will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases. The variables `t` and `s` will be unchanged, but the output will reflect the converted times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). It converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input times have been converted and printed, but the original input variables are not modified.
