Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly handle the case where the smallest pile is not 1 but all other piles have a difference of 1 between consecutive elements. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
2 3 4
```

The correct output should be "Bob" because Alice can only remove 2 stones from each pile, leaving Bob with piles of 0, 1, and 2 stones. Bob can then remove 1 stone from each non-empty pile, leaving Alice with no valid move. However, the program incorrectly returns "Alice" for this case. This indicates that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly handle all edge cases.
