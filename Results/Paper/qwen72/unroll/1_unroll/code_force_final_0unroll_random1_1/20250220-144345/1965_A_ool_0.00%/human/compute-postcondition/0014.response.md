Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It returns 'Alice' if the first element of `arr` is not 1, or if the unique elements in `arr` are consecutive integers starting from 1. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'. **
