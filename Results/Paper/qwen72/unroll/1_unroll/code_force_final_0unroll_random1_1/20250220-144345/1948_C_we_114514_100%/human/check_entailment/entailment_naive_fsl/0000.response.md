Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function only checks if the robot can move to the right in the first half of the grid and whether it can move to the right at the last position. However, it does not consider the full range of movements the robot can make, including moving up and down, and it does not account for the possibility that the robot might need to move back and forth between rows to reach the target cell.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
>>>>
<<<>
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and can move right to (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4). Then, the arrow at (1, 4) points right, so the robot moves to (2, 4). The arrow at (2, 4) points left, so the robot moves to (2, 3). The arrow at (2, 3) points left, so the robot moves to (2, 2). The arrow at (2, 2) points left, so the robot moves to (2, 1). The arrow at (2, 1) points right, so the robot moves to (2, 2), and it gets stuck in a loop.

The program will incorrectly return "Yes" for this test case, even though the robot cannot reach (2, 4) without getting stuck in a loop. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
