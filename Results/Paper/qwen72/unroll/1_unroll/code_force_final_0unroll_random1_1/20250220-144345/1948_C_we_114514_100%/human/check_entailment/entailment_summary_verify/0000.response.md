### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The function `func_1` only checks specific conditions for the robot's movement, but it does not account for the full range of movements the robot can make, including moving up and down, and it does not handle the possibility of the robot getting stuck in a loop.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1` and the issues it has:

1. **Checking the First Half of the Grid:**
   ```python
   for i in range(half_n - 1):
       if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
           return 'No'
   ```
   This loop checks if the robot can move to the right in the first half of the grid. Specifically, it checks if the robot is at position (1, 2*i + 1) and the arrow points left, and if either the arrow at (2, 2*i) or (2, 2*i + 2) points left. If this condition is met, the robot cannot move to the right, and the function returns 'No'.

2. **Checking the Last Position:**
   ```python
   if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
       return 'No'
   ```
   This condition checks if the robot is at the last position in the first row (1, n) and the arrow points left, and if the arrow at (2, n-1) also points left. If this condition is met, the robot cannot move to the right, and the function returns 'No'.

3. **Returning 'Yes':**
   If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

The original assessment provides a test case where the robot gets stuck in a loop:
```
4
>>>>
<<<>
```
In this case:
- The robot starts at (1, 1) and moves to (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4).
- At (1, 4), the arrow points right, so the robot moves to (2, 4).
- At (2, 4), the arrow points left, so the robot moves to (2, 3).
- At (2, 3), the arrow points left, so the robot moves to (2, 2).
- At (2, 2), the arrow points left, so the robot moves to (2, 1).
- At (2, 1), the arrow points right, so the robot moves back to (2, 2).
- The robot gets stuck in a loop between (2, 1) and (2, 2).

The function `func_1` does not account for this loop, and it will incorrectly return 'Yes' for this test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases, including the possibility of the robot getting stuck in a loop. The logic in `func_1` is too limited and does not consider the full range of movements the robot can make. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
