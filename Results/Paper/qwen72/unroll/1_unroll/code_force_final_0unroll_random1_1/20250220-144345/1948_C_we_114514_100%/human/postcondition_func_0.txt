The function `func_1` takes an even integer `n` within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if a robot can move from position (1,1) to position (2,n) based on the given rows. The function returns 'No' if at any point during the check, the robot is blocked from moving to the next position by '<' characters in `row1` and `row2`. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `row1`, or `row2`.
