Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `x` of integers. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged after the function executes. **
