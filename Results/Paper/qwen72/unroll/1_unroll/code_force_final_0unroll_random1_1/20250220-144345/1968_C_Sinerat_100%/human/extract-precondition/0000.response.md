Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list `x` of integers where `1 <= x_i <= 500` and an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `len(x) == n - 1`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def find_array(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `x`.
