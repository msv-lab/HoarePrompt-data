Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input values of \( x \) are such that the constructed array \( a \) does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Specifically, the program initializes \( a_1 \) to 1000 and constructs subsequent elements of \( a \) as \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \). This approach fails when \( x_i \) is greater than \( a_{i-1} \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1002 1006 1007
```
However, this output does not satisfy the condition \( x_3 = a_3 \mod a_2 \):
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1006 \mod 1002 = 4 \neq 1 \).

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
