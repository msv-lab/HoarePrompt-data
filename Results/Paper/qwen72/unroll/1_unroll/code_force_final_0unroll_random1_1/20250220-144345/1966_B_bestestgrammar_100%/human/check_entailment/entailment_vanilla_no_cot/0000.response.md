Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. The logic to determine if the grid can be made uniform is flawed. Specifically, the program checks only the corners and the edges of the grid to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. However, this approach fails to consider the internal structure of the grid and how operations can affect it.

The correct approach should be to check if there is at least one white and one black square in the grid. If the grid contains both colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid one color because any operation can only change the color of squares to match the color of the selected squares, and you cannot change a square to a color that it is not already. If the grid is entirely one color, or if it can be made uniform by the operations (which is possible if there is a path of the same color connecting any two squares of the same color), then the answer should be "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        # Check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid
        has_white = any('W' in row for row in gr)
        has_black = any('B' in row for row in gr)
        
        if has_white and has_black:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

This version checks if the grid contains both 'W' and 'B'. If it does, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid one color. If the grid contains only one color, it prints "YES". This logic is based on the observation that if the grid contains both colors, no sequence of operations can make all squares the same color, as operations can only expand regions of the same color.
