The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the colors of the grid. The constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of elements in all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns a value based on the input grid, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.
