### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - The operations allow us to select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the grid is already all one color, the answer is "YES".
   - If the grid has a mix of colors, we need to check if it is possible to make all squares the same color.
   - The operations can only affect squares that are within the subrectangle defined by the selected squares. Therefore, if there is a single square that is different from the rest, it will be impossible to make all squares the same color.

3. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the answer as "YES".
   - It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors.
   - If they are different, it further checks if all squares in the first row and the last row are the same color, and if all squares in the first column and the last column are the same color.
   - If any of these checks fail, it sets the answer to "NO".

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color unless all squares in the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, are the same color.
   - However, the program does not check if the entire grid can be made the same color if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color. This is a critical oversight because even if the corners are the same, the grid might still have a mix of colors that cannot be unified.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first example, the grid is:
     ```
     W
     B
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
   - For the second example, the grid is:
     ```
     WWWWBW
     WBWWWW
     BBBWWW
     BWWWBB
     WWBWBB
     BBBWBW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the third example, the grid is:
     ```
     W
     ```
     The grid is already all one color, and the program correctly outputs "YES".
   - For the fourth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     ```
     The grid is already all one color, and the program correctly outputs "YES".
   - For the fifth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BWBW
     WBWB
     BWBW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the sixth example, the grid is:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     WW
     WW
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
   - For the seventh example, the grid is:
     ```
     WWBW
     BBWB
     WWBB
     BBBB
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not check the entire grid.
   - For the eighth example, the grid is:
     ```
     WBBWB
     ```
     The top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully check if the entire grid can be made the same color. It only checks the corners and the first and last rows/columns, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness for all cases.

Final: **False**
