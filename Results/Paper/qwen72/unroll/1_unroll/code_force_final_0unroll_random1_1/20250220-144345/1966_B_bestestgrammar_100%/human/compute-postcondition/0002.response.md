Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `m` from input, followed by `n` lines of strings each of length `m`. After processing, it will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible` will be reset for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged, and the list `gr` will be empty.**
