### Reasoning:

The provided program does not actually solve the given problem. Let's break down the requirements and the functions provided to understand why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Vasya has an array `a` and wants to add a permutation `p` to it to maximize the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the same number.
   - The permutation `p` must be of length `n` and contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Input/Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has an integer `n` followed by `n` integers in the array `a`.
   - The output should be the maximum number of elements in `a` that can be made equal after adding a permutation `p`.

3. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a list of integers from input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a list of integers from input and returns it as a list.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a list of integers from input, converts it to a list, and sorts it.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a list of strings from input.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a string from input and returns it as a list of characters.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a list of strings from input, converts it to a list, and sorts it.
   - `func_8(arr)`: Computes the cumulative product of elements in `arr` and returns it as a list.
   - `func_9(arr)`: Computes the cumulative product of elements in `arr` in reverse order and returns it as a list.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in the array `a` that can be made equal after adding a permutation `p`.
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations related to adding a permutation to the array or counting the maximum number of equal elements.
   - Functions `func_8` and `func_9` compute cumulative products, which are not relevant to the problem.
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` are input-handling functions, but they do not solve the problem.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to:
     - Read the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, read the length `n` and the array `a`.
     - Determine the optimal permutation `p` to add to `a` to maximize the number of equal elements.
     - Count the maximum number of equal elements after adding the permutation.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to add a permutation to the array and count the maximum number of equal elements. The functions provided are either for input handling or for unrelated operations (cumulative products). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
