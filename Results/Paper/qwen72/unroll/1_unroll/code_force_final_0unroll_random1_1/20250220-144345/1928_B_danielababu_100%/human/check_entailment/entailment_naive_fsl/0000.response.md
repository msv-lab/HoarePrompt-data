Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` to `func_7` are input handling functions, and `func_8` and `func_9` are for calculating the product of elements in an array, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

The problem requires a function that:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determines the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array.

The provided code does not contain any logic to perform these steps, and thus it does not solve the problem correctly for any input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
