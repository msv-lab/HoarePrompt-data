### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It reads the array `arr` using `func_3()`, which returns a list of integers.

2. **Processing**:
   - The array `arr` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted.
   - The maximum value in the sorted array `m` is calculated, but it is not used in the subsequent logic.
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

3. **Loop and Binary Search**:
   - The program iterates over each element in the sorted array `arr`.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the position `a` where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted to keep the array sorted.
   - The difference `d = a - i` is calculated, which represents the number of elements in the array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - The program updates `ans` with the maximum value of `d`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, the program prints `ans` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Use of `max(arr)`**: The variable `m` is calculated but not used in the logic. This is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Logic for `bisect_left`**: The use of `bisect_left` to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted is correct, but the logic to calculate `d` and update `ans` needs to be carefully examined.

### Correctness Check:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 2]`
  - Sorted unique `arr` is `[1, 2]`.
  - For `arr[0] = 1`, `bisect_left(arr, 1 + 2) = 2`, `d = 2 - 0 = 2`.
  - For `arr[1] = 2`, `bisect_left(arr, 2 + 2) = 2`, `d = 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - `ans` is `2`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `arr = [7, 1, 4, 1]`
  - Sorted unique `arr` is `[1, 4, 7]`.
  - For `arr[0] = 1`, `bisect_left(arr, 1 + 4) = 3`, `d = 3 - 0 = 3`.
  - For `arr[1] = 4`, `bisect_left(arr, 4 + 4) = 3`, `d = 3 - 1 = 2`.
  - For `arr[2] = 7`, `bisect_left(arr, 7 + 4) = 3`, `d = 3 - 2 = 1`.
  - `ans` is `3`, but the correct answer is `2` (as shown in the example).

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum number of elements that can be made equal. Specifically, the use of `bisect_left` and the calculation of `d` does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem. The program should consider the maximum frequency of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation, which is not accurately reflected in the current logic.
