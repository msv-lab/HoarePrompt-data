Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The code snippet provided is a `return` statement without any value or variable specified. This means that the function ends and does not return any specific value. The new values of `n` and `k` are updated by `func_2()`, but since they are not included in the return statement, they are not part of the output. The initial state indicates that `n` was 0, and it is updated to an unknown value, but this update does not affect the return statement.
