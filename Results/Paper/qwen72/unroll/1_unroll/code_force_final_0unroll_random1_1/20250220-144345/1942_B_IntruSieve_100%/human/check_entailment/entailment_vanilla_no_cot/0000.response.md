Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the problem description. The logic for calculating the MEX and using it to determine the elements of `p` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, and it does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_mex(used):
    mex = 0
    while mex in used:
        mex += 1
    return mex

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    used = set()
    mex = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p.append(mex)
            used.add(mex)
            mex = find_mex(used)
        else:
            p.append(mex - arr[i])
            used.add(mex - arr[i])
            mex = find_mex(used)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The `find_mex` function is used to find the minimum non-negative integer that is not in the `used` set.
2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - If `arr[i]` is non-negative, it means `p[i]` should be the current MEX.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it means `p[i]` should be `mex - arr[i]` to satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
3. **Update Used Set**: After determining `p[i]`, it is added to the `used` set, and the MEX is recalculated.

This corrected program ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly and satisfies the given conditions.
