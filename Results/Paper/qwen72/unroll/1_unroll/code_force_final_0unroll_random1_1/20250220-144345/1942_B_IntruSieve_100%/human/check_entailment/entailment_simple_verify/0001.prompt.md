You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each given `a`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: `mex` is a list of integers representing the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values computed for each element in `arr`. `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `used`. `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been used in the MEX computation.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each integer in the `mex` list separated by a space. The values of `mex`, `minn`, and `used` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`.

2. **Understanding the MEX Function:**
   - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For example, MEX([0, 1, 4]) is 2 because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

3. **Reconstructing the Permutation:**
   - We need to determine `p[i]` for each `i` based on the given `a[i]`.
   - The key observation is that `p[i]` can be derived from `a[i]` and the current MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]`.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the reconstructed permutation.
   - It also initializes `minn` to 0, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the numbers that have already been used in the permutation.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means `p[i]` is the current MEX, which is `minn`. The program adds `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The program adds this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used.
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the reconstructed permutation.

6. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for `arr[i] > 0` is correct because it means `p[i]` is the current MEX, which is `minn`.
   - The logic for `arr[i] <= 0` is also correct because it means `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is derived from the given relationship `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `arr[i]` can be negative or positive.
   - The program ensures that the MEX is correctly updated and that no number is used more than once.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The logic and steps are sound, and the program should produce a valid permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
