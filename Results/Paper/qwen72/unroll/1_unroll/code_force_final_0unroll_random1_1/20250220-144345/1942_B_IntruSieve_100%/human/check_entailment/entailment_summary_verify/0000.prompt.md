You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from the user. It computes the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values for each element in `arr` and stores these values in a list `mex`. The MEX value for each element is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the MEX computation so far. The function then prints each MEX value in the `mex` list, separated by a space, followed by an empty line. The function does not return any value; it only performs I/O operations and modifies local variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the logic for determining the value of `mex` and updating the `used` set is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 3
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the expected permutation `p` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. However, the program incorrectly sets the last element of `mex` to `3` instead of `4`. This is because the logic for updating `minn` and `used` does not correctly account for the case where `arr[i]` is positive and the MEX value should be updated accordingly.

The correct approach should involve maintaining a set of used elements and correctly calculating the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation. The provided program fails to do this accurately, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
