The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4. `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle, with the constraint 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the area of the rectangle for each test case. If there are multiple test cases, the function returns a list of areas corresponding to each set of dimensions provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4), and `a` and `b` are the dimensions of a rectangle (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns the area of the rectangle. If there are multiple test cases, it returns a list of areas.**
