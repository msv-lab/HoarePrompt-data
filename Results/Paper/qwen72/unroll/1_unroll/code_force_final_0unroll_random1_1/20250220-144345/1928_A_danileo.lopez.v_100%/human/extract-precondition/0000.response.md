Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
