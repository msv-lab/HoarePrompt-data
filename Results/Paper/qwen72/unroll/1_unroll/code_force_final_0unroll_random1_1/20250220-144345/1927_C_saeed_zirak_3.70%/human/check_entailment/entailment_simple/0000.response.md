### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `aOnes` and `bOnes` to 0, which will be used to count the number of elements chosen from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It also calculates `newk` as `k // 2`, which is the number of elements to be chosen from each array.

3. **Element Selection Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - For each number `i`:
     - If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, it increments the counter of the array with fewer chosen elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
     - If `i` is present only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
     - If `i` is present only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
     - If `i` is not present in either array or the respective counter (`aOnes` or `bOnes`) exceeds `newk`, the loop breaks.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Breaking the Loop Early:**
  - The program breaks the loop as soon as it encounters a number `i` that cannot be chosen from either array. This is correct because if any number from 1 to `k` is missing, it is impossible to choose the required elements.
- **Counter Increment Logic:**
  - The logic for incrementing `aOnes` and `bOnes` is correct. It ensures that the chosen elements are balanced between the two arrays.
- **Output Case Sensitivity:**
  - The output should be case-insensitive, but the program prints 'yes' and 'no' in lowercase. This is acceptable according to the problem statement, which allows any case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements. The program handles the input and output as specified and follows the correct logic for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
