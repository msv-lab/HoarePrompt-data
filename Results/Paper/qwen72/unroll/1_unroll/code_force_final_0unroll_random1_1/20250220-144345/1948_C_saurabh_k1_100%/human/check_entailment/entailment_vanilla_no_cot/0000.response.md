Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The conditions in the `if` statement are not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions**:
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` checks if the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i + 1` both point left. However, this does not necessarily mean the robot cannot reach the target cell.
   - Similarly, the condition `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks if the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i - 1` both point left. This also does not guarantee that the robot cannot reach the target cell.

2. **Missing Key Logic**:
   - The robot needs to be able to move from the first row to the second row and then from the second row to the target cell (2, n). The program does not check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving to the right.
   - The program should check if there is a way for the robot to move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving to the right without getting stuck in a loop or a dead end.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The robot can move from the first row to the second row if there is a cell in the first row that points down (which is not possible in this problem since arrows only point left or right).
   - The robot can move from the second row to the first row if there is a cell in the second row that points up (which is also not possible in this problem).
   - The robot needs to be able to move to the right in both rows without getting stuck in a loop or a dead end.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can reach the target cell
        can_reach = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '>' and b[i] == '>':
                can_reach = True
                break
        
        if can_reach:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The program iterates through each column to check if there is a column where both arrows in the first and second rows point to the right.
- If such a column exists, the robot can move to the right in both rows and eventually reach the target cell (2, n).
- If no such column exists, the robot will get stuck and cannot reach the target cell.

This corrected program should correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.
