Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) on a grid with arrows pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must follow the rules of moving left, right, up, or down, and then moving according to the arrow in the current cell.

The program's logic is based on the observation that for the robot to reach (2, n), it must be able to move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving right until it reaches the last column. The key to this is ensuring that there are no "dead ends" or "traps" created by the arrows in the grid that would prevent the robot from moving to the right and eventually reaching the target cell.

The program checks for a specific condition that would create a trap: if there is an odd index `i` such that the arrows at positions `i` and `i+1` in the two rows point to each other. Specifically, it checks:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', which means the robot would be stuck moving left and right between these two cells.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', which means the robot would be stuck moving left and right between these two cells.

If such a condition is found, the program prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such condition is found, the program prints 'Yes'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. The program prints 'No' and 'Yes' in lowercase, but the problem statement specifies that the output can be in any case (e.g., 'YES', 'Yes', 'yeS'). This is a minor issue, but it should be fixed to match the problem statement.
2. The program's logic is incorrect. It only checks for traps at odd indices, but the robot can move to any cell, and the arrows can create traps at even indices as well. For example, if `a[0]` and `b[1]` are both '<', the robot would be stuck at the beginning.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check for any index `i` (not just odd indices) where the arrows at `a[i]` and `b[i]` point to each other, creating a trap. Additionally, the program should ensure that there is a way for the robot to move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving right until it reaches the last column.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
