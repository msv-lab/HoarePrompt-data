Functionality: ** The function reads `t` test cases from the input, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' or '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in `a` and `b` do not form a pair of arrows pointing to each other. If such a pair is found, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function consumes the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and no longer retains them. **
