You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (each integer n in the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and a list of pairs of strings (each string consists of exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`. After processing, it will print 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it will print 'Yes'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be consumed and no longer available after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads `t` test cases from the input, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' or '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in `a` and `b` do not form a pair of arrows pointing to each other. If such a pair is found, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function consumes the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and no longer retains them.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the movement of the robot in the correct sequence and does not account for the robot's ability to move along the arrows after its initial move. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
yes
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and the grid is as follows:
```
1: ><><
2: ><><
```

The robot's movements would be:
1. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (initial move right).
2. From (1, 2) to (1, 1) (move along the arrow pointing left).
3. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (initial move right again).
4. From (1, 2) to (1, 1) (move along the arrow pointing left again).

The robot is stuck in a loop between (1, 1) and (1, 2) and cannot reach (2, 4). Therefore, the program incorrectly prints "yes" instead of "NO".
