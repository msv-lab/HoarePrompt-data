The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. According to the given state, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and is automatically incremented, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be at least 1**
