You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, the loop reads `n` and `k` from input, processes them, and prints the calculated value based on the conditions provided. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified and retain their initial values for each test case. The list `L` and variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It processes these values and prints a calculated result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified and retain their initial values for each test case. The list `L` and variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input values for `n` and `k` are such that the card laid down is not correctly identified. Specifically, the program incorrectly appends the number of remaining cards to the list `L` and then uses this list to determine the k-th card. This approach does not follow the problem description's requirement of laying down cards in specific groups (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.) and then identifying the k-th card.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 5
```
The correct order of laying down the cards should be:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 10, 4, 8

The 5th card in this order is 9. However, the program will output 2, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of how the program calculates the number of cards to be laid down in each group and how it determines the k-th card. The program should correctly identify the groups and the order in which the cards are laid down, but it fails to do so accurately.
