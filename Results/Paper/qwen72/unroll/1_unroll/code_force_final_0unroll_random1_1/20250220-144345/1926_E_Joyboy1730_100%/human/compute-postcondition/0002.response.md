Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, the loop reads `n` and `k` from input, processes them, and prints the calculated value based on the conditions provided. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified and retain their initial values for each test case. The list `L` and variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each iteration.**
