### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - For each step, he lays down the smallest possible cards that fit the criteria.
   - The task is to determine the k-th card laid down.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The while loop continues until `n` is zero:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current step.
     - `n` is reduced by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
     - `m` is appended to the list `L`.
   - `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - `pow` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the current multiplier (1 for odd, 2 for twice an odd, etc.).
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L`:
     - If `k` is within the range of cards laid down in the current step (`tot < k and k <= tot + a`), it prints the k-th card.
     - `tot` is updated to include the number of cards laid down in the current step.
     - `pow` is doubled to move to the next step.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Step Calculation:**
     - The while loop correctly calculates the number of cards laid down in each step. For example, if `n` is 7, the steps are:
       - Step 1: \( m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4 \) (cards 1, 3, 5, 7)
       - Step 2: \( n = 7 - 4 = 3 \), \( m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2 \) (cards 2, 6)
       - Step 3: \( n = 3 - 2 = 1 \), \( m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 \) (card 4)
       - Step 4: \( n = 1 - 1 = 0 \) (no more cards)
     - The list `L` will be `[4, 2, 1]` for `n = 7`.
   - **Card Identification:**
     - The for loop correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
     - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card in the current step. For example:
       - For `k = 1`, `tot = 0`, `a = 4`, the card is \( 1 * (2 * (1 - 0) - 1) = 1 \).
       - For `k = 2`, `tot = 0`, `a = 4`, the card is \( 1 * (2 * (2 - 0) - 1) = 3 \).
       - For `k = 5`, `tot = 4`, `a = 2`, the card is \( 2 * (2 * (5 - 4) - 1) = 2 \).
       - For `k = 7`, `tot = 6`, `a = 1`, the card is \( 4 * (2 * (7 - 6) - 1) = 4 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly. For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output is 1.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly, as shown in the last test case of the example (`n = 1000000000`, `k = 1000000000`).

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to \(5 \cdot 10^4\) test cases and \(n \leq 10^9\)). The while loop runs in \(O(\log n)\) time, and the for loop runs in \(O(\log n)\) time as well, making the overall complexity \(O(t \log n)\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the given test cases and constraints appropriately.
