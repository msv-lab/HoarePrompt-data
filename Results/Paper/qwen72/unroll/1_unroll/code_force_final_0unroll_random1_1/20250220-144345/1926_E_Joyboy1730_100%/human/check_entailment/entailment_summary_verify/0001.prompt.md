You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It processes these values and prints a calculated result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified and retain their initial values for each test case. The list `L` and variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - For each step, he lays down the smallest possible cards that fit the criteria.
   - The task is to determine the k-th card laid down.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The while loop continues until `n` is zero:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current step.
     - `n` is reduced by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
     - `m` is appended to the list `L`.
   - `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - `pow` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the current multiplier (1 for odd, 2 for twice an odd, etc.).
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L`:
     - If `k` is within the range of cards laid down in the current step (`tot < k and k <= tot + a`), it prints the k-th card.
     - `tot` is updated to include the number of cards laid down in the current step.
     - `pow` is doubled to move to the next step.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card in the current step.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly, as shown in the last test case of the example.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to \(5 \cdot 10^4\) test cases and \(n \leq 10^9\)).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the given test cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
