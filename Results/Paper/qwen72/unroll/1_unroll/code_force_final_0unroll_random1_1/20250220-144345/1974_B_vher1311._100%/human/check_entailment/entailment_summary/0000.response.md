Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves creating a sorted string of unique characters from the original string and then replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart in this sorted string. To decode, the program must reverse this process.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input by iterating over the number of test cases and extracting the length and the encoded string for each case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique and Sorted Characters**: The function `func_1` first creates a string `r` containing all unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - **Mapping Creation**: It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then 'a' maps to 'c', 'b' maps to 'b', and 'c' maps to 'a'.
   - **Decoding**: The function uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character, effectively reversing the encoding process.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them, each on a new line.

**Verification**:
- The program correctly handles the input format, including multiple test cases.
- The decoding logic is implemented correctly by creating a sorted string of unique characters and then mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.
- The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` performs the decoding as intended, transforming the encoded string back to the original string.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly decode the strings as required.

Correctness: **True**
