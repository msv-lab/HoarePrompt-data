Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string based on the described algorithm. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function**:
   - The function `func_1(encoded)` is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It first creates a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string `encoded` to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them all at once, separated by newlines.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
