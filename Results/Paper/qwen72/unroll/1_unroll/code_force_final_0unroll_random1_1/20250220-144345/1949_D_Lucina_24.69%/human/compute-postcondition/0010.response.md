Postcondition: **The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows and columns where there are 'F' (funny) transitions but no 'S' (scary) transitions. The list `sb` will contain the indices of rows and columns where there are 'S' (scary) transitions but no 'F' (funny) transitions. The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, and the variable `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
