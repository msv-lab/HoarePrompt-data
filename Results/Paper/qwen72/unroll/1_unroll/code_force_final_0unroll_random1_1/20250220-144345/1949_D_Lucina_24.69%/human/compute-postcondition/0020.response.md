Output State: **The list `sa` remains unchanged. The list `sb` remains unchanged. The lists `a`, `b`, and `xx`, and the variable `n` remain unchanged. The loop prints a series of strings `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each string `nx` is constructed by iterating through the columns `j` from 1 to `n`. If the element `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
