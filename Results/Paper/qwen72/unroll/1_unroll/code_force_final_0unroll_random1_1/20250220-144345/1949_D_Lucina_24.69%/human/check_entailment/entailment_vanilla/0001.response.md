### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which represents the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions**:
   - The program iterates through each row of the input matrix.
   - For each character in the row, it increments the corresponding counts in `a` and `b` if the character is 'F' or 'S', respectively.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only One Type of Transition**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through each scenario and appends it to `sa` if it has only funny transitions and to `sb` if it has only scary transitions.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`), the program assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'S' to the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Outputting the Full Transition Plan**:
   - The program constructs the full transition plan by iterating through each row of the input matrix.
   - For each character in the row, if it is not '?', it is left unchanged.
   - If it is '?', it is replaced with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions determined in the previous step.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by reading and writing the matrix in a consistent manner. This is important because the transition from scenario `i` to `j` should be the same as from `j` to `i`.

- **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
  - The program attempts to balance the number of funny and scary transitions by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions in a way that respects the constraints.
  - However, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not optimal. It only considers the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` and assigns the opposite type to the rest. This approach does not guarantee that no permutation of scenarios will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - The program does not explicitly check if the resulting transition plan satisfies the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
  - The constraint is crucial, and the program's current logic does not ensure it is met for all possible permutations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the resulting transition plan will satisfy the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
