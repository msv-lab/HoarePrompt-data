The function `func` accepts a list of strings, where each string represents a row in a transition video plan. The list contains `n` strings, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each string is of length `n` and contains characters 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (the diagonal, representing no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transitions are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a string indicating the type of the transition video plan. If the plan is valid (i.e., it meets the constraints and is symmetric), the function returns "Valid". If the plan is invalid, the function returns "Invalid".

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a transition video plan. It returns "Valid" if the plan is valid according to the given constraints, and "Invalid" otherwise.**
