Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no permutation of scenarios should have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type consecutively. The logic in the program for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions does not guarantee this constraint is met for all permutations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```
The program might output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
F.FSF
FFFF.
```
However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the transition videos are F, F, S, F, which has 3 consecutive 'F' videos. This does not violate the constraint, but the program does not ensure that no permutation will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type. A more thorough approach is needed to ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations.
