Output State: **The list `sa` will now contain the indices of rows and columns where there are 'F' (funny) transitions but no 'S' (scary) transitions, as well as any additional indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sb` will remain unchanged. The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, and the variable `n` will also remain unchanged.**
