Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Code Snippet:
```
results = []
for i in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[i]
    # Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create
    min_problems = 0
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] != 'A':
            min_problems += 1
    results.append(min_problems)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. `results` is initialized as an empty list.
2. A loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
3. In each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `a` are unpacked from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
4. `min_problems` is initialized to 0 for each test case.
5. Another loop runs `m` times, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 5.
6. For each character in the first `m` characters of `a`, if the character is not 'A', `min_problems` is incremented by 1.
7. After the inner loop, `min_problems` is appended to `results`.
8. The outer loop continues until all `t` test cases are processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list of length `t` containing the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.**
