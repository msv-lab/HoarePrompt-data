You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer indicates the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the string `a` to ensure each character appears at least `m` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`).
   - It then calls `func_1` with `t` and `test_cases` as arguments and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G') set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value and subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' to get the index (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', etc.).
   - After calculating the frequency of each difficulty level, it calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level. This is done by taking the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. If `f` is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that difficulty level, and `m - f` gives the number of additional problems needed.
   - The total number of missing problems is the sum of these values.
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq)) = 2` (one 'A' and one 'F' are missing)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 2 - f) for f in freq)) = 5` (one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'E', and one 'F' are missing)
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq)) = 1` (one 'A' is missing)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description. The logic and implementation are sound.
