### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which implies \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - This means \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the number of valid pairs as \(n\) (which is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values by checking how many multiples of \(b\) are within the range \([1, n]\).

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: `ans = n` is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid.
   - **Loop**: The loop starts from `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
     - **Condition Check**: `if g < countmins: break` ensures that if the number of multiples of \(b\) in the range \([1, n]\) is less than \(b - 1\), the loop breaks. This is because \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - **Counting Valid Pairs**: `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` are used to count the valid pairs. However, this part of the code is not straightforward and might be incorrect.
     - **Incrementing Count**: `count += 1` correctly increments \(b\).

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` is not straightforward and might not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs should be more explicit and clear.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), count the number of \(a\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over \(a\) and checking the condition directly.

### Detailed Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - `ans = n` is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid pairs.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop starts from `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
  - **Condition Check**: `if g < countmins: break` ensures that if the number of multiples of \(b\) in the range \([1, n]\) is less than \(b - 1\), the loop breaks. This is a valid condition because it ensures that there are no more valid multiples of \(b\) that can satisfy the condition.
  - **Counting Valid Pairs**: 
    - `g = int(n / count)` calculates the number of multiples of \(b\) within the range \([1, n]\).
    - `g -= countmins` subtracts \(b - 1\) from `g`. This step is intended to adjust the count of valid multiples, but it is not clear why \(b - 1\) is subtracted.
    - `ans += int(g / count) + 1` adds the number of valid multiples of \(b\) to `ans`. This step is also not clear and might be incorrect.

### Correctness of the Code:

- The initialization `ans = n` is correct.
- The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
- However, the logic for counting valid pairs within the loop is not clear and might be incorrect. Specifically, the steps `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` do not clearly follow from the problem's conditions and might not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the potential issues in the logic for counting valid pairs, the provided program is not correct.

Final: **False**
