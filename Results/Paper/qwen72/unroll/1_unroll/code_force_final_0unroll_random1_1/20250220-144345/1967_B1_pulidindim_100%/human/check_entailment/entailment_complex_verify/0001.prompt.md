You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The value of `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed, and `n` and `m` are updated with the last input values read from the user. The variable `ans` is calculated for each iteration and printed, but it does not persist between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the user. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` and prints this value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed, and the last values of `n` and `m` read from the user are retained. The variable `ans` is recalculated and printed for each test case, and it does not persist between test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which implies \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - This means \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the number of valid pairs as \(n\) (which is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values by checking how many multiples of \(b\) are within the range \([1, n]\).

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: `ans = n` is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid.
   - **Loop**: The loop starts from `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
     - **Condition Check**: `if g < countmins: break` ensures that if the number of multiples of \(b\) in the range \([1, n]\) is less than \(b - 1\), the loop breaks. This is because \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - **Counting Valid Pairs**: `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` are used to count the valid pairs. However, this part of the code is not entirely clear and might be incorrect.
     - **Incrementing Count**: `count += 1` correctly increments \(b\).

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += int(g / count) + 1` is not straightforward and might not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs should be more explicit and clear.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), count the number of \(a\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over \(a\) and checking the condition directly.

### Correctness:
Given the potential issues in the logic for counting valid pairs, the provided program is not correct.
