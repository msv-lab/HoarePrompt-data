Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Issues:
1. **Initial Counting of Pairs**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect. This assumes that all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, but it does not account for other pairs correctly.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over `count` starting from 2 up to `m`. However, the way it calculates the number of valid pairs is incorrect.
   - The variable `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, which is not used correctly in the logic.
   - The calculation `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent operations do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). The GCD is crucial for determining if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Pair Iteration**: For each test case, it iterates over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
- **GCD Calculation**: It calculates the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
- **Condition Check**: It checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) using the modulo operation.
- **Counting Valid Pairs**: It increments the count for each valid pair.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.

This corrected program should accurately solve the problem as described.
