Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to update the positions of the Quaffle and the players. However, the `mouvements` dictionary is defined incorrectly. The movements should be:
   - `L` (left): (-1, 0)
   - `R` (right): (1, 0)
   - `U` (up): (0, -1)
   - `D` (down): (0, 1)

   The current definition in the program is:
   - `L` (left): (-1, 0)
   - `R` (right): (1, 0)
   - `U` (up): (0, -1)
   - `D` (down): (0, 1)

   This is correct, but the function `func_1` should be applied correctly to the positions. The function should be called with the correct parameters to update the positions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Catching the Quaffle**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Throwing the Quaffle**: When a player throws the Quaffle, the program should check if the player is at a goal of the other team and update the score accordingly. However, the current implementation only checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score, but it does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

4. **Incorrect Handling of the Quaffle's Position After Scoring**: After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which team scored. The current implementation only resets the Quaffle to the middle if a player scores in their own goal, which is incorrect.

5. **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination**: The program should correctly handle the elimination of players when they are in the same cell as the Bludger. The current implementation checks for the Bludger and eliminates players, but it does not correctly reset the Quaffle's position if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated.

6. **Incorrect Final Score Output**: The final score should be printed as `FINAL SCORE: r b`, but the current implementation prints `FINAL SCORE: pointsr pointsb`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
movements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

def move_entity(entity, direction):
    (x, y) = entity
    (dx, dy) = movements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = move_entity(quidditch[0], mo[1])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = move_entity(players[mo[0]], mo[1])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch[0] = players[c]
                    quidditch[1] = ''
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quidditch[0]:
            quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly based on the problem description.
