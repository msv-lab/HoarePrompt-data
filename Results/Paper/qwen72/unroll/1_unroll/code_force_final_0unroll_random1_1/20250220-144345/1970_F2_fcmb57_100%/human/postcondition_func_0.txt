The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers. However, the function attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which results in an error because `a` and `b` are single integers and not iterable. The function does not return any valid values and will always raise a `ValueError` due to the incorrect unpacking.
