Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_4` incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem specifies that if no suitable permutation exists, the output should be "No", not `(0, 0)`.

Additionally, the logic in `func_1` and `func_3` does not always produce a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The program should output "No" because it is impossible to construct a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and may produce an incorrect permutation.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
4 5
```
Expected Output:
```
No
```
Actual Output:
The program may produce an incorrect permutation or an incorrect "No" output due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
