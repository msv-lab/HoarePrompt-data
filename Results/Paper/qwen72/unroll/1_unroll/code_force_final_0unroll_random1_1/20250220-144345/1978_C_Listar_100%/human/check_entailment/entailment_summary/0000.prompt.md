Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000,000) that is divisible by 2. The function returns a list `l` which initially contains integers from 1 to `n`. The function modifies `l` and `k` through a series of operations. If `k` becomes 0, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1` during the loop, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` and `k` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at the positions `len(l) - c - 1` and `len(l) - c - k - 1` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, which still contains distinct integers of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). After the function concludes, the element at index `len(l) - c - 1` is the original element at index `len(l) - c - k - 1`, and the element at index `len(l) - c - k - 1` is the original element at index `len(l) - c - 1`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l`. It swaps the values at indices `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. The function ensures that the values at these specific indices are exchanged, leaving the rest of the list unchanged.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is even but greater than the maximum possible value `max_k` (which is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even). Otherwise, it returns the input integers `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `k` is even. The function ensures that `max_k` is always greater than or equal to `k` when it returns `n` and `k`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list in the order they appear, separated by spaces. The list `l` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`. The function ultimately does not return any value.
