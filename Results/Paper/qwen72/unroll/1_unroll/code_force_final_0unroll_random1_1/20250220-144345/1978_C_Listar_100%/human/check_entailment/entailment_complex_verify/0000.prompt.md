You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and k is divisible by 2.

    #State: `c` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even, `k` is the result of repeated subtractions, and `l` is the result of repeated calls to `func_3(c, l)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000,000) that is divisible by 2. The function returns a list `l` which initially contains integers from 1 to `n`. The function modifies `l` and `k` through a series of operations. If `k` becomes 0, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1` during the loop, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` and `k` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, l is a list of distinct integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and 0 <= c < len(l), 0 <= k < len(l).

    #The program returns the list `l` of distinct integers of length `n`, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and the element at index `len(l) - c - 1` is `y`, and the element at index `len(l) - c - k - 1` is `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at the positions `len(l) - c - 1` and `len(l) - c - k - 1` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, which still contains distinct integers of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). After the function concludes, the element at index `len(l) - c - 1` is the original element at index `len(l) - c - k - 1`, and the element at index `len(l) - c - k - 1` is the original element at index `len(l) - c - 1`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer, l is a list of integers of length n, where 1 <= c <= n/2.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` where the values at indices `c-1` and `-c` have been swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l`. It swaps the values at indices `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. The function ensures that the values at these specific indices are exchanged, leaving the rest of the list unchanged.

        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2

        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is assigned the value (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is assigned the value of `n`.

    #State: `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is assigned the value (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is assigned the value of `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the integer values of `n` and `k`, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`. In both cases, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is even but greater than the maximum possible value `max_k` (which is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even). Otherwise, it returns the input integers `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `k` is even. The function ensures that `max_k` is always greater than or equal to `k` when it returns `n` and `k`.

    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The list `l` remains unchanged, and the integers in `l` are printed in the order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    return
    #The program returns nothing, but the integers in the list `l` are printed in the order they appear, separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list in the order they appear, separated by spaces. The list `l` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.

#Function 6:

    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. The values of `n` and `k` are now updated to the specific values returned by the function, but the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12 still apply. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`. The function ultimately does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_4` incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem specifies that if no suitable permutation exists, the output should be "No", not `(0, 0)`.

Additionally, the logic in `func_1` and `func_3` does not always produce a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The program should output "No" because it is impossible to construct a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and may produce an incorrect permutation.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
4 5
```
Expected Output:
```
No
```
Actual Output:
The program may produce an incorrect permutation or an incorrect "No" output due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
