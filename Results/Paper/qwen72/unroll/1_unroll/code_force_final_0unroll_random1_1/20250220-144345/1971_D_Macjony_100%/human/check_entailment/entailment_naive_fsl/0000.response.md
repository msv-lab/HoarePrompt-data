Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted but contains only '1's. For example, for the input "11111111", the program will output 8, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, as the string is already sorted and no cuts are needed. 

The issue arises because the program increments the `count` for every transition between characters, even if the string is already sorted. This leads to an incorrect count for strings that are entirely composed of '1's.
