The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided context, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The integer `n` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the array `a` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. There is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

The function returns a result based on the input test cases. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function processes these inputs and returns a result, we can infer the following:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the input test cases, ensuring that the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5 are met.**
