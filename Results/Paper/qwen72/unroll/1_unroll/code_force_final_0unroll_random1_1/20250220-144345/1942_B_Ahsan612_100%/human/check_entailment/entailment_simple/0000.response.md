Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the formula \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Let's break down the logic and check if the program correctly constructs `p`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because initially, all integers from 0 to `n-1` are potential candidates for the MEX, and `n` itself is not in the range of valid MEX values.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **MEX Update**:
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `ar[i]` is a non-negative integer (since `mex - ar[i]` is a valid index in the permutation).
   - Therefore, `mex` is always updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The resulting permutation `res` is printed for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. The MEX of a prefix of the permutation should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in that prefix.
- The current logic assumes that `mex` is always the largest possible value and updates it by subtracting `ar[i]`. This does not ensure that `mex` is the correct MEX for the prefix.

To correctly handle the MEX, we need to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix. This can be done using a set or a similar data structure to efficiently check and update the MEX.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
