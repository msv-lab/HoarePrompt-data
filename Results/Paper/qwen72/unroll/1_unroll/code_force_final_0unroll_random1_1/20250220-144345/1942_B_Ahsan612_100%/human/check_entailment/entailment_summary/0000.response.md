Reasoning:  
The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The solution provided by the program works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Result Array Setup**: It initializes an array `res` of length `n` with `None` values to store the reconstructed permutation.

3. **MEX Calculation and Permutation Reconstruction**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the value of `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output**: After processing all elements of `a`, the program prints the resulting array `res`.

### Analysis:
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a permutation is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the permutation. The program correctly updates `mex` to ensure it reflects the MEX of the current prefix of the permutation.
- **Permutation Reconstruction**: The formula `mex - ar[i]` is used to determine the value of `p_i` based on the given `a_i`. This formula is derived from the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, which can be rearranged to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `a_i` can be negative or positive, and it ensures that the values of `p` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

### Verification:
- **Example 1**: For `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the program correctly reconstructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
  - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
  - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`
- **Example 2**: For `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program correctly reconstructs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`
- **Example 3**: For `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the program correctly reconstructs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.
  - `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2`
  - `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2`

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` for the given examples and adheres to the problem constraints.
