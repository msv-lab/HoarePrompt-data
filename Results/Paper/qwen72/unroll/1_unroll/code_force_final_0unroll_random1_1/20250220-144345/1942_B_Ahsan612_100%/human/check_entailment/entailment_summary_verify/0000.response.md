Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the construction of the permutation `p` from the array `a` correctly in all cases. The key issue lies in the logic for updating the `mex` value. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the current prefix of the permutation, but the program updates `mex` in a way that does not guarantee this property.

Let's break down the specific issues with the program:

1. **Initialization of `mex`**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because initially, all integers from 0 to `n-1` are not in the permutation.

2. **Backward Calculation**: The program iterates over the array `ar` from the last element to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of the permutation.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 -2 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
   - Program Output: `0 1 3 2 4`

   Let's trace the program's execution for this test case:
   - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `mex = 5`
   - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
   - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4` (This is incorrect because `mex` should be 2)
   - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3` (This is incorrect because `mex` should be 2)
   - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2` (This is incorrect because `mex` should be 1)

   The program's output `0 1 3 2 4` does not match the expected output `0 1 4 2 3` because the `mex` value is not correctly updated to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of the permutation.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly construct the permutation `p`, we need to maintain a set of integers that have not yet been used in the permutation.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, we can determine `p[i]` by finding the smallest non-negative integer that, when added to `ar[i]`, gives the current `mex` value.
   - After determining `p[i]`, we should update the set of unused integers and the `mex` value accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` in all cases.

Final: **False**
