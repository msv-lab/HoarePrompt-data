The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that the input variables `a` and `s` are no longer relevant.
