Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

    2
    0
    2

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s`, then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and prints the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `s` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that the input variables `a` and `s` are no longer relevant.
