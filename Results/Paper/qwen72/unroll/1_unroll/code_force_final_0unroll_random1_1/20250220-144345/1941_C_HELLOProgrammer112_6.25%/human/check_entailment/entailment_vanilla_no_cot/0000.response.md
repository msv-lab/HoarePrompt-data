Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and does not account for overlapping occurrences or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to remove any occurrence of "pie" or "map" as substrings, which can be more complex than simply counting the non-overlapping occurrences.

For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count one "map" and one "pie", and output 2. However, the correct answer is also 2, but for a different reason: you can remove the 4th and 9th characters to make the string beautiful, which involves overlapping substrings.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify all possible overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map" and determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove them. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        deletions = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n - 2:
            if s[i:i+3] == "pie":
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == "map":
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This version correctly handles overlapping substrings and calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
