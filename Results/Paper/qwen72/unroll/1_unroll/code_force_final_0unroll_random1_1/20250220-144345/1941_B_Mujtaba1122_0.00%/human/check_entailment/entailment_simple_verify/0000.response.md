Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program provided does not handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the `func_2` function where the while loop is incorrectly modifying the elements of the list.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The operation described is to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Program Code**:
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operation described in the problem, but it uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is incorrect.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls.
   - However, the annotations for `func_2` are misleading. The state after the while loop should not be that `list[0]` to `list[n-2]` are zero, as the operations are not correctly applied.

4. **Flaw in `func_2`**:
   - The while loop in `func_2` is:
     ```python
     while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
         list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
         list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
         list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
   - This loop is intended to perform the operation, but it uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is not what the problem description specifies.
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
         list[i - 1] -= 1
         list[i] -= 2
         list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

5. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input `n = 5` and `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the program will not correctly transform the array to all zeros.
   - The actual output will be `NO` because the incorrect decrement values will not allow the array to be transformed as required.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

Final: **False**
