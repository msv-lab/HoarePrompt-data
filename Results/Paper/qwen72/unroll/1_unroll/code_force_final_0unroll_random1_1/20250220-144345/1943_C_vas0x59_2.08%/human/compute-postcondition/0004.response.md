Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list represents the neighbors of a node in an undirected graph. The length of each list in `u2vs` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, and the total number of elements across all lists is `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is a list representing the shortest distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, and `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value (likely a list of parent nodes or a similar structure) but is not used.**

Explanation:
- The `bfs(0)` function performs a Breadth-First Search starting from node 0.
- The function returns two values: `d` and `_`.
- `d` is assigned the first value returned by `bfs(0)`, which is a list of shortest distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
- The second value returned by `bfs(0)` is assigned to `_`, which is typically used to discard a value that is not needed.
- The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as the BFS function does not modify it.
