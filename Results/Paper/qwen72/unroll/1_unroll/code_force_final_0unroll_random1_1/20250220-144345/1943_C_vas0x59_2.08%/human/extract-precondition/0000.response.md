Precondition: **The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 200) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The function constructs a list of adjacency lists `u2vs` where `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of the vertices adjacent to vertex `i`.**
