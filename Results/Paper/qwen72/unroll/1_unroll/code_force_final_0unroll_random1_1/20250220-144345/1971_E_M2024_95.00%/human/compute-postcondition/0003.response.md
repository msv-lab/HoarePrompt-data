The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters for each test case:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the upper limit of the sequence `a`, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
  - `k`: An integer representing the length of the sequence `a`, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, with the constraint 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5.
  - `a`: A strictly increasing sequence of integers of length `k`, with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_k = n.
  - `b`: A strictly increasing sequence of integers of length `q`, with each element `b_i` such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `d`: A list of integers, each representing a query, with each element such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n.

The function returns a list of results for each query `d` in each test case. The result for each query is determined based on the sequences `a` and `b`, but the specific output for each query is not provided in the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d`. It returns a list of results for each query `d` in each test case, where the results are determined based on the sequences `a` and `b`.**
