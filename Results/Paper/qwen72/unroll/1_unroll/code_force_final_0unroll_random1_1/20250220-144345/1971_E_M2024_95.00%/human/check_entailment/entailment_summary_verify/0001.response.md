### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the positions and the corresponding times of the car at those positions.
   - The program correctly initializes `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the beginning to handle the starting point.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` to get the distances `ad` and the time differences `bd`.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment by dividing the corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.
   - This preprocessing is correct and necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left(a, ql)` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, it prints `b[s]` directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the distance `a[s-1]` from `ql` to get the remaining distance within the segment.
     - Adding the time `b[s-1]` already traveled to the time calculated for the remaining distance using the speed `v[s]`.
   - The time calculation is done using the formula `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, which is correct for the constant speed assumption.

4. **Rounding Down:**
   - The program uses `int(m)` to round down the time to the nearest integer, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `bisect_left` Usage:**
  - `bisect_left(a, ql)` correctly finds the index `s` such that `a[s]` is the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. This is crucial for determining the segment in which `ql` lies.

- **Handling Exact Matches:**
  - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, the program correctly prints `b[s]`.

- **Calculating Time for Non-Exact Matches:**
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining distance within the segment by subtracting `a[s-1]` from `ql`.
  - It then adds the time `b[s-1]` already traveled to the time calculated for the remaining distance using the speed `v[s]`.
  - The time calculation is done using the formula `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, which is correct for the constant speed assumption.

- **Rounding Down:**
  - The program uses `int(m)` to round down the time to the nearest integer, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the input, processes the queries, and outputs the results as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
