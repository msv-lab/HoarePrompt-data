### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting the input strings to integers.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position no greater than `m`.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue (`num_fila - 1`) to the `max_p` position (`max_p - 1`), adding the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost.
   - This part of the loop ensures that Kirill pays the minimum cost to move to a position just before `m`.

3. **Final Position Adjustment**:
   - The program then iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue (`0`), checking if it is cheaper to move to the next position using `b_values[y]` or stay at the current position using `a_values[y]`.
   - If moving to the next position is cheaper, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost and, if at the first position, also adds `a_values[0]` to the cost.
   - If staying at the current position is cheaper, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated cost for each test case to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the costs one by one.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program correctly identifies the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position no greater than `m`.
- The logic for calculating the cost is sound, as it considers both the direct cost to move to a specific position and the cumulative cost to move through intermediate positions.
- The use of `break` in the second loop ensures that the program stops calculating costs once it finds the cheapest way to reach a position no greater than `m`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `m` is equal to `n` (i.e., Kirill is already in the desired position) explicitly. However, the logic should still work correctly in this case because the first loop will not add any costs, and the second loop will not run.
- The program assumes that the input is always valid, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound.
