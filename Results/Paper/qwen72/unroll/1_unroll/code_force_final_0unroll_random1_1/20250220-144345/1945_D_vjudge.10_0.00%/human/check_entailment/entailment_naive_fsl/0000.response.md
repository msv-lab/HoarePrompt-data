Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
1
5 2
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
10
```

### Actual Output:
```
13
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Explanation:**
  - `n = 5`: There are 5 people in the queue.
  - `m = 2`: Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people.
  - `a_values = [7, 3, 6, 9, 2]`: The cost to bribe each person in the queue.
  - `b_values = [4, 3, 8, 5, 1]`: The cost to bribe each person between positions.

- **Expected Solution:**
  - Kirill starts at position 6 (end of the queue).
  - To move to position 2, he can:
    - Move to position 5 (cost = 2 coins).
    - Move to position 4 (cost = 5 coins).
    - Move to position 3 (cost = 8 coins).
    - Move to position 2 (cost = 3 coins).
  - Total cost = 2 + 5 + 3 = 10 coins.

- **Actual Solution:**
  - The program calculates the cost as 13 coins, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to the desired position. Specifically, it does not handle the dynamic nature of the costs and the optimal path for Kirill to move through the queue. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
