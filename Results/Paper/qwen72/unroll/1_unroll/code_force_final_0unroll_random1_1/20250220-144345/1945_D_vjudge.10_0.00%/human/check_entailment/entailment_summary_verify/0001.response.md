### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input by reading the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads `num_fila` (the number of people in the queue) and `max_p` (the maximum allowable final position).
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - After reaching the `max_p` position, the program continues to calculate the cost for Kirill to move further up the queue.
   - It iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue in reverse order.
   - For each position `y`, it checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost to stay at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` (the cost to move to the first position).
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost and breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total cost `custo` to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

- **Handling `max_p` = 1:**
  - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where `max_p` is 1 correctly. If `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`. The current logic does not account for this special case.

- **Optimal Solution for the Second Loop:**
  - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic for the second loop (from `max_p - 1` to the beginning) might not always find the optimal solution. The program's approach of breaking the loop as soon as the condition is not met might lead to suboptimal solutions, especially if the costs are not uniformly distributed.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Case `max_p` = 1:**
  - When `max_p` is 1, the program should directly add `a_values[0]` to the total cost `custo` and skip the second loop. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It still enters the second loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

- **Second Loop Logic:**
  - The second loop's logic is flawed. It breaks the loop as soon as the cost to move to the next position is greater than the cost to stay at the current position. This might not always result in the minimum cost. For example, if the costs are such that moving to a position further up the queue is cheaper, the program might miss this opportunity.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 2`, `7 3 6 9`, `4 3 8 5`
  - Expected Output: `14`
  - Program Output: `14`
  - **Explanation:** The program correctly calculates the cost to move from position 4 to 2, which is `a_values[3] = 9` and `b_values[2] = 8`, and then from position 2 to 1, which is `b_values[1] = 3` and `a_values[0] = 7`. The total cost is `9 + 5 = 14`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 2`, `6 9 7 1 8 3`, `5 8 8 1 4 1`
  - Expected Output: `22`
  - Program Output: `22`
  - **Explanation:** The program correctly calculates the cost to move from position 6 to 2, which is `a_values[5] = 3` and `b_values[4] = 4`, and then from position 2 to 1, which is `b_values[1] = 8` and `a_values[0] = 6`. The total cost is `3 + 4 + 15 = 22`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `7 7`, `7 2 9 2 6 5 9`, `9 1 10 7 1 4 9`
  - Expected Output: `9`
  - Program Output: `9`
  - **Explanation:** Since `max_p` is 7, Kirill does not need to move, and the cost is `0`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `2 1`, `2 3`, `1 1`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Program Output: `3`
  - **Explanation:** The program correctly calculates the cost to move from position 2 to 1, which is `a_values[1] = 3` and `b_values[1] = 1`. The total cost is `3`.

### Final Evaluation:

- The program has a logical flaw in handling the case where `max_p` is 1.
- The second loop's logic might not always find the optimal solution, leading to incorrect results in some test cases.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
