### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input by reading the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - After reaching the `max_p` position, the program continues to calculate the cost for Kirill to move further up the queue.
   - It iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue in reverse order.
   - For each position `y`, it checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost to stay at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` (the cost to move to the first position).
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost and breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total cost `custo` to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

### Analysis:
- The program's logic is designed to minimize the cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The initial cost calculation is correct for positions from `num_fila` to `max_p`.
- The subsequent cost calculation for positions from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue is intended to find the optimal position with the minimum cost, but it has a critical flaw.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling `max_p` = 1:**
  - If `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. It will still attempt to move Kirill to the first position using the second loop, which is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results.
- **Optimal Solution in the Second Loop:**
  - The logic in the second loop might not always find the optimal solution. Specifically, the condition `if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not sufficient to ensure that Kirill moves to the optimal position. This condition only checks the immediate next position, but Kirill might need to consider multiple positions to find the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is mostly correct for the initial cost calculation.
- However, the program has significant issues with handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and might not always find the optimal solution for the second loop, leading to incorrect results in some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has issues with handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and might not always find the optimal solution for the second loop. These issues can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
