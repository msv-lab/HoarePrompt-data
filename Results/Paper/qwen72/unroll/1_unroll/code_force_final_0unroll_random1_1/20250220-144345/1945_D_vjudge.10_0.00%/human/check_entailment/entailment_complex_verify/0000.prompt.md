You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: `custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases. The length of `custos` is equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are not directly modified by the loop, but `a_values` and `b_values` are populated from input for each test case.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The values of `custos` are printed one by one, and the state of `custos` remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are also unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing the costs to bribe individuals. It calculates and prints the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed costs for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, and `b_values` are not directly modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
1
5 2
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
10
```

### Actual Output:
```
13
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Explanation:**
  - `n = 5`: There are 5 people in the queue.
  - `m = 2`: Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people.
  - `a_values = [7, 3, 6, 9, 2]`: The cost to bribe each person in the queue.
  - `b_values = [4, 3, 8, 5, 1]`: The cost to bribe each person between positions.

- **Expected Solution:**
  - Kirill starts at position 6 (end of the queue).
  - To move to position 2, he can:
    - Move to position 5 (cost = 2 coins).
    - Move to position 4 (cost = 5 coins).
    - Move to position 3 (cost = 8 coins).
    - Move to position 2 (cost = 3 coins).
  - Total cost = 2 + 5 + 3 = 10 coins.

- **Actual Solution:**
  - The program calculates the cost as 13 coins, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to the desired position. Specifically, it does not handle the dynamic nature of the costs and the optimal path for Kirill to move through the queue. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
