Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}, which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can ask at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and receives a comparison result "<", ">", or "=" based on the bitwise OR of the selected indices. The function must find and output a pair of indices i and j (0 <= i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, and the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
