The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it implicitly works with a sequence of integers `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, which is a permutation of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can ask at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where `0 <= a, b, c, d < n`, and it receives a comparison result "<", ">", or "=" based on the bitwise OR of the selected indices. The function must find and output a pair of indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 10^3, and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find and output a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, given a sequence of integers `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` which is a permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can ask at most 3n queries to determine the comparison results based on the bitwise OR of selected indices. It handles up to 10^3 test cases with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.**
