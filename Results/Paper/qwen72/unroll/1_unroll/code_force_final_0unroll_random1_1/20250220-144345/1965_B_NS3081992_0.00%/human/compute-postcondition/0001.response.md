Output State: The loop iterates `func_10()` times, and each iteration prints the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline. The final output state is that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the values returned by `func_14()` have been printed to the console, one per line. The state of any other variables not involved in the loop head or body remains unchanged.
