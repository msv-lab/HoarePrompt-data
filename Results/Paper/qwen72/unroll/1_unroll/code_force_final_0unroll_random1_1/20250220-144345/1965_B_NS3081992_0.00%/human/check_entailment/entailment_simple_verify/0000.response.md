### Reasoning:

1. **Function 14 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_14` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
   - The function first checks if `k == 1`. If so, it handles a special case where `n == 2` by returning the sequence `1\n2`. For other values of `n`, it generates a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`, the function generates a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`. Finally, it appends powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 (since all elements are greater than 1) and that all other values from 1 to `n` can be represented as a subsequence sum (since the sequence contains all necessary powers of 2).

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k != 1`, the sequence starts with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, ensuring that all values up to `2^(lk-2) - 1` can be represented as subsequence sums.
   - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to ensure that the sum of the sequence up to this point is `k - 1`, which prevents any subsequence from summing to `k`.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that values greater than `k` can be represented as subsequence sums.
   - Finally, the remaining powers of 2 are added to cover the range from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)`.

4. **Counterexample Evaluation**:
   - For the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence generated by the program is `1 2 4 7 9 17`.
   - The subsequence `[1, 2, 4, 1]` sums to 8, which violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.
   - The sequence also does not contain a subsequence that sums to 7, which is another violation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The program does not always ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, while also ensuring that for all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
