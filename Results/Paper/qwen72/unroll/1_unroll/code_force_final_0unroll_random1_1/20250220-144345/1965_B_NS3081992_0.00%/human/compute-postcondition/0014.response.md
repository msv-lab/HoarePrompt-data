The objects in the loop head are `i`, `lk`. For the loop to execute, `lk - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `lk` must be at least 1. Since `lk` is the length of `bk`, this implies that `bk` must be a non-empty string. Given that `k` is not equal to 1 and `1 <= k <= n`, `bk` will always have a length of at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `lk` is at least 1.

However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `lk` should be at least 2 to ensure that the range `lk - 1` is non-zero.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
