The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element. Otherwise, it updates the `processing` list by temporarily setting certain elements to 1 and then resetting them to 0. The function also updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` plus 1. Finally, the function returns this updated value.
