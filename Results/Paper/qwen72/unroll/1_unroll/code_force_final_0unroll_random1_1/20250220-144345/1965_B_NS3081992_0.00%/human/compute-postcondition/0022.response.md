Output State: **The program returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` contains the values [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]. Otherwise, `ans` contains the values [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(l-1)]. Here, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
