### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()`.

2. **Function `func_3`:**
   - **Base Case (n == 2):** If `n` is 2, the program directly calls `func_2(0, 1)` because the only possible permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and the maximum XOR is always `1` for these cases.
   - **General Case (n > 2):**
     - The program initializes `max_index` to 0.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
     - If `(p_0 | p_max_index) < (p_0 | p_i)`, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This ensures that `max_index` points to the index with the maximum value of `p_i` when combined with `p_0` using the OR operation.
     - After finding `max_index`, it initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` again and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
     - If `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) < (p_max_index | p_i)`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
     - If `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) == (p_max_index | p_i)`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
     - This ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices `i` where `p_i` has the same value when ORed with `p_max_index`.
     - The program then initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
     - It iterates over `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)`.
     - If `(p_min_index | p_min_index) == (p_min_index | p_i)`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
     - This ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to make a query to the interactor.
   - It prints the query in the format `? a b c d` and flushes the output.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns it as a string.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is used to output the final answer.
   - It prints the answer in the format `! a b` and flushes the output.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the base case where `n == 2`.
- For `n > 2`, the program attempts to find the maximum and minimum indices based on the OR operation results.
- The logic for updating `max_index` and `min_indices` is sound, but there is a potential issue in the final loop where `min_index` is updated. The condition `if res == '='` should actually be `if res == '<'` to ensure that `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`.

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct, but there is a logical error in the final loop where `min_index` is updated. The condition should be `if res == '<'` instead of `if res == '='`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
