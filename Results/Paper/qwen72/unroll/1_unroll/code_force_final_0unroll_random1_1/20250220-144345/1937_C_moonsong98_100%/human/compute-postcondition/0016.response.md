Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of `func_1` comparisons. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the maximum index and the minimum index (which is the last index in the list of minimum indices that is not equal to the maximum index, or the first index in the list if all are equal to the maximum index). The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. **
