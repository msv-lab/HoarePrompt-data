You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #The program returns the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are non-negative integers. It prints a query string in the format `? [a] [b] [c] [d]` and then returns the input string provided by the user after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace.

    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers within the range of a permutation `p` (0 to n-1, where n is the length of `p`). It prints the string `! [a] [b]` to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the integer values of `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the standard output will contain the printed string, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of the print operation.

    func_2(max_index, min_index)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of `func_1` comparisons. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the maximum index and the minimum index (which is the last index in the list of minimum indices that is not equal to the maximum index, or the first index in the list if all are equal to the maximum index). The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \((p_a \mid p_b) \, ? \, (p_c \mid p_d)\) where \(? \in \{<, =, >\}\).

2. **Initial Check for \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(n = 2\). For \(n = 2\), the permutation can only be \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\), and in both cases, \(p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1\), which is the maximum possible value. The program directly prints \(! 0 1\) and returns.

3. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The program initializes `max_index` to 0 and iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it compares \((p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}})\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_0 \mid p_i) > (p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}})\), it updates `max_index` to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when ORed with \(p_0\), gives the maximum value.

4. **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
   - The program initializes `min_indices` with the current `max_index`.
   - It then iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices}[0]})\) with \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i) < (p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices}[0]})\), it updates `min_indices` to \([i]\).
   - If \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i) = (p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices}[0]})\), it appends \(i\) to `min_indices`.
   - This step ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices \(i\) such that \((p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i)\) is minimized.

5. **Selecting the Minimum Index**:
   - The program initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It then iterates through `min_indices` and compares \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}})\) with \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\) in `min_indices`.
   - If \((p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i) = (p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}})\), it updates `min_index` to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that `min_index` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when ORed with itself, gives the same value as when ORed with any other element in `min_indices`.

6. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program prints \(! \text{max_index} \, \text{min_index}\) and returns.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the base case \(n = 2\).
- For \(n > 2\), the program finds the `max_index` by comparing the OR of \(p_0\) with all other elements.
- It then finds the `min_indices` by comparing the OR of `max_index` with all other elements.
- The final step ensures that the `min_index` is selected correctly from `min_indices` to maximize the XOR value.

### Query Count:
- The program makes \(n\) queries to find the `max_index`.
- It makes \(n\) queries to find the `min_indices`.
- It makes \(n\) queries to select the `min_index` from `min_indices`.
- The total number of queries is \(3n\), which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and follows the problem constraints. It correctly finds a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.

Correctness: **True**
