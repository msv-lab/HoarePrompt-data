Output State: **`min_index` is the last index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`. If all indices in `min_indices` are equal to `max_index`, `min_index` remains unchanged. The function `func_2` has been called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments, but the specific impact on the variables or return value is unknown without the definition of `func_2`.**
