Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and (1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged. The list `results` is now ready to store results, but currently contains no elements.
