Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists a where each inner list contains n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. Each inner list corresponds to a test case, and the length of each inner list is n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n',
            'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        
        rev_array = array[::-1]
        
        ans = []
        
        for j in range(l):
            ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
        
        print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each test case, and for each test case, it will print a string of characters. The characters in the string are determined by the count of the current element in the reversed array from the current position to the end. The final state of the variables `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` will be their values after the last iteration of the loop for the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` (the number of test cases), `l` will be the length of the last inner list in `a`, `array` will be the last inner list in `a`, `alp` will remain the list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` will be the reversed version of the last inner list in `a`, and `ans` will be the list of characters generated for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then generates a string of characters based on the count of each element in the reversed `array` from the current position to the end, using a predefined list of lowercase English letters. The function prints this string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` being set to their values after the last test case.
