Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the provided functions are unrelated to this task. For example, `func_1` simply reads an integer from input, `func_2` reads a list of integers, and `func_8` and `func_9` compute the cumulative product of elements in an array, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not perform the required operations to solve the problem.
