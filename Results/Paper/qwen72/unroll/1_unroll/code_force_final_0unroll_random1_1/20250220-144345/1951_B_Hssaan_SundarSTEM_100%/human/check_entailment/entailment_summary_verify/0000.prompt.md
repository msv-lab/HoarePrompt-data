You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

        s = list(map(int, input().split()))

            else:
                ans += 1
        p = j + 1
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans1 = 0
        (s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])
        z = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. The function then determines and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `s` that can be made non-decreasing by performing one or two specific swaps: either swapping the first element with the `k`-th element, or swapping the first element with the `k`-th element and then swapping the element at position `p` (determined during the process) with the `k`-th element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `s` remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the cow with the highest rating is at the position `k` and no swap is needed. In this scenario, the program incorrectly swaps the cow at position `k` with the first cow, which can lead to suboptimal results. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 10 4 5
```

The correct output should be `2` because the cow at position `3` (with rating `10`) can win the first two matches without any swaps. However, the program swaps the cow at position `3` with the first cow, leading to the following sequence of matches:
1. `10` vs `1` → `10` wins.
2. `10` vs `2` → `10` wins.
3. `10` vs `4` → `10` wins.
4. `10` vs `5` → `10` wins.

Thus, the program outputs `4`, which is incorrect. The optimal solution is to do nothing and let the cow at position `3` win the first two matches, resulting in `2` wins.
