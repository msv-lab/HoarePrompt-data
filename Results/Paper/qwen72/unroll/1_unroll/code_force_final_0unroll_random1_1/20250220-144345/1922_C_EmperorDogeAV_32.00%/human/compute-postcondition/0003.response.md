Output State: **The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers. The first element of `prog_cities` is always 1, and the last element is the distance between the second-to-last and last city in the list `cities`. All other elements are 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, otherwise, they are the distance to the next city.**
