Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element is either 1 or the distance to the next city in the list `cities`. The first element of `prog_cities` is always 1, and the last element of `prog_cities` is the distance between the second-to-last and last city in `cities`. All other elements are 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, otherwise, they are the distance to the next city.**
