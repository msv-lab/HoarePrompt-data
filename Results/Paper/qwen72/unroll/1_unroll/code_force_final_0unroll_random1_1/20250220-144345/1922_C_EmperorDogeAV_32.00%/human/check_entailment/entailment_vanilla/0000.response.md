### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to large values to handle edge cases (first and last cities).
   - For each city `i`, it checks the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (indicating the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays: `pref_sum_f` for the forward direction and `pref_sum_b` for the backward direction.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated based on the costs to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated similarly but for the backward direction after reversing the `cities` list.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by initializing `back` and `forward` to large values.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - The program correctly handles the direction of travel and uses the appropriate prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly, calculates the closest city costs, and uses prefix sums to efficiently answer the queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
