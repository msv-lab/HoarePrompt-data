### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input:** A list of cities on a number line with unique closest cities.
- **Output:** Minimum coins required to travel from one city to another for each query.
- **Constraints:** The closest city is unique for each city, and the cities are in strictly ascending order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the coordinates of the cities.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and the queries themselves.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` with `n-1` zeros.
   - It iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (traveling to the closest city for 1 coin).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city (traveling directly for the distance cost).

3. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum of `forward_cities`.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum of `backward_cities` (after reversing the cities).

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it checks if the starting city `a` is less than the ending city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.

#### Annotations:
- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order.
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \le n \le 10^5\).
  - Each city's coordinate \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9\).

- **State After `func_1` Call:**
  - `prog_cities` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element is either 1 or the distance to the next city.
  - The first element of `prog_cities` is always 1.
  - The last element of `prog_cities` is the distance between the second-to-last and last city.
  - All other elements are 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, otherwise, they are the distance to the next city.

#### Issues with the Original Assessment:
1. **Uniqueness of Closest City:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where the closest city is not unique.
   - However, the problem description guarantees that the closest city is unique for each city. Therefore, the program does not need to handle non-unique closest cities, and the assessment is incorrect in this point.

2. **Flawed Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for the given problem constraints. It correctly identifies the closest city and sets the cost to 1 if the next city is closer, otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.
   - The prefix sums are used to efficiently calculate the total cost for each query.

3. **Correctness of Prefix Sums:**
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums for both forward and backward directions.
   - It uses these prefix sums to determine the minimum cost for each query, which is the correct approach given the problem constraints.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the problem constraints and calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.
- The original assessment was incorrect in its claims about the program's handling of non-unique closest cities and the logic in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided.
