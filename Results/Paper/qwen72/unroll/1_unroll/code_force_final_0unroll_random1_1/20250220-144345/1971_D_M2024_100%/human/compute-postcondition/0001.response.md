The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `s` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
