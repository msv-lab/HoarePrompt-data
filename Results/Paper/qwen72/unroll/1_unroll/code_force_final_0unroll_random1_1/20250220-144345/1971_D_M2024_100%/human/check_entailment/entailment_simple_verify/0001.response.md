### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that can be cut from a given binary string such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `a` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If it encounters a transition from '1' to '0', it increments `cut1`.
     - If it encounters a transition from '0' to '1', it increments `cut0`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `cut0` is zero.
     - If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0's after '1's, and the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece. In this case, it prints `cut1 + 1`.
     - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are '0's after '1's, and the string needs to be cut into pieces to sort it. In this case, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies transitions between '0' and '1' and '1' and '0'.
   - The logic for determining the number of pieces is based on the transitions:
     - `cut1` counts the number of times '1' is followed by '0', which indicates the number of pieces needed to separate '1's from '0's.
     - `cut0` counts the number of times '0' is followed by '1', which indicates the number of times '0's need to be separated from '1's.
   - If `cut0` is zero, it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece, so the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If `cut0` is not zero, it means the string needs to be cut into pieces to sort it, so the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" and "1").
   - It also handles the case where the string has a single transition (e.g., "10").
   - It correctly handles the case where the string has multiple transitions (e.g., "11010" and "0110").

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples:
     - "11010" results in 3 pieces.
     - "00000000" results in 1 piece.
     - "1" results in 1 piece.
     - "10" results in 2 pieces.
     - "0001111" results in 1 piece.
     - "0110" results in 2 pieces.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function Definition**:
  - The function `func()` does not take any arguments, which is correct for the given problem description since the input is read directly from `input()`.
  - The function processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.

- **Transition Counting**:
  - The program correctly counts the transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1'.
  - The counters `cut0` and `cut1` are reset for each test case, ensuring that the count is accurate for each individual string.

- **Piece Calculation**:
  - The logic for calculating the number of pieces is correct:
    - If `cut0` is zero, the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece, so the number of pieces is `cut1 + 1`.
    - If `cut0` is not zero, the string needs to be cut into pieces to sort it, so the number of pieces is `cut0 + cut1`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles all edge cases correctly:
    - Strings with no transitions (e.g., "00000000" and "1") are correctly identified as already sorted.
    - Strings with a single transition (e.g., "10") are correctly identified as needing 2 pieces.
    - Strings with multiple transitions (e.g., "11010" and "0110") are correctly identified as needing 3 and 2 pieces, respectively.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to sort a binary string. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.
