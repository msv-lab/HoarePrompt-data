Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input.
   - This matches the problem description where the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.

2. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The function counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`).
   - These transitions are crucial for determining the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted by cutting at each '1' to '0' transition. Therefore, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If there are transitions from '0' to '1', it means the string has at least one '0' followed by a '1', and the minimum number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string with only '0's or only '1's, `cut0` will be 0, and the function will print `cut1 + 1`, which is correct because no cuts are needed.
   - For a string like '10', the function will correctly count one transition from '1' to '0' and print `2` (one piece for '1' and one piece for '0').

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement to count the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
   - The function resets `cut0` and `cut1` for each test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
