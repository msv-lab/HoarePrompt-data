You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input provided. The variable `ans` is calculated for each pair of `x` and `n`, and the final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed. After all iterations, the values of `x` and `n` are the last pair of values read from input, and `ans` is the last calculated value for that pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from input. The function then calculates the largest integer `ans` such that `x - n * ans` is divisible by `ans` and is non-negative. After processing all test cases, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `x` and `n` are updated for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `x` and `n` read from input, and the last calculated value of `ans` for that test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the maximum balance 1. However, the current logic in the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 2
```
Here, `x = 7` and `n = 2`. The only way to break 7 into 2 sub-problems is to have difficulties of 1 and 6, or 2 and 5, or 3 and 4. In all these cases, the GCD is 1. However, the program will not correctly identify this and may output an incorrect result.

The issue lies in the logic that checks for valid sub-problem difficulties:
```python
if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
```
This condition is not sufficient to ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given `n` and `i`. A more robust check is needed to ensure that the difficulties are valid and the GCD is maximized.
