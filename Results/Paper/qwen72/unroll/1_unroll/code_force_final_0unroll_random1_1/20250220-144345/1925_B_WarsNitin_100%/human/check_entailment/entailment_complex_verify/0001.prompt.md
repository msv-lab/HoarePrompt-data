You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input provided. The variable `ans` is calculated for each pair of `x` and `n`, and the final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed. After all iterations, the values of `x` and `n` are the last pair of values read from input, and `ans` is the last calculated value for that pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from input. The function then calculates the largest integer `ans` such that `x - n * ans` is divisible by `ans` and is non-negative. After processing all test cases, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `x` and `n` are updated for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `x` and `n` read from input, and the last calculated value of `ans` for that test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems) for a given problem difficulty `x` and the number of sub-problems `n`.
   - The balance is maximized when the difficulties of the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems:
     - `x % i == 0` ensures that `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - `x - n * i >= 0` ensures that the total difficulty of the sub-problems does not exceed `x`.
     - `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the sub-problems.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to ensure that we consider all possible divisors.
   - The maximum valid divisor is stored in `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (e.g., `5 5`), where the only possible sub-problems are of difficulty 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 1, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem but is implicitly covered by the algorithm.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`1 <= x <= 10^8`).
   - The complexity of the loop is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \), which is feasible for the given range.

5. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given difficulty `i`.
   - The conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the corresponding divisor `x // i`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It efficiently checks all possible divisors and ensures that the conditions for forming valid sub-problems are met.

Correctness: **True**
