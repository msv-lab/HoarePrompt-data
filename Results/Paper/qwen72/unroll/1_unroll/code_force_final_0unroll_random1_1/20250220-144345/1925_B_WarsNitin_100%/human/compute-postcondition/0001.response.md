Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input provided. The variable `ans` is calculated for each pair of `x` and `n`, and the final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed. After all iterations, the values of `x` and `n` are the last pair of values read from input, and `ans` is the last calculated value for that pair.**
