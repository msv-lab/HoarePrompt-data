### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems) for a given problem difficulty `x` and the number of sub-problems `n`.
   - The balance is maximized when the difficulties of the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems:
     - `x % i == 0` ensures that `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - `x - n * i >= 0` ensures that the total difficulty of the sub-problems does not exceed `x`.
     - `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the sub-problems.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to ensure that we consider all possible divisors.
   - The maximum valid divisor is stored in `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (e.g., `5 5`), where the only possible sub-problems are of difficulty 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 1, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem but is implicitly covered by the algorithm.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`1 <= x <= 10^8`).
   - The complexity of the loop is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \), which is feasible for the given range.

5. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given difficulty `i`.
   - The conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the corresponding divisor `x // i`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It efficiently checks all possible divisors and ensures that the conditions for forming valid sub-problems are met.

Correctness: **True**
