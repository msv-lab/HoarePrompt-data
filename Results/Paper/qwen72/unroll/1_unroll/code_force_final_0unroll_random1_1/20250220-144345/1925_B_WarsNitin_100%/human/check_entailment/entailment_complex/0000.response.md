Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset that sums up to a given difficulty \( x \) and consists of \( n \) sub-problems. The program iterates over possible divisors of \( x \) to find the largest divisor \( i \) such that \( x - n \times i \) is non-negative and divisible by \( i \). This approach is based on the fact that if \( x \) can be divided into \( n \) sub-problems with a common divisor \( i \), then \( i \) must be a divisor of \( x \).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \).

2. **Finding the Maximum Balance**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it checks if \( x - n \times i \) is non-negative and divisible by \( i \). If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and \( i \).
     - It also checks the corresponding divisor \( x // i \) to ensure that both \( i \) and \( x // i \) are considered. This is important because the divisors of \( x \) come in pairs \( (i, x // i) \), and we need to consider both to find the maximum possible GCD.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible divisors, the program prints the value of `ans` for the current test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. It ensures that the sum of the sub-problems is \( x \) and that the GCD of the sub-problems is maximized. The use of \( \sqrt{x} \) in the loop is efficient because it reduces the number of iterations needed to check all divisors of \( x \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
