To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\) and the values \(k - 1 - \text{sum of the elements in } ans\), \(k + 1\), and \(2 * k + 1\).
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` remains the length of `b`.
- `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `lk` remains the length of `bk`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(lk, l)` is not empty.
- For `range(lk, l)` to be non-empty, `l` must be greater than `lk`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.
- The loop will execute if `l` is greater than `lk`.
- The variable `i` will start at `lk` and increment up to `l-1`.

### Final State:
- `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\) and the values \(k - 1 - \text{sum of the elements in } ans\), \(k + 1\), and \(2 * k + 1\).
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` remains the length of `b`.
- `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `lk` remains the length of `bk`.
- `l` must be greater than `lk`.
- `i` is initialized to `lk`.

State: **`ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\) and the values \(k - 1 - \text{sum of the elements in } ans\), \(k + 1\), and \(2 * k + 1\); `n` and `k` remain unchanged; `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` remains the length of `b` and must be greater than `lk`; `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` remains the length of `bk`; `i` is `lk`.**
