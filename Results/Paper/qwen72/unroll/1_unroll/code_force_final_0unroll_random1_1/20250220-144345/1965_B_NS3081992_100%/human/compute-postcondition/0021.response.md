Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` remains the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, ..., 2]. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\); `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; and `lk` remains the length of `bk`.***
