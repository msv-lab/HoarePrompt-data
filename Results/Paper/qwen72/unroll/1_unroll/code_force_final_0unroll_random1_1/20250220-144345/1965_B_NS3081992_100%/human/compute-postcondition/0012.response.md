Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list, and the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
