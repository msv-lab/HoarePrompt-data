The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly initialized or adjusted. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
