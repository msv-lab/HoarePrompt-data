Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

The code snippet calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
