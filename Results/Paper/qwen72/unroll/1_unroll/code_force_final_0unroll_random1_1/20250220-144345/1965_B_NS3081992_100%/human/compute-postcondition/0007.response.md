Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3].**

The code snippet `ans = [2, 3]` initializes the variable `ans` to a list containing the values 2 and 3. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code. The current value of `k` is still 1, and `n` is still not equal to 2.
