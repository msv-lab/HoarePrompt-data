The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might accept a list of test cases `t` and for each test case, a list of four integers `p_i` where each integer is between 0 and 200. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values in `p_i`.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, and the output is not specified, I will assume that the function is designed to process these inputs internally (e.g., through user input or predefined variables) and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a list of four integers between 0 and 200. It returns a result for each test case based on the values provided.**
