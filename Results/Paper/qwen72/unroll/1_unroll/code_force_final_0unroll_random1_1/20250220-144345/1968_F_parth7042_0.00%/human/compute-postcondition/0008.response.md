The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `q`: an integer where 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, representing the array of integers.
- `queries`: a list of `q` pairs of integers (l, r) where 1 <= l < r <= n, representing the range queries.

The function returns the results of the queries based on the input parameters. Each query (l, r) returns a result that is specific to the functionality being implemented, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of queries. For each query (l, r), it returns a result based on the elements in the list `a` within the range (l, r). If the sum of `n` over all test cases or the sum of `q` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^5, the function's behavior is undefined.**
