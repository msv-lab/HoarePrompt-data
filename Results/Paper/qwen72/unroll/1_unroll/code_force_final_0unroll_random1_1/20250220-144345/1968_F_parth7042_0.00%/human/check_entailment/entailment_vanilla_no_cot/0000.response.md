Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and for each query, it determines whether the specified subarray can be split into parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program uses prefix XORs to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray and a dictionary to track the positions of each prefix XOR value. This allows it to quickly check if a subarray can be divided into the required parts by looking for specific conditions in the dictionary. The output format also matches the problem requirements, including the case-insensitive "YES" and "NO" responses.
