Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. The function outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query, followed by an empty line for each test case. The final state of the program includes the `idx` variable being `2 * (t + q * t)` and the `results` list containing `t * q + t` strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by an empty string for each test case. **
