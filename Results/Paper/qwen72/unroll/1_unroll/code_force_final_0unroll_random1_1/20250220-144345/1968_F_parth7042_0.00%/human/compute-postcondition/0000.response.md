The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state provided information about the function parameters and their constraints, but this code snippet does not directly affect those parameters. The only change is that `data` now holds the split input.

Output State: **The function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, and a list of integers `a`, and a list of queries. `t` is an integer where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, and each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
