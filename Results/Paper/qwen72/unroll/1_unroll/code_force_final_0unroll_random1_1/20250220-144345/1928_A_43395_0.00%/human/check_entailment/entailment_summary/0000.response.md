Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the parity of the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not correctly determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given one.

1. **First Condition:**
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if both dimensions are even. If both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a different rectangle. This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Second Condition:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples, and the `or` operator will always evaluate them as `True` because tuples are truthy in Python. This means that the program will always print 'no' if the first condition is not met, which is not the correct behavior.

3. **Third Condition:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, this is not a valid check for the problem. The correct condition should be whether at least one of the dimensions is even. If at least one dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and form a different one. This part of the logic is also incorrect.

4. **Fourth Condition:**
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is a catch-all for any other cases not covered by the previous conditions. However, due to the incorrect logic in the previous conditions, this condition is also flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and form a different one. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

Given the flawed logic in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
