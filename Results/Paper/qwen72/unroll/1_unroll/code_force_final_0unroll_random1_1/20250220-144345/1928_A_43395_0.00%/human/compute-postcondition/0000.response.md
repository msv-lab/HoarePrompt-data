The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` is automatically managed by the loop, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
