The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a sorted list of integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. For each test case, it calculates a list `array2` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `arr` and the values of `a` and `b`. It then checks if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements in `arr` and `b` is less than `f`. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of `test_cases` remains unchanged.
