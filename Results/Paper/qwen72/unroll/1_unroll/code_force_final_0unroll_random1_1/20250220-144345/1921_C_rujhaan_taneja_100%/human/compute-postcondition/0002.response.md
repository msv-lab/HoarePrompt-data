Output State: **The value of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged. For each test case, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are processed, and the list `arr` is read. The list `array2` is populated based on the conditions within the loop. After processing all test cases, the loop prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the final conditions. The state of `feat`, `arr`, and `array2` is reset for each test case.**
