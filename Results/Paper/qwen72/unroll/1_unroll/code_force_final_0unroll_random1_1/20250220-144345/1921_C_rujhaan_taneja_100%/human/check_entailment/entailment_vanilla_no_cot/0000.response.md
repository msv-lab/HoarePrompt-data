Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few logical issues that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Initial Charge Check for the First Message:**
   - The program checks if the first message can be sent by comparing `arr[0]` with `b / a`. However, this is incorrect because the phone starts at moment 0 with `f` units of charge. The correct check should be if `f` is greater than or equal to `arr[0] * a`.

2. **Charge Calculation for Subsequent Messages:**
   - The program calculates the charge required for subsequent messages by checking if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. This is incorrect because it should check if the phone can be turned on and off between messages. The correct condition should be if the phone can be turned off and on without running out of charge, which is `f >= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a + b`.

3. **Summing the Charge:**
   - The program sums the charge required for the messages and then adds `(n - len(array2)) * b` to it. This is incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the charge required to turn the phone on and off between messages. The correct approach should be to sum the charge required for the messages and then check if the total charge is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output Case Sensitivity:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" and "No" with lowercase 'y' and 'n'. The problem description specifies that the output should be "YES" and "NO" (all uppercase).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total charge required to send all messages
        total_charge = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                total_charge += arr[0] * a
            else:
                total_charge += (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a + b
        
        # Check if the total charge required is less than or equal to the initial charge
        if total_charge <= f:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Correctness Explanation:
- **Initial Charge Check:** The first message is sent at `arr[0]` and requires `arr[0] * a` units of charge.
- **Subsequent Messages:** Each subsequent message requires `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` units of charge to keep the phone on during the interval and `b` units of charge to turn the phone on and off.
- **Total Charge Calculation:** The total charge required is the sum of the charge for all messages and the charge for turning the phone on and off between messages.
- **Output:** The program correctly outputs "YES" if the total charge required is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`, and "NO" otherwise.
