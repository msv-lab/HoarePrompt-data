You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter the number of test cases, `t`, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `results` list to the console in the order they were added. The list `results` remains unchanged after the function concludes.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this approach does not correctly model the game's rules, particularly the optimal play strategy. The game involves players making strategic decisions to swap wallets or not, and then removing a coin, which can lead to different outcomes depending on the initial number of coins and the sequence of moves.

A counterexample where the program fails is:
- **Input:** `a = 2`, `b = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `Alice`
- **Actual Output:** `Bob`

In this case, Alice can win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, making `a = 1` and `b = 2`. Then, Bob will remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 1` and `b = 1`. Alice will then remove a coin from her wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 1`. Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 0`. Since Bob's wallet is now empty, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it only checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd, which does not capture the strategic nature of the game.
