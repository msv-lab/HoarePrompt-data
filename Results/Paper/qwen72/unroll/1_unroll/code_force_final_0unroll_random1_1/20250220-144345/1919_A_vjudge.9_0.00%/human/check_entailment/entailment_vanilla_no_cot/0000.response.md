Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins. This is because if the total number of coins is even, the game will always end with Bob making the last move, assuming both players play optimally.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins. This is because if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always be able to make the last move, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
