You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string is a pair of characters. elements is a dictionary mapping each entity (player, goal, Quaffle) to its position (row, column) on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary mapping each player to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the positions of the goals for the respective team. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}
    allPlayers = {}

    #State: `n` and `m` remain the same specific odd integers, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements read from the input, `elements` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to unique elements in the grid (excluding ` '..'`) and values as tuples representing their positions, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to player elements in the grid (if any) and values set to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, each with tuples representing the positions of the goal elements for each team (if any), `points` remains `[0, 0]`.

    #State: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` will be modified based on the commands read from the input. Specifically:
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the score of the first player and [points[1]] is the score of the second player)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
