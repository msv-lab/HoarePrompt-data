The function `func_1` reads a grid configuration and a series of commands from standard input. It initializes and updates the positions of players, the Quaffle, and goals on the grid, and tracks the scores of two teams (red and blue). The function processes each command to move players, transfer the Quaffle, score points, and handle special events like catching the Golden Snitch or eliminating players. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores of the red and blue teams. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
