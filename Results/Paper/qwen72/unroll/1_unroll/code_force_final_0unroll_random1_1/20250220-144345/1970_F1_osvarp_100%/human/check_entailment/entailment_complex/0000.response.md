### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m` and initializes the grid, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points`.
   - The grid is correctly parsed, and the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle are stored in the `elements` dictionary.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary is initialized to track whether each player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list is initialized to store the positions of the goals for each team.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes `t` commands, each describing an action performed by an entity.
   - For commands with three parts (e.g., player catching the Quaffle), the function updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - For commands with two parts (e.g., player moving or throwing the Quaffle):
     - **Movement:** The function updates the position of the entity based on the direction given.
     - **Throwing the Quaffle:** The function checks if the player is at a goal position using the `goalIn` function. If so, it updates the score and prints the appropriate message.
     - **Elimination:** The function checks if a player and the Bludger (`.B`) are in the same position and prints an elimination message.

3. **Goal Checking:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly checks if a position is in the red or blue team's goal and returns the appropriate team index or -1 if the position is not a goal.

4. **Player Checking:**
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies if a given string represents a player (i.e., starts with 'B' or 'R' and the second character is a digit).

5. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final score of the red and blue teams.

### Issues:
- **Bludger and Golden Snitch Handling:**
  - The function includes logic for handling the Bludger (`.B`) and the Golden Snitch (`.S`), which are not mentioned in the problem description. This suggests that the function might be handling additional rules that are not part of the current problem.
  - The Golden Snitch catch event (`'.S'`) is not relevant to the problem, and the Bludger elimination event (`'.B'`) is also not part of the problem description.

- **Quaffle Reset:**
  - When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. However, the function does not explicitly reset the Quaffle's position in the `elements` dictionary after a goal is scored.

- **Player Movement and Quaffle Carrying:**
  - The function does not handle the case where a player moves while carrying the Quaffle. The Quaffle's position should be updated to match the player's position if the player is carrying it.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` contains additional logic for handling the Bludger and Golden Snitch, which are not part of the problem description. Additionally, it does not reset the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored, and it does not update the Quaffle's position when a player moves while carrying it. These issues make the program incorrect based on the problem description.

### Correctness: **False**
