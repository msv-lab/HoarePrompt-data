Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - `func_1` reads the grid size `(n, m)` and initializes the grid.
   - It also initializes dictionaries and lists to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, and goals.
   - The function correctly identifies players and goals and stores their positions.

2. **Command Processing**:
   - The function processes each command in the sequence provided.
   - It handles movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) by updating the positions of the entities.
   - It correctly handles the Quaffle being caught and thrown by players.
   - The function checks if a player is at a goal position and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies when a player scores a goal by checking if the player is at a goal position of the opposite team.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Special Events**:
   - The function handles special events like catching the Golden Snitch and eliminating players, though these are not relevant to the basic scoring rules described in the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the events in the correct format and order, including the final score.

6. **Helper Functions**:
   - `goalIn` correctly identifies the goal positions and returns the appropriate team index.
   - `isPlayer` correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries, the program correctly processes the game actions, updates the positions of entities, and calculates the scores according to the rules. The special events (catching the Golden Snitch and eliminating players) are not part of the basic problem but do not interfere with the core functionality of scoring goals and updating the final score.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
