The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) and returns a pair of integers. Depending on the input conditions, the function can return one of the following pairs:
1. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0).
2. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is positive, it returns the results of calling `func_1(b, a)` with the arguments swapped.
3. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)).
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, it returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a % b)`.
