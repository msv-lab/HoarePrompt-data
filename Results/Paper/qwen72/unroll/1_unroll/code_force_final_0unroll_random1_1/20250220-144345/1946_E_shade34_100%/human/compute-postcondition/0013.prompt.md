You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0.
    #State: a and b are integers such that b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns `d` and `c`, which are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` is an integer less than `b` and `b` is a positive integer.
    #State: a and b are integers such that b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b.
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns 1 and a negative value that is one less than the result of integer division of `a` by `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers such that b > 0, a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) and returns different pairs of values based on the input conditions. If a specific condition is met, it returns 1 and 0. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is positive, it returns the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`. If another specific condition is met, it returns 1 and a negative value one less than the integer division of `a` by `b`. Otherwise, it returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a % b)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1 and 0.

Case_2: The program returns `d` and `c`, which are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` is an integer less than `b` and `b` is a positive integer.

Case_3: The program returns 1 and a negative value that is one less than the result of integer division of `a` by `b`.

Case_4: The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
