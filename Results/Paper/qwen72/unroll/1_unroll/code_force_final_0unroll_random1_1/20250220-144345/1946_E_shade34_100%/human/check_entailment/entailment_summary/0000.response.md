### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of different permutations that could have these indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `c` and `d` such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
     - In the context of the problem, it is used to compute the modular inverse of a factorial value, which is necessary for the combination calculations.

   - **`func_2(a, b)`**:
     - This function computes the result of \(a \cdot b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(b^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of `b` computed by `func_1`.
     - It is used to compute binomial coefficients modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - **Factorial Precomputation**:
     - The program precomputes factorials up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores them in the list `facts`.
     - This is a common optimization technique for problems involving combinations and permutations.

   - **Input Handling**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
     - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the indices of the suffix maximums `s`.

   - **Validation**:
     - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is the same as the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, and if the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is 1 and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`.
     - If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

   - **Combination Calculation**:
     - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums.
     - For each suffix maximum index `x`, it computes the binomial coefficient \(\binom{kol-1}{n-x}\) and updates the answer.
     - For each prefix maximum index `x` (excluding the last one), it computes the binomial coefficient \(\binom{kol-1}{x-1}\) and updates the answer.
     - It also multiplies the answer by the factorial of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the precomputation of factorials and modular inverses.
   - It correctly validates the input conditions to ensure that a valid permutation is possible.
   - The combination calculations and the multiplication of factorials are performed correctly to count the number of valid permutations.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly computes the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Correctness: **True**
