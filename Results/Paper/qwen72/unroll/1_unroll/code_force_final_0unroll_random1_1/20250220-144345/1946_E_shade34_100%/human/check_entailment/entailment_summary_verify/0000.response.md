### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of different permutations of a given length `n` that could have been guessed based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The input consists of the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, the number of suffix maximums `m2`, the indices of the prefix maximums, and the indices of the suffix maximums.
   - The output should be the number of suitable permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function appears to be an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - The function returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` and `d` are the coefficients such that `a * c + b * d = gcd(a, b)`.
     - This function is not directly related to counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

   - **`func_2(a, b)`**:
     - This function calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and returns the result of `c * a % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1`.
     - The function `func_2` is typically used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Again, this function is not directly related to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires a specific algorithm to count permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve this problem. They are more related to number theory and modular arithmetic, which are not directly applicable to the permutation counting problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions do not address the problem requirements.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the task of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
