Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not directly address the problem of counting the number of suitable permutations given the prefix and suffix maximums. However, the annotated version of the code reveals that the main logic for solving the problem is actually present in the main part of the program, not just in the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Factorials**:
   - The program initializes a list `facts` with factorials up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \). This is necessary for computing combinations and permutations efficiently using modular arithmetic.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), followed by the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \( n \). If these conditions are not met, it prints 0, which is correct because these conditions are necessary for a valid permutation.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to \( n \).
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and computes the number of ways to arrange the elements between the current suffix maximum and the next one using combinations and factorials.
   - It then processes the prefix maximums in reverse order, similarly computing the number of ways to arrange the elements between the current prefix maximum and the next one.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

### Function Analysis:

- **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is indeed implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \).
  - The function correctly handles the base case and recursive steps, ensuring it can find the modular inverse when \( b \) is \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function correctly computes the modular inverse of \( b \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using the result from `func_1`.
  - It then multiplies the modular inverse by \( a \) and returns the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Main Logic Evaluation:

- The main logic correctly uses the factorials and modular inverses to compute the number of suitable permutations.
- The program ensures that the conditions for a valid permutation are met and then calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the maximums.
- The use of modular arithmetic is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required modulo.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program does not solve the given problem. The main logic of the program is indeed designed to count the number of suitable permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums, and it uses the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to handle the necessary modular arithmetic.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
