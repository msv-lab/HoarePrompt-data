a and b are lists of integers where a represents the indices of prefix maximums and b represents the indices of suffix maximums, and both lists are sorted in increasing order. Additionally, there exists an integer n such that 1 <= len(a), len(b) <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of a and b satisfy 1 <= a[i], b[i] <= n.
