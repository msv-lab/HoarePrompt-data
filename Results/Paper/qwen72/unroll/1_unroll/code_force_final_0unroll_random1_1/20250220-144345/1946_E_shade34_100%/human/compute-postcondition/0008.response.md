Output State: **The program returns 1 and a negative value that is one less than the result of integer division of `a` by `b`.** 

In natural language, this means:
- The program returns the number 1.
- It also returns a negative number, which is calculated by taking the integer division of `a` by `b` (which is a whole number since `a` is divisible by `b`), subtracting 1 from it, and then negating that result. For example, if `a` is 10 and `b` is 2, the integer division `a // b` is 5, so the second value returned is -(5 - 1) = -4.
