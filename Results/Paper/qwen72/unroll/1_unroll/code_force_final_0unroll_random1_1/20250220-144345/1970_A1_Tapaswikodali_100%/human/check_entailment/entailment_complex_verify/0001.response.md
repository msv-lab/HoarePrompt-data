### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix and then sorting the characters based on the balance and position.

2. **Function 1:**
   - This function is a comparison function used to sort the `balance_info` list.
   - It correctly compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance. If the balances are different, it sorts by balance in ascending order.
   - If the balances are the same, it sorts by position in descending order.
   - The function is correctly implemented to achieve the required sorting behavior.

3. **Function 2:**
   - This function takes a string `s` as input and performs the balanced shuffle operation.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character.
   - It iterates through the string, computing the balance of each prefix and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to the list.
   - The balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis '(' and decremented for a closing parenthesis ')'.
   - After computing the balance for all characters, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the comparison function defined in `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **BalanceInfo Class:**
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.
   - The class should be defined as:
     ```python
     class BalanceInfo:
         def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
             self.balance = balance
             self.position = position
             self.character = character
     ```
   - The class definition is correct and matches the requirements of the problem.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly computes the balance of each prefix.
   - The sorting logic is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
   - The construction of the result string is correct.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

Final: **True**
