Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return any value but prints a string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on their balance values and positions. Specifically, the characters are sorted such that those with the same balance value are ordered by their position in descending order, and then the characters are concatenated into a single string. **
