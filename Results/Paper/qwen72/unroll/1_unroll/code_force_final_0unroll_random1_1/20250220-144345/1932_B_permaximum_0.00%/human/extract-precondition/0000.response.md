Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.
