Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the logic used to compute the year is flawed. The program uses the expression `year += year % ai or ai` to update the year, which is intended to find the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the previous sign has occurred. 

However, this expression does not correctly handle the sequential waiting for signs. Specifically, the expression `year % ai or ai` will be `ai` if `year % ai` is 0 (i.e., if `year` is a multiple of `ai`), and `year % ai` otherwise. This means that if `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the program will add a non-zero remainder to `year`, which is incorrect. Instead, the program should find the next multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than the current `year`.

To correctly compute the year for the i-th sign, the program should use the following logic:
1. Find the next multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than the current `year`.
2. Update `year` to this next multiple.

The correct way to do this is to use the formula:
\[ \text{next\_year} = \left( \left\lceil \frac{\text{year} + 1}{\text{ai}} \right\rceil \right) \times \text{ai} \]
This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than the current `year`.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly compute the year for the n-th sign, and thus the output will be incorrect for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
