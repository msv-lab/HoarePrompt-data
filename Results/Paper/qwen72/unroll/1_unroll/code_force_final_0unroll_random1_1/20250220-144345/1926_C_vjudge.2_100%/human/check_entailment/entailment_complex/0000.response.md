### Reasoning:
1. **Precomputation of `pd` List**:
   - The program initializes a list `pd` of length 200001 with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to 200000.
   - For each `i`, it adds the sum of the digits of `i` to `pd[i]` and also adds the cumulative sum from `pd[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `pd[n]`.
   - Since `pd[n]` is precomputed to be the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, this step correctly outputs the required sum for each test case.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(N) time, where N is 200000. This is efficient and well within the time limit.
   - Each test case query runs in O(1) time, as it simply involves a list lookup. This is very fast and suitable for up to 10^4 test cases.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The program uses a list `pd` of length 200001, which is a reasonable amount of space for the given constraints.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly computes the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case.
   - The precomputation ensures that the results are accurate and the queries are efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It efficiently precomputes the necessary sums and handles the test cases within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
