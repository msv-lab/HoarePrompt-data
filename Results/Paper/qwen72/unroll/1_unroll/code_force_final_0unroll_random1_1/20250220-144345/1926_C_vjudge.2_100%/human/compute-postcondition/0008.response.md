Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from user input. The function precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all the digits of the integers from 1 to i, inclusive, plus the cumulative sum of the previous elements in the list. After precomputation, the function prints the value of `pd[n]` for each test case. The list `pd` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
