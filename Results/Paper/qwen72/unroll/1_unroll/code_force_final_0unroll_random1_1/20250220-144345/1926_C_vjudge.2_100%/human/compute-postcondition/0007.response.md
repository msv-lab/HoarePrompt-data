The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function likely operates with two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function operates with two implicit parameters `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
