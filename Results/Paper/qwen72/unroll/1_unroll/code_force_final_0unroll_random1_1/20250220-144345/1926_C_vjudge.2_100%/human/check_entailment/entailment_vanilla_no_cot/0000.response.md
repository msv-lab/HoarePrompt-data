Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is set to 200001 to cover the range of possible values for `n` (1 to 200000).
   - `t` is read from input to determine the number of test cases.
   - `pd` is a list of size `N` initialized to 0. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each number from 0 to 200000.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to 200000.
   - For each number `i`, it updates `pd[i]` to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - This precomputation step ensures that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` from input.
   - It then prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n`.

This approach is efficient and meets the time limit requirement because:
- The precomputation step runs in O(N) time, where N is 200000.
- Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the `pd` list.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
