The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the constraints and relationships between them.
