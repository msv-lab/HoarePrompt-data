### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` of size 1000001 to count the occurrences of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It populates `cnt_b` with the counts of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subarray.
   - It checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (from `a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (from `a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting `cnt_b`:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes and updates the count array `cnt_b` to keep track of the elements in `b`.
- The sliding window approach is used efficiently to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
- The function correctly updates the count of matching elements (`curr`) and the answer (`ans`).
- The function resets the count array `cnt_b` for the next test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the sliding window approach ensures that the solution is efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
