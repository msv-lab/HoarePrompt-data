### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and creates a list `cnt_b` of size 1,000,001 filled with zeros. This list is used to count the occurrences of elements in `b`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - For each test case, the function reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The function updates `cnt_b` to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subarrays.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will store the count of matching elements in the current subarray.
   - The function checks the first subarray of `a` of length `m`:
     - For each element in the first subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (from `a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (from `a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after each slide, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting `cnt_b`:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to zero to prepare for the next test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is correctly implemented to efficiently check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
  - The function correctly updates the count of matching elements (`curr`) and the total count of good subarrays (`ans`).

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge cases where `k` is 1 or `m` is equal to `n`.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of unique elements in `b`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The function is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n + m)\) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. It correctly counts the number of good subarrays in `a` for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
