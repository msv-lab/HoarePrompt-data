Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires dividing a list of books into two non-empty piles such that Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read by Alice.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - The program uses the expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` to determine the maximum number of pages Alice can read.
   - `nums[:-1]` creates a list of all books except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the book with the highest number of pages from the first pile (all books except the last one).
   - `nums[-1]` is the last book, which is always in the second pile.
   - The sum of these two values is the total number of pages Alice can read.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic assumes that the last book is always in the second pile and the book with the highest number of pages from the remaining books is in the first pile.
   - This approach is correct because the problem is to maximize the sum of the highest pages in each pile. By placing the last book in one pile and the highest of the rest in the other pile, we ensure that the two largest values are used, which is the optimal solution.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum number of books (2) correctly.
   - It also handles larger numbers of books (up to 100) correctly by always selecting the last book and the highest of the rest.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
