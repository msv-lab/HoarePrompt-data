### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the owner's cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a` and adjusts `k` to be zero-indexed.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum number of matches the owner's cow can win.
   - It initializes `x` to the rating of the owner's cow (`a[k]`).
   - It also initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and appends their indices to `ind`.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - The owner's cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If this cow is in position 0 (`ind[0] == 0`), the owner's cow can win `k - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is after the owner's cow (`ind[0] > k`), the owner's cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is before the owner's cow (`ind[0] <= k`), the owner's cow can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
   - **Case 3: Two or more cows have a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) > 1`):**
     - If the first higher-rated cow is in position 0 (`ind[0] == 0`), the owner's cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` or `k - 1` matches.
     - If the owner's cow is after the second higher-rated cow (`k > ind[1]`), the owner's cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
     - Otherwise, the owner's cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program contains a debug print statement for `k == 14`, which is not relevant to the correctness of the solution and should be removed.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is complex but seems to cover all the necessary cases based on the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the owner's cow is the highest-rated cow (`ind` is empty).
   - It also handles the case where there is only one higher-rated cow and the owner's cow is either before or after it.
   - For the case where there are two or more higher-rated cows, the program correctly determines the optimal position for the owner's cow to maximize wins.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of wins the owner's cow can achieve. The debug print statement is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the solution. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
