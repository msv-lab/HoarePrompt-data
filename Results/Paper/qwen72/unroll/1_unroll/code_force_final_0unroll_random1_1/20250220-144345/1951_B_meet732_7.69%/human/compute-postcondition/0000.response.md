Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.** 

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, consisting of `n` unique integers within the specified range. The variable `x` is now equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`.
