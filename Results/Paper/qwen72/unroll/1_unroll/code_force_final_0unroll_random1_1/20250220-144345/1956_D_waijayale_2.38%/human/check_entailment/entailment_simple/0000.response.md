Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. The program uses a recursive approach to achieve this goal.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to set the elements of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` to the MEX of that subarray and record the operation.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If so, it appends the operation `(l, l)` and sets `a[l]` to 0.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself to process the subarray `a[l+1:r+1]`. After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If so, it appends the operation `(l, r)` and sets all elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is the core recursive function that decides whether to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - If `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Base Case in `func_1`**:
  - The base case in `func_1` where `l == r` is incorrect. Setting `a[l]` to 0 is not always the correct MEX. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
  - **Correct Base Case**: If `l == r`, the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which is 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, and 1 if `a[l]` is 0.

- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It assumes that the MEX is always `r - l + 1`, which is not true.
  - **Correct MEX Calculation**: The MEX should be calculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

- **Incorrect Sum Calculation in `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` calculates the sum `s` of the subarray and compares it to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This comparison is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
  - **Correct Approach**: The function should directly calculate the MEX and apply the operation if it increases the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in the MEX calculation and the base case handling in `func_1`. These issues prevent the program from correctly maximizing the sum of the array elements and constructing the correct sequence of operations.

Correctness: **False**
