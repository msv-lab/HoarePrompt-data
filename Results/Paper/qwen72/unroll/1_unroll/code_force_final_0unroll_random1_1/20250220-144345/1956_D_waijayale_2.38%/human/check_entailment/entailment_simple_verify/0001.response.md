### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a subarray `a[l:r]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations are limited to no more than 5 * 10^5.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation is crucial. For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX is the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the MEX but instead sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` under certain conditions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where the subarray `a[l:r]` is being processed.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If not, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray `a[l:r]` to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - **Issue**: The function assumes that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is always the correct MEX value, which is not necessarily true. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not just `r - l + 1`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Issue**: The function does not handle the MEX calculation correctly, as it relies on `func_1` which has the aforementioned issue.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r]` and compares it to the maximum possible sum, which is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position, then recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly identify the MEX value. It assumes that if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, the MEX is `r - l + 1`, which is incorrect.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.
     - **Issue**: Since `func_2` and `func_1` are incorrect, the results printed by `func_3` will also be incorrect.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the MEX for a subarray.
   - The recursive approach is flawed because it assumes that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is always the correct MEX value.
   - The number of operations is limited to 5 * 10^5, which is sufficient given the constraints (n â‰¤ 18), but the operations themselves are incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by setting the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - However, it does not handle the general case of MEX calculation correctly.

6. **Optimization**:
   - The recursive approach is designed to ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum, but the incorrect MEX calculation negates this optimization.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it incorrectly calculates the MEX value for subarrays. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the program assumes it is always `r - l + 1`, which is not true in general. Therefore, the program will not always produce the correct maximum sum of the array.

Final: **False**
