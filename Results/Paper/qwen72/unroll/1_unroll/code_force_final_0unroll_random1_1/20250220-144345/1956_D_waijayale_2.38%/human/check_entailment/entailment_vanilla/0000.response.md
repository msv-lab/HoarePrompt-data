### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX will be the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where the subarray `a[l:r]` is being processed.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If not, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray `a[l:r]` to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r]` and compares it to the maximum possible sum of the subarray, which is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position, then recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX for a subarray and applies the operation to maximize the sum.
   - The recursive approach ensures that the subarrays are processed in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The number of operations is limited to 5 * 10^5, which is sufficient given the constraints (n ≤ 18).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by setting the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray sum is already maximized by not performing any operations.

6. **Optimization**:
   - The recursive approach ensures that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum without exceeding the operation limit.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by recursively applying the MEX operation to subarrays in a way that maximizes the sum of the array. The constraints are respected, and the operations are applied efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
