Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. Specifically, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined but not used correctly. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Additionally, the condition in `func_1` where it checks `if a[l] != r - l + 1` is not always correct. The MEX operation should be applied to the range `[l, r]` to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, but the code directly sets `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` without computing the MEX.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 0
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  10 1
  1 4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will likely raise a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

To fix this, the `ops` list should be passed correctly to `recursive_maximize_sum`, and the MEX computation should be implemented correctly.
