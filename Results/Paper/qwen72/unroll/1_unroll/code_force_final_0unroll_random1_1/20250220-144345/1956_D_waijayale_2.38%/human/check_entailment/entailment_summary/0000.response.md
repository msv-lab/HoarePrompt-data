Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls**:
   - `func_3` reads the input correctly, processes the array `a` by calling `func_2`, and prints the required output. This function seems to handle the input and output as specified in the problem.

2. **Sum Maximization Logic**:
   - `func_2` is supposed to maximize the sum of the array `a` and return the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves. However, the function does not actually call `func_1` or `recursive_maximize_sum` with the correct parameters. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` but does not pass the `a` and `ops` lists to it, which is a mistake.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` is designed to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`. It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the subarray length. If so, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to the subarray length and appends the operation to `ops`. If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
   - The function `func_1` is called correctly within `recursive_maximize_sum` and performs the necessary modifications to the subarray and appends the operations to `ops`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` modifies the subarray `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements to `r - l + 1` if any element is not already equal to `r - l + 1`. It also appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and ensures that the subarray is modified as required.

5. **Output Format**:
   - `func_3` prints the maximum sum `s` and the number of operations `m` correctly. It also prints the operations in the format required by the problem.

However, there is a critical issue in `func_2` where it does not pass the `a` and `ops` lists to `recursive_maximize_sum`. This means that `recursive_maximize_sum` will not have access to the necessary data to perform its operations correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

Given this issue, the program as a whole does not meet the problem description and will not produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
