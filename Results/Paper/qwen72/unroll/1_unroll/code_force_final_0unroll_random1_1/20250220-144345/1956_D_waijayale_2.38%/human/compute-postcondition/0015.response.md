Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= `a[i]` <= 10^7. If `s` <= `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, the values of `a[l]` to `a[r]` inclusive are all set to `r - l + 1`, and `s` is updated to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, with the tuple `(l, r)` remaining in the list `ops`. If `s` > `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `s` is the sum of the integers from `a[l]` to `a[r]` inclusive, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the list `a` starting from `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, the function retains all the initial conditions.**
