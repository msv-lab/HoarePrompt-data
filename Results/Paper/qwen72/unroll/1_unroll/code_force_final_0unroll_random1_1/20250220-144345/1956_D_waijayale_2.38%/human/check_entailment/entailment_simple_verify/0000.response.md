Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies two main issues with the provided program:

1. **Scope of `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined to modify the `ops` list, but it is called in `func_2` without passing the `ops` list. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - The correct call should be `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1, ops)` to ensure that `ops` is accessible within `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX computation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` directly sets `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` without computing the MEX of the range `[l, r]`. This is incorrect because the MEX operation should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`.
   - The MEX computation is missing, which is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm.

Let's break down the annotated code and the original assessment to validate these points:

### Annotated Code Analysis

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function is designed to handle the base case where `l == r` and sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0.
  - For the recursive case, it calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If so, it appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops` and sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`.
  - The MEX computation is missing, which is a critical part of the problem.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - The call to `recursive_maximize_sum` is incorrect because it does not pass `ops`.

- **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
  - This function sums the elements in the range `[l, r]` and checks if the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
  - If the condition is met, it calls `func_1` to perform the operation and updates the elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`.
  - If the condition is not met, it finds the maximum value in the range and recursively applies the function to the left and right subranges.
  - The function does not pass `ops` to `func_1`, which is a critical error.

- **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
  - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
  - The function itself is correct in terms of input and output handling, but it relies on the incorrect behavior of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Specifically, the `ops` list is not passed correctly, and the MEX computation is missing in `func_1`.

Final: **False**
