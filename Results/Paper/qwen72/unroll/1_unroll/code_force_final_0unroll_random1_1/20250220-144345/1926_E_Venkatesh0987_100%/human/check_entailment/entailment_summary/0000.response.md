### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the \( k \)-th card laid down by Vladislav, who lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, and so on. The program provided seems to follow this logic, but let's break it down step-by-step to ensure correctness.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the \( k \)-th card is an odd number. The program correctly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \), which is the \( k \)-th odd number.

3. **Non-Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - If \( k \) is greater than \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the program enters a more complex logic to determine the \( k \)-th card.
   - The variable `s` is used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `i` is used to count the number of iterations (or rounds) needed to reach or exceed \( k \).
   - The variable `d` is initialized to \( n \) and is used to decrement the number of cards left to consider.
   - The variable `h` is also initialized to \( n \) and is used similarly to `d` but in a different loop.
   - The variable `p` is used to count the number of iterations in the second loop.
   - The variable `g` is used to keep track of the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \).

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `s` by the largest possible odd number from `d` until `s` is at least \( k \). This loop also increments `i` to count the number of iterations.
   - The second `while` loop calculates the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \) and stores it in `g`.
   - The variable `f` is then calculated as the difference between \( k \) and `g`.
   - Finally, the program prints \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), which is the \( k \)-th card laid down in the non-odd-numbered rounds.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \) by printing the \( k \)-th odd number.
   - For \( k \) greater than \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the program correctly calculates the \( k \)-th card by considering the rounds of laying down cards that are multiples of odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It handles both the odd-numbered and non-odd-numbered cases appropriately. The execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
