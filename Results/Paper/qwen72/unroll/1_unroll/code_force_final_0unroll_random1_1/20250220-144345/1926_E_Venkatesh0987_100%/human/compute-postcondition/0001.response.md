Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints a value based on the conditions given. If \( k > \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the loop calculates and prints a value \( y \) which is \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \), and \( f \) is the difference between \( k \) and the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). If \( k \leq \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the loop directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). The values of \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \) remain unchanged after the loop execution.**
