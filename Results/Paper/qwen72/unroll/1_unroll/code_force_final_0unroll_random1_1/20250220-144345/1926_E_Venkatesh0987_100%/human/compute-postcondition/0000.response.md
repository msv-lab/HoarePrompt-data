The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` does not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the overall program state.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and is constrained to be between 1 and 50,000, the input should match this constraint for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
