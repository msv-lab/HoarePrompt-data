Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it prints a value based on the following conditions: If \( k \) is greater than \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it calculates and prints a value \( y \) which is \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \), and \( f \) is the difference between \( k \) and the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
