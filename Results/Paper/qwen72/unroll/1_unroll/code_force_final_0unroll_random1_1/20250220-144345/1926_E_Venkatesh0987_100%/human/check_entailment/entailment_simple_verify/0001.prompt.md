You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: For each test case, the loop prints a value based on the conditions given. If \( k > \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the loop calculates and prints a value \( y \) which is \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \), and \( f \) is the difference between \( k \) and the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). If \( k \leq \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), the loop directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). The values of \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \) remain unchanged after the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first all odd numbers, then all numbers that are twice an odd number, then all numbers that are three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - The program has two main branches: one for when `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` and one for when `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Case 1: \( k \leq (n + 1) // 2 \)**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus one, the k-th card is an odd number.
   - The program prints `2 * k - 1`, which correctly generates the k-th odd number.
   - This is correct because the first half of the cards laid down are the odd numbers in ascending order.

4. **Case 2: \( k > (n + 1) // 2 \)**
   - If `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, the k-th card is not an odd number.
   - The program uses a loop to determine the position of the k-th card in the sequence of cards that are multiples of powers of 2.
   - The loop increments `i` to count the number of rounds of laying down cards.
   - The variable `s` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The loop continues until `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - After the loop, the program calculates the position `f` of the k-th card in the current round.
   - The final card is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which correctly generates the k-th card in the sequence of multiples of powers of 2.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the first half of the cards (odd numbers).
   - The program correctly handles the second half of the cards (multiples of powers of 2).
   - The logic for determining the position of the k-th card in the sequence of multiples of powers of 2 is sound and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It handles both the odd-numbered cards and the multiples of powers of 2 in the correct order and correctly determines the k-th card laid down.

### Correctness:
**True**
