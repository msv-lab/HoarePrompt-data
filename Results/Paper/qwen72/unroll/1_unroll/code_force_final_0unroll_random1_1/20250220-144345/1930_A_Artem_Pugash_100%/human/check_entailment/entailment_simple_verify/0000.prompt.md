You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The variable `score` is the sum of the smallest n integers from the list `a` for each iteration of the outer loop, and this value is printed for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score by selecting the minimum of each pair of integers from the sorted list. Here's why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first when forming pairs.

2. **Pair Selection**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element. For each pair, it adds the first element (which is the smaller one in the sorted list) to the score. This is optimal because the smallest number in each pair will always be the minimum, and by selecting the smallest numbers first, we maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Correct Output**: The program correctly prints the score for each test case, and it handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

Let's verify a few edge cases:

- **Single Test Case with n=1**: 
  - Input: `1\n2 3`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Correct.

- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - Input: `3\n1\n2 3\n2\n1 1 2 1\n3\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted Lists: `[2, 3]`, `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Scores: `2`, `2`, `3`
  - Output: `2\n2\n3`
  - Correct.

- **Larger n**:
  - Input: `1\n4\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Score: `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16`
  - Output: `16`
  - Correct.

- **All Elements are the Same**:
  - Input: `1\n4\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Output: `4`
  - Correct.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and there are no evident edge cases or logical flaws, the program is correct.
