Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and erasing both integers.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer to ensure that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the list of integers ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element (starting from the first element), we are effectively selecting the minimum of each pair.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - It reads the list of 2n integers and sorts them.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the list of integers, which is a crucial step in ensuring that the minimum of each pair is selected.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - The function prints the score for each test case, which is the correct output format.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format, including multiple test cases.
   - The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - The iteration through the sorted list, taking every second element, correctly implements the strategy of adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

Given the above reasoning and the function summary, the program is indeed correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Final: **True**
