Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The variable `score` is the sum of the smallest n integers from the list `a` for each iteration of the outer loop, and this value is printed for each iteration.**
