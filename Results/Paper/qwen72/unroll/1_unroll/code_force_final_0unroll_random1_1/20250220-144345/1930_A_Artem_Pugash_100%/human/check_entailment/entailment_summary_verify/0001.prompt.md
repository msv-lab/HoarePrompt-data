You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then calculates the sum of the smallest n integers from the list and prints this sum. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated sum for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are no longer relevant, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer.
   - This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, which is the optimal strategy because it minimizes the loss of larger values.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - This is because the sorted list will pair the smallest elements together, and the minimum of each pair will be the first element in the pair.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - It reads the list of 2n integers and sorts them.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element and adding it to the score.
   - The logic of taking every second element from the sorted list ensures that we are always adding the minimum of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.
