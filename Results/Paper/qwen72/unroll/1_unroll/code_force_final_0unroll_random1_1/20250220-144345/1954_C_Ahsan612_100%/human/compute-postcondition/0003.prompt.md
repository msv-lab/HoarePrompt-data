You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will output two lines. The first line will contain the maximum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will contain the minimum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. `x` and `y` are integers for each test case, with 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function processes these parameters for each test case and returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
