Output State: **The loop reads input lines from the standard input (excluding the first line), parses each line to get `n` and `k`, and prints the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions provided. The variables `n` and `k` will be updated for each iteration of the loop, but their final values will be the ones from the last input line. The state of other variables remains unchanged.**
