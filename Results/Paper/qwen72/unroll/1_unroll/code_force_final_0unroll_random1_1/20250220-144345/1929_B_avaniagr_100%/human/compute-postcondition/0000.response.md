The only object in the loop head is `s`, and the loop is iterating over the result of `[*open(0)][1:]`. For the loop to execute, the result of `[*open(0)][1:]` must be a non-empty list. This means that `open(0)` must return an iterable with at least two elements (since the first element is being sliced off with `[1:]`).

State: **`[*open(0)]` must be a list with at least 2 elements, `s` is the second element in the list**
