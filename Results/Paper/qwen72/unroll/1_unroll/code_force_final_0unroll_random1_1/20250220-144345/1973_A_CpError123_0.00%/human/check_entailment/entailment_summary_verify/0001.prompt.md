You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 if the conditions for calculating ties are not met, or the number of ties (equalities) calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop. The conditions for calculating ties include: the total points (sum of p_1, p_2, and p_3) being even, the total matches (half of total points) being 3 or less, and p_3 not exceeding the total matches. If these conditions are met, the number of ties is calculated and appended to `resultats`; otherwise, -1 is appended.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the list `cas_de_test`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `cas_de_test`.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points `total_points` is even. This is correct because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 points for a win/loss and 2 points for a draw).
   - If `total_points` is odd, the program appends `-1` to the results, which is correct because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given scoring system.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect. The number of matches can be more than 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` because `p3` can be the result of multiple draws and wins.
   - The correct check should be to ensure that the total number of matches is non-negative and that the scores are consistent with the possible outcomes of the games.

5. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the possible number of draws.
   - The correct approach is to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent. The maximum number of draws can be calculated by minimizing the number of wins/losses.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to calculate the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the total points are even and that the scores are consistent with the possible outcomes of the games.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated as `total_points // 2 - (p3 - p2 + p2 - p1) // 2`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        wins_losses = (p3 - p2 + p2 - p1) // 2
        draws = total_matchs - wins_losses
        if draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(draws)
    return resultats

t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Points Check**: Ensure the total points are even.
- **Total Matches Calculation**: Calculate the total number of matches.
- **Wins and Losses Calculation**: Calculate the minimum number of wins/losses required to achieve the scores.
- **Draws Calculation**: Subtract the number of wins/losses from the total matches to get the maximum number of draws.
- **Feasibility Check**: Ensure the number of draws is non-negative. If not, append `-1`.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
