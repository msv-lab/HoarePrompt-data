Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list of integers, each either -1 or the number of ties (egalites) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test` based on the loop's conditions.
