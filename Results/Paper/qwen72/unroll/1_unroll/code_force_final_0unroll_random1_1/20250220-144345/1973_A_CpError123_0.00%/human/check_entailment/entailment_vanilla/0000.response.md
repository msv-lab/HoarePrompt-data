### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have three players with scores \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Each game can result in a win (2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser) or a draw (1 point to each player).
   - We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

2. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The total points \( \text{total\_points} = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \).
   - Since each game (whether a win or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 for a win, 2 for a draw), the total points must be even. If \( \text{total\_points} \) is odd, the scores are inconsistent, and we return -1.

3. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The total number of matches \( \text{total\_matchs} = \text{total\_points} // 2 \).
   - This is because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The maximum number of matches that can be played is 3 (since there are only 3 players and each match involves 2 players).
   - If \( \text{total\_matchs} > 3 \), the scores are inconsistent, and we return -1.
   - Additionally, the highest score \( p_3 \) should not exceed the total number of matches, as each match can only contribute a maximum of 2 points to any player. If \( p_3 > \text{total\_matchs} \), the scores are inconsistent, and we return -1.

5. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula to calculate the maximum number of draws is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total score, and each win contributes 2 points as well.
   - The number of draws \( \text{egalites} \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
     \]
   - This formula subtracts the points that would have been gained from wins (since wins contribute 2 points to the total score, but we are only interested in the points from draws).

6. **Final Check:**
   - If \( \text{egalites} \) is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, and we return -1.
   - Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is \( \text{egalites} // 2 \).

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
  - The function `func_1` is called with the number of test cases and the list of scores.

- **Total Points Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it appends -1 to the results.

- **Total Matches Check:**
  - The program calculates the total number of matches and checks if it exceeds 3. If so, it appends -1 to the results.
  - It also checks if \( p_3 \) exceeds the total number of matches. If so, it appends -1 to the results.

- **Draws Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula:
    \[
    \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
    \]
  - It then checks if \( \text{egalites} \) is negative. If so, it appends -1 to the results.
  - Otherwise, it appends \( \text{egalites} // 2 \) to the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to return -1 if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct.
