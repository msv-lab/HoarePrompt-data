The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`A` is a list where each element represents the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered in `s` up to that point, adjusted by the distance from the last '>' character and the number of '>' characters encountered so far, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
