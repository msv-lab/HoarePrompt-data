### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters '<' and '>'. A pinball placed at any cell will move left or right based on the character at that cell and will stop when it leaves the grid.
   - The goal is to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the results.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `A` and `idx_A` are used to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters from the start.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are used to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters from the end.
   - **First Loop:**
     - The loop iterates from the start of the string to the end.
     - If a '>' is found, it appends a value to `A` and `idx_A`.
     - The value in `A` is calculated based on the distance from the last '>' and the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - **Second Loop:**
     - The loop iterates from the end of the string to the start.
     - If a '<' is found, it appends a value to `B` and `idx_B`.
     - The value in `B` is calculated similarly to `A` but in reverse.
   - **Third Loop:**
     - This loop iterates through each cell to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - It uses the values in `A` and `B` to compute the time based on the direction of the pinball and the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters.
     - The logic is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios.

4. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle edge cases correctly, particularly when the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
   - The assessment mentions that for the input string `">"`, the pinball should leave the grid in 1 second, but the program does not output the correct result.

5. **Testing the Edge Case:**
   - Let's test the program with the input `">"`.
   - For `n = 1` and `s = ">"`:
     - `A` will be `[0]` and `idx_A` will be `[0]`.
     - `B` will be empty and `idx_B` will be empty.
     - In the third loop, `i = 0`:
       - `s[0] == '>'` is true.
       - `l = 0` and `r = 0`.
       - The condition `if l < r` is false.
       - The condition `elif r == 0` is true.
       - The program prints `n - i = 1 - 0 = 1`, which is correct.

6. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the time to leave the grid is based on the cumulative counts and indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The conditions in the third loop handle different scenarios, including edge cases and cases where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
   - The program correctly accounts for the inversion of the characters after each move and the cumulative effect of these inversions.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does handle the edge case correctly, as demonstrated by the test with `">"`.
   - The logic, while complex, appears to be designed to handle all possible scenarios and edge cases.
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle edge cases correctly.
