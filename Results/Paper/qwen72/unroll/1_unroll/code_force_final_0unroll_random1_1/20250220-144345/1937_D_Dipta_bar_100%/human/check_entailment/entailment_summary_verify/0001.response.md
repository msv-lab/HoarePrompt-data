### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the grid string `s` as an argument.
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of pinballs starting from the left and right, respectively.

3. **Left to Right Movement (`A` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '>', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `A` and the positions stored in `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated as the sum of the previous cumulative movement plus the distance from the last '>' to the current cell, multiplied by the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - The position `i` of each '>' is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Right to Left Movement (`B` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '<', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated similarly to the left to right movement, but in reverse.
   - The position `i` of each '<' is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` of the grid to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell `i` in the grid.
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each time separated by a space.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Movement Calculations:**
  - The cumulative movements in `A` and `B` are correctly calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
  - The logic for adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' is complex but necessary to handle the inversion of characters after each move.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle the edge case where the grid length `n` is 1. However, the logic in the program should still work correctly for this case because the pinball will leave the grid immediately, and the cumulative movement lists `A` and `B` will be empty or contain a single zero.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the pinball is placed on a cell with a single '<' or '>', ensuring it leaves the grid in the correct number of steps.

- **Complexity and Readability:**
  - The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks is indeed complex and could be simplified for better readability.
  - However, the complexity is necessary to handle the dynamic nature of the pinball movement and the inversion of characters.

- **Optimization:**
  - The program could be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve performance, but the current implementation is correct and will work within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input and output, and the logic for calculating the pinball movements and times is sound.
- Despite the complexity and potential for optimization, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
