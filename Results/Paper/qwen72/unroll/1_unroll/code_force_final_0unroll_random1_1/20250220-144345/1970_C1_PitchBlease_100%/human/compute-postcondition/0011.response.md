Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n). It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` list and identifies the leaf nodes. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaf nodes and calculates the distances. If either of these distances is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The original variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. **
