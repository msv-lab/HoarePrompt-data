The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the differences for all test cases have been printed, and the variables used in the function are no longer relevant.
