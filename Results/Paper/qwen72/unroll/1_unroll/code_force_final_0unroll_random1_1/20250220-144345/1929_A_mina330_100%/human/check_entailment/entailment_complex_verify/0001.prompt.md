You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list `a` has been printed. The variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been used and modified within the loop, but their final states are not directly relevant to the output. The initial state of `ntest` remains unchanged, and the list of lists provided as input has been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the differences for all test cases have been printed, and the variables used in the function are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks for the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, from the second element to the last element.

2. **Mathematical Insight**: The beauty of the array is given by:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1
   \]
   This means the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest element is at the beginning and the largest element is at the end.
   - The program then calculates the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array, which is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), correctly outputting `0` because the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where the array has only two elements, correctly outputting the difference between the two elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **True**
