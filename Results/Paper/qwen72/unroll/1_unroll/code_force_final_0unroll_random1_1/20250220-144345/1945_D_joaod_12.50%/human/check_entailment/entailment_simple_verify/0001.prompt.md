You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired final position in the queue. The variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the current test case, and this value is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the loop ends, and no changes are made to the variables `t` or `cases`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` (number of people) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), followed by the lists `a` (cost to swap with the person at position `j`) and `b` (cost to pay each person between `j` and `i`).

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `na_frente` to `n - 1` and `pos_final` to `m - 1` to account for zero-based indexing. It also initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`).

3. **Loop Through People**: The program iterates from the last person to the first person in the queue (from `na_frente` to 0). This is appropriate because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is because Kirill will choose the cheaper option to either swap with the person at position `v` or pay the people between `v` and the current position.

5. **Output**: After processing all positions, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already at the end of the queue) correctly.

7. **Optimization**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the minimum cost by iterating through the list in reverse and keeping track of the best cost found so far.

8. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should handle the given problem description and constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
