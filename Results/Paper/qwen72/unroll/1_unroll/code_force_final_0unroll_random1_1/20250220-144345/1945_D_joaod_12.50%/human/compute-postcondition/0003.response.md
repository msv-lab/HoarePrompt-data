The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person.
  - `b`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between the current and target positions.

The function returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of people in the queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), a list of costs to bribe each person in the queue (`a`), and a list of costs to bribe each person between the current and target positions (`b`). It returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue for each test case.**
