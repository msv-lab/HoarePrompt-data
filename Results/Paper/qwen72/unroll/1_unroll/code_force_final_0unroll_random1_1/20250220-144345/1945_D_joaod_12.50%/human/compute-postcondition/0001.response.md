The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` must start at 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9**
