Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, with 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_j` is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
