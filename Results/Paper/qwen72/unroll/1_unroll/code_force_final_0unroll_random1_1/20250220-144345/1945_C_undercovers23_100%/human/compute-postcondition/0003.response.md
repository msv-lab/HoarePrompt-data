The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly but reads input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where `a_j = 0` if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side, and `a_j = 1` if they want to live on the right side. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function writes the output to stdout, which is the result of processing each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` representing the preferences of residents for living on the left or right side of their houses. It processes each test case and writes the results to stdout.**
