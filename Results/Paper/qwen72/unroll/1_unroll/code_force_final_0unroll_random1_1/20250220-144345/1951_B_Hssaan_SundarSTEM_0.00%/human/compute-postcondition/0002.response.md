The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the given test cases and return a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
