The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over a range. The range is determined by the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must be greater than 0, meaning `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure the loop executes. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be set to `t` to ensure the loop runs `t` times.

State: **`_` is an iterator over a range of `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
