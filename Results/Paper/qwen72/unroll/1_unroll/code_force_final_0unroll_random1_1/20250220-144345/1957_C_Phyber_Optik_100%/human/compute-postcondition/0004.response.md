The function `func_1` is intended to be used as part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases, each with a different size of the chessboard `n` and a number of moves `k`. However, the function definition provided only includes the parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard. The function definition should be revised to include the parameter `k` and the move details (r_i, c_i) to fully describe its intended functionality.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept a positive integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard and an additional parameter `k` representing the number of moves, along with move details (r_i, c_i). However, the provided function definition only accepts `n`. The function should be revised to include all necessary parameters to process the chessboard and moves.**
