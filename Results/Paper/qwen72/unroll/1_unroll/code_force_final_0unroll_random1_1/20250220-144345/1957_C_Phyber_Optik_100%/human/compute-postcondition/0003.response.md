Output State: **`dp[n]` is the value calculated by the loop, which is `(dp[n - 1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[n - 2]) % 1000000007`.** 

In natural language, the output state is that the array `dp` will have its `n`-th element set to the result of the loop's final iteration, which is the value of `(dp[n - 1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[n - 2]) % 1000000007`. The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain unchanged as 1 and 3, respectively.
