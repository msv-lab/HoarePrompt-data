Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial moves, considering the computer's mirroring strategy. The core of the solution relies on dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of valid configurations for a given board size and the set of invalid positions due to the initial moves.

### Issues and Analysis:
1. **Function Definition and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with an argument `300000`, which is the maximum possible value of \( n \). This is done to precompute the DP values for all possible board sizes up to 300,000.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices, and `func_1` initializes `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` with the base cases. The loop then fills in the DP array for all values from 3 to \( n \).

2. **DP Calculation:**
   - The DP formula used is correct: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board:
     - `dp[i - 1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board.
     - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board by placing one rook in a new row and column, and then placing the remaining rooks on an \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then reads \( k \) moves.
   - It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The final result for each test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows and columns.

### Potential Issues:
- **Function Call and Initialization:**
  - The function `func_1` is called with `300000` before processing any test cases. This is a valid approach to precompute the DP values, but it should be noted that the function does not take \( k \) or the move details as parameters, which is not necessary for the DP precomputation.
- **Handling \( k \) Moves:**
  - The program correctly handles the \( k \) moves by marking the rows and columns as invalid.
  - However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where \( r = c \) (i.e., the computer skips its turn). This is implicitly handled by the set `invalid` because if \( r = c \), both \( r \) and \( c \) are added to the set, but the set will not count the same position twice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly precomputes the DP values and uses them to determine the number of valid configurations for each test case. It also correctly handles the invalid positions due to the initial moves. The implicit handling of the case where \( r = c \) is sufficient, as the set `invalid` will not double-count the same position.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
