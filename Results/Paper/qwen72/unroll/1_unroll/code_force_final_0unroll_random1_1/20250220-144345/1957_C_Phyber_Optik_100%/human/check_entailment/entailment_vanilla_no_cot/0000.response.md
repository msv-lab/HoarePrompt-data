Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of configurations for a given number of available positions.
   - `dp[1] = 1` because with 1 available position, there is only 1 way to place a rook.
   - `dp[2] = 3` because with 2 available positions, there are 3 ways to place rooks: (1, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 1) + (2, 2).

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of configurations for up to `n` positions using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]
     \]
   - This recurrence relation accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirrored moves and the constraints of the problem.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to the `invalid` set to keep track of the positions that are no longer available for placing rooks.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of available positions by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the result using the precomputed `dp` array, ensuring the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, and the dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of configurations is calculated efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
