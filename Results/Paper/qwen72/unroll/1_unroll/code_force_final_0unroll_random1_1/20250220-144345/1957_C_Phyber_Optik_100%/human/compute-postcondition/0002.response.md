The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least 3. Additionally, `i` should be set to 3, as this is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
