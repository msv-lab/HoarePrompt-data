### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results.
   - It also initializes two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

3. **First Loop (for `A` and `idx_A`):**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '<' character.
   - This is stored in the list `A`.
   - The index of each '>' character is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Second Loop (for `B` and `idx_B`):**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '>' character in reverse order.
   - This is stored in the list `B`.
   - The index of each '<' character is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Third Loop (for output):**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each character, it determines whether it is '>' or '<' and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The calculations involve using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time based on the position and the number of '>' and '<' characters before and after the current position.
   - The results are printed directly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is implemented correctly, considering the rules for movement and inversion of characters.
- The use of precomputed lists `A` and `B` ensures that the calculations are efficient and handle the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
