You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop prints a string that concatenates the characters in `ans` with the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters that are within the first `k` letters of the alphabet. If the function finds at least `n` such sequences, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, it prints 'NO' and then constructs a string by concatenating the characters from the sequences found, adding the first unique character from the first `k` letters of the alphabet that is not in the current sequence, and padding the rest of the string with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, where `n` is the length of the strings to check, `k` is the number of alphabets to use, and `m` is the length of the string `s`.
   - It then reads the string `s` from the input.
   - A set `us` is created containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - Another set `win` is initialized to keep track of the characters seen in the current window.
   - An empty list `ans` is initialized to store the characters that form a valid subsequence.
   - A variable `ps` is initialized to count the number of valid subsequences found.

3. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it is added to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains all `k` characters, the character `i` is added to the list `ans`, and `ps` is incremented.
   - The set `win` is then cleared to start a new window.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints "YES" because it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program iterates over the set `us` to find a character that is not in the set `win`.
   - If such a character is found, it is added to the list `ans` to form a missing subsequence.
   - The remaining characters in the subsequence are filled with 'a' to ensure the length is `n`.

### Issues and Incorrectness:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The program only checks if there are `n` windows where all `k` characters are present. This is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences.
   - For example, if `s = "abba"`, `n = 2`, and `k = 2`, the program will find two windows (`"ab"` and `"ba"`) and print "YES". However, it should also check for the subsequences "aa" and "bb".

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a missing subsequence by finding a character not in `win` and appending it to `ans`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid missing subsequence.
   - For example, if `s = "abb"`, `n = 2`, and `k = 2`, the program will print "NO" and then "aa", which is incorrect because "aa" is not a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. It only checks for the presence of `k` characters in a window, which is not the same as checking for all possible subsequences.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly constructs the missing subsequence.
