Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains unchanged: This means `n` is a predefined value.
- `k` remains unchanged: This means `k` is a predefined value.
- `m` remains unchanged: This means `m` is a predefined value.
- `s` remains unchanged: This means `s` is a predefined string.
- `us` remains unchanged: This means `us` is a predefined set of characters.
- `win` is an empty set: This means `win` is initially an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`: This means `ans` is a list that has been populated with the `k`-th unique characters from the string `s` that are also in the set `us`.
- `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`: This means `ps` is a counter that tracks how many times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`.
- `ps` is less than `n`: This means the value of `ps` is less than the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state does not affect the output of this `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
