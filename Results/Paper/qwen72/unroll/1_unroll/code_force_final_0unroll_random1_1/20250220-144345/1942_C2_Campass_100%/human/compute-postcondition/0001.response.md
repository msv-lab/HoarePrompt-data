Output State: **`t` is an integer value returned by the function `R()`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, the list of `x` vertices contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and `R` is a function that maps input to integers.**
