The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function `R` can be used later in the program to read and convert multiple space-separated integers from input. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices are not directly modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the function `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, the list of `x` vertices contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and `R` is a function that maps input to integers.**
