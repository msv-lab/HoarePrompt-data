#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0

    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `results` is a list of t integers, where each integer is the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of t integers, where each integer is the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case from the list `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` test cases, each containing a list of integers. It returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `test_cases`. After the function concludes, the `results` list contains the computed years for each test case.
