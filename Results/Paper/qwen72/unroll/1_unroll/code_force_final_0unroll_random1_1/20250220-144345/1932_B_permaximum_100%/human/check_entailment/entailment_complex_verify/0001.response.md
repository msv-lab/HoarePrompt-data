### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the periodicities for each test case. This is verified by the annotated code, which confirms that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

2. **Test Case Storage:**
   - The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in the list `test_cases`. This is consistent with the problem description and the annotations.

3. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and return the results. The function takes `t` and `test_cases` as parameters, which are correctly used in the function.

4. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - The logic to determine the next year when the sign occurs is:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - This logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. The annotations confirm that `current_year` is updated correctly to the next year for each sign.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are the years when the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `3` (next year: `3`)
  - Second sign: `2` (next year: `4`)
  - Third sign: `4` (next year: `8`)
  - Fourth sign: `5` (next year: `10`)
  - Fifth sign: `9` (next year: `18`)
  - Sixth sign: `18` (next year: `36`)
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `1` (next year: `1`)
  - Second sign: `2` (next year: `2`)
  - Third sign: `3` (next year: `3`)
  - Fourth sign: `4` (next year: `4`)
  - Fifth sign: `5` (next year: `5`)
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `1` (next year: `1`)
  - Second sign: `1` (next year: `2`)
  - Third sign: `1` (next year: `3`)
  - Fourth sign: `1` (next year: `4`)
  - Fifth sign: `1` (next year: `5`)
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `50` (next year: `50`)
  - Second sign: `30` (next year: `60`)
  - Third sign: `711` (next year: `711`)
  - Fourth sign: `200` (next year: `800`)
  - Fifth sign: `503` (next year: `1003`)
  - Sixth sign: `1006` (next year: `2012`)
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. It handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The annotated code and the example test cases confirm that the program behaves as expected.
