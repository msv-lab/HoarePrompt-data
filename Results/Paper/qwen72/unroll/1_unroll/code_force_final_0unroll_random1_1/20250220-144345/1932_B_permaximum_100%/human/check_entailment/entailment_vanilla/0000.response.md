### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Test Case Storage:**
   - The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, a)` in a list `test_cases`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and return the results.

4. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - The logic to determine the next year when the sign occurs is:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are the years when the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `3` (next year: `3`)
  - Second sign: `2` (next year: `4`)
  - Third sign: `4` (next year: `8`)
  - Fourth sign: `5` (next year: `10`)
  - Fifth sign: `9` (next year: `18`)
  - Sixth sign: `18` (next year: `36`)
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `1` (next year: `1`)
  - Second sign: `2` (next year: `2`)
  - Third sign: `3` (next year: `3`)
  - Fourth sign: `4` (next year: `4`)
  - Fifth sign: `5` (next year: `5`)
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `1` (next year: `1`)
  - Second sign: `1` (next year: `2`)
  - Third sign: `1` (next year: `3`)
  - Fourth sign: `1` (next year: `4`)
  - Fifth sign: `1` (next year: `5`)
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `current_year = 0`
  - First sign: `50` (next year: `50`)
  - Second sign: `30` (next year: `60`)
  - Third sign: `711` (next year: `711`)
  - Fourth sign: `200` (next year: `800`)
  - Fifth sign: `503` (next year: `1003`)
  - Sixth sign: `1006` (next year: `2012`)
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. It handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Correctness:
**True**
