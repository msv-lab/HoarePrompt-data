Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur in a way that the next sign's periodicity is a multiple of the current year. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
2 4 8
```

The expected output is `8`, but the program will output `10`. Here's the breakdown:

- The first sign occurs in year 2.
- The second sign should occur in year 4 (since 2 is a multiple of 2, the next year is 4).
- The third sign should occur in year 8 (since 4 is a multiple of 4, the next year is 8).

However, the program calculates the next year for the third sign as 10, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
