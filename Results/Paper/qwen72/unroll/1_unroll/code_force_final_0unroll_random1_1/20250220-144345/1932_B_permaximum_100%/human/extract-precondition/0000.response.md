Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
