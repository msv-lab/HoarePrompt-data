Output State: **The function `func` will have processed all test cases. For each test case, it will have computed and printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values will not be relevant to the output state.**
