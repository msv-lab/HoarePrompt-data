Output State: The function `func` processes all test cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are reset and updated for each test case, but the overall state of the function remains ready to handle the next test case or terminate if all test cases have been processed. The final state of the function is such that all test cases and queries have been evaluated and the appropriate output has been printed for each query.
