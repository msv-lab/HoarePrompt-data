c is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3·10^5), and queries is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
