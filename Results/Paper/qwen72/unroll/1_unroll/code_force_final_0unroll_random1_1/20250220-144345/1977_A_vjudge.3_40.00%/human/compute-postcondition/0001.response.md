The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to explicitly state the conditions for the loop to start, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 (the starting point of the range) and `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0**
