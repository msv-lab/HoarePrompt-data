The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length `n` representing the two rows of the grid. The function should be defined as `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`.
