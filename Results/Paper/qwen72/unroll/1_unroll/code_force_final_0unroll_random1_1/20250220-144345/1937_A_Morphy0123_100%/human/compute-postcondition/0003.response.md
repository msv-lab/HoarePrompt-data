The function `func` should accept a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the array `a` where initially `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. However, the provided function definition lacks this parameter. Assuming the function is correctly defined to include `n`, the function would return the array `a` with the specified initial values.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and returns an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is initialized to `i` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
