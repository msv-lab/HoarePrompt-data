Output State: **The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described but lacks parameters in its definition. The correct function definition should include a parameter `n` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the array `a` where initially `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. `n_cases` is an input integer.**
