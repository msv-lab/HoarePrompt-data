You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described but lacks parameters in its definition. The correct function definition should include a parameter `n` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the array `a` where initially `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` from the input, then print the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it will print 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it will print the next power of 2. The variable `power` will be reset to 1 at the start of each iteration, and the value of `n` will be updated to the result of `log2(n)` within each iteration. After all iterations, the loop will have no effect on any variables outside of its scope.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations is flawed.

### Issue:
The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) and then prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \). However, this approach does not correctly simulate the swap operations as described in the problem.

### Counterexample:
Consider \( n = 6 \). The initial array is:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \]

The swap operations are:
1. \(\text{swap}(2)\): \( [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] \)
2. \(\text{swap}(3)\): \( [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6] \)
3. \(\text{swap}(4)\): \( [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6] \)
4. \(\text{swap}(5)\): \( [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6] \) (no change since 5 is a prime)
5. \(\text{swap}(6)\): \( [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6] \) (no change since the largest divisor of 6 is 3, and 3 and 6 are already in the correct positions)

After all the operations, the array is:
\[ [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6] \]

The position of 1 in the resulting array is 4. However, the program would output 8, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the swap operations or derive a mathematical formula that correctly determines the position of 1 after all the swaps. The provided program does not do this correctly, hence it is incorrect.
