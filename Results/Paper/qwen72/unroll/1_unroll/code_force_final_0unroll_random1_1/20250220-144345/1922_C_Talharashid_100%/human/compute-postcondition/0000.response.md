The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the `range` function during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. This means the input value must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is controlled by the `range` function, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
