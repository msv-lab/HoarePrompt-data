You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the results of the loop calculations, and the outputs for each query are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city positions and a list of queries. It calculates the minimum distance to the closest city for each position in the list and stores these distances in two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`. For each query, it prints the difference in these distances between the specified cities. The function does not modify the input values `t`, `n`, `a`, or `queries`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city positions `l`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It initializes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the minimum cost to travel to the closest city from the left and right, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost to Travel to the Closest City:**
   - **Left to Right Calculation (`d1`):**
     - `d1[2] = 1` initializes the cost to travel from the second city to the closest city (which is the first city).
     - For each city `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
       - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it updates `d1[i + 2]` to be `1 + d1[i + 1]` (traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin).
       - Otherwise, it updates `d1[i + 2]` to be the distance to the next city plus the cost to travel to the next city.
   - **Right to Left Calculation (`d2`):**
     - `d2[n - 1] = 1` initializes the cost to travel from the second-to-last city to the closest city (which is the last city).
     - For each city `i` from `n-2` to 1:
       - If the distance to the previous city is less than the distance to the next city, it updates `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]` (traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin).
       - Otherwise, it updates `d2[i]` to be the distance to the previous city plus the cost to travel to the previous city.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the cities `x` and `y`.
   - If `y` is greater than `x`, it prints the cost to travel from `x` to `y` using the left-to-right dictionary `d1`.
   - If `y` is less than `x`, it prints the cost to travel from `y` to `x` using the right-to-left dictionary `d2`.

### Issues:
- **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors:**
  - The program uses `d1[2] = 1` and `d2[n - 1] = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `d1[1] = 0` and `d2[n] = 0` because the cost to travel to the closest city from the first city (index 0) and the last city (index `n-1`) should be 0.
  - The loop for `d1` should start from `i = 1` and go to `n-1`, and the loop for `d2` should start from `i = n-2` and go to `0`.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in the loops for `d1` and `d2` is incorrect. The program should calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city, not the cumulative cost.
  - The correct approach is to find the closest city for each city and store the cost to travel to that closest city.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize dictionaries to store the closest city and its cost
        closest_left = defaultdict(int)
        closest_right = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Calculate the closest city to the left for each city
        for i in range(1, n):
            closest_left[i] = i - 1 if l[i] - l[i - 1] <= l[i + 1] - l[i] else i
        
        # Calculate the closest city to the right for each city
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            closest_right[i] = i + 1 if l[i + 1] - l[i] <= l[i] - l[i - 1] else i
        
        # Calculate the cost to travel to the closest city
        cost_left = [0] * n
        cost_right = [0] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            cost_left[i] = 1 + cost_left[closest_left[i]]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            cost_right[i] = 1 + cost_right[closest_right[i]]
        
        m = int(input())
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            x -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            y -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            
            if y > x:
                print(cost_left[y] - cost_left[x])
            else:
                print(cost_right[x] - cost_right[y])

```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has logical errors in the way it calculates and stores the minimum cost to travel to the closest city. The corrected program addresses these issues by properly initializing the dictionaries and calculating the minimum cost for each city.
