You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the variable `cnt` has been calculated and printed. The value of `cnt` for each test case is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. The input variables and the loop control variable `_` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative: \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - For Alice to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be non-zero.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be paired up such that each pair has a zero XOR.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Each number \( x \) can be paired with another \( x \) to make the XOR zero.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from each count \( p_i \) is \( \lfloor p_i / 2 \rfloor \).

6. **Special Case:**
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal, removing one of each will make the XOR zero. This is because the XOR of three odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s will be zero, and removing one of each will leave an even count, which can be paired to zero.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal, and if so, increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the special case where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal.
   - The program correctly counts the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from each count.
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
