6 0
6 15
```
**Output**:
```
6
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 6 and `k` is 0 (no bridges destroyed) and 15 (all bridges destroyed).

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
10 0
10 45
```
**Output**:
```
10
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 10 and `k` is 0 (no bridges destroyed) and 45 (all bridges destroyed).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. Since there is only one island, the number of islands Everule can visit is always 1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 1 and `k` is 1. Since there is only one island, the number of islands Everule can visit is always 1, even if `k` is greater than 0.

**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 2 and `k` is 1. Since there is only one bridge, destroying it isolates Everule on island 1.

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 3 and `k` is 3. Since there are 3 bridges, destroying all of them isolates Everule on island 1.

100 4950
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 100 and `k` is 4950 (the maximum number of bridges). Since all bridges are destroyed, Everule can only visit island 1.

100 0
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 100 and `k` is 0. Since no bridges are destroyed, Everule can visit all 100 islands.

**Input**:
```
1
5 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 5 and `k` is 1. Since only one bridge is destroyed, Everule can still visit all 5 islands by using other bridges.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 5 and `k` is 2. Since only two bridges are destroyed, Everule can still visit all 5 islands by using other bridges.

**Input**:
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 5 and `k` is 3. Since only three bridges are destroyed, Everule can still visit all 5 islands by using other bridges.

**Input**:
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when `n` is 5 and `k` is 4. Since four bridges are destroyed, Everule can visit 4 islands, but one island will be isolated.
