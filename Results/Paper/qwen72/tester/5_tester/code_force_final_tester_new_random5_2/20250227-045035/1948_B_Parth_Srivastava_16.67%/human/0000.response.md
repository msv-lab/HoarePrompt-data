Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
NO
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the basic scenarios where the array can be sorted by applying the operation, cannot be sorted, and is already sorted.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
2
5
10 20 30 40 50
4
5 10 15 20
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks arrays that are already sorted and should remain sorted after any number of operations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
3
10 10 10
4
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks arrays where all elements are the same and are at least 10. Splitting them should still result in a sorted array.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
4
10 1 20 2
3
10 20 30
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks arrays where some elements are less than 10 and some are at least 10, but the array can still be sorted by applying the operation.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6

2
0 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks arrays with the minimum length (2) where one element is 10 and the other is 0. Splitting 10 should result in a sorted array.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```

YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum length of the array (50) where all elements are 10. Splitting any 10 should still result in a sorted array.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
50
99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum length of the array (50) where all elements are 99. Splitting 99 into 9 and 9 will not result in a sorted array.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
50
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum length of the array (50) where all elements are 0. The array is already sorted and no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2
99 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the minimum length of the array (2) where one element is the maximum possible value (99) and the other is the minimum possible value (1). Splitting 99 will not help in sorting the array.

**Input**:
```
1
2
10 9
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the minimum length of the array (2) where one element is 10 and the other is 9. Splitting 10 will not help in sorting the array.

2
9 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the minimum length of the array (2) where one element is 9 and the other is 10. The array is already sorted, and no operations are needed.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
3
10 10 9
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 3 where two elements are 10 and one is 9. Splitting the 10s will not help in sorting the array.

```
1
3
9 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 3 where one element is 9 and two are 10. The array is already sorted, and no operations are needed.

```
1
3
10 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 3 where the middle element is 9 and the other two are 10. Splitting the 10s will not help in sorting the array.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
4
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 4 where all elements are 10. The array is already sorted, and no operations are needed.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
4
10 10 10 9
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 4 where three elements are 10 and one is 9. Splitting the 10s will not help in sorting the array.

4
9 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 4 where one element is 9 and the other three are 10. The array is already sorted, and no operations are needed.

4
10 9 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an array of length 4 where the second element is 9 and the others are 10. Splitting the 10s will not help in sorting the array.
