**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is much greater than the target number of cubes, but the target is achievable.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**:

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is one more than the target number of cubes, which is achievable by adding one cube and then removing one.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```

1
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The number of moves is three more than the target number of cubes, which is not achievable.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: A large number of moves with a target that is half the number of moves, which is achievable.

**Input**: 
```
1
99 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: A large number of moves with a target that is slightly less than half the number of moves, which is achievable.
