Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the problem of forming non-degenerate triangles with sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\).

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Scenario**: All sticks have the same length, and any three sticks can form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: There are two valid combinations: (1, 2, 3) and (1, 3, 3). The lengths are \(2^3 = 8\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^3 = 8\).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because \(2 + 4 \leq 8\).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Only one stick is given, so it's impossible to form a triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^4 = 16\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the two smallest lengths is always less than or equal to the largest length.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... 1 (300,000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
49999850000
```
**Scenario**: All sticks have the same length, and the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 300,000 is \(\binom{300000}{3} = 49999850000\). This tests the upper limit of \(n\).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
300000
0 1 2 ... 299999 (300,000 distinct values)
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Each stick has a unique length from \(2^0\) to \(2^{299999}\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the two smallest lengths is always less than or equal to the largest length. This tests the upper limit of \(a_i\).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
...
0 (10,000 times)
```
**Scenario**: Each test case has only one stick, so no triangles can be formed. This tests the upper limit of \(t\).

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: All three sticks have the length \(2^0 = 1\). The only combination (0, 0, 0) forms a valid triangle. This tests the smallest non-zero length.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3
300000 300000 300000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: All three sticks have the maximum length \(2^{300000}\). The only combination (300000, 300000, 300000) forms a valid triangle. This tests the maximum length.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^4 = 16\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. This tests a small set of distinct lengths.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). Valid combinations are (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2), and (1, 2, 2). This tests a mix of repeated and distinct lengths.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
20
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^2 = 4\). Any combination of three sticks of length 2 can form a triangle, and any combination of two sticks of length 2 and one stick of length 4 can form a triangle. This tests a larger set of repeated lengths.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). Only one valid combination (1, 1, 2) can form a triangle. This tests a small set with repeated and distinct lengths.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^2 = 4\). Only one valid combination (1, 2, 2) can form a triangle. This tests a small set with repeated and distinct lengths.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: All three sticks have the length \(2^2 = 4\). The only combination (2, 2, 2) forms a valid triangle. This tests a small set of identical lengths.

# Test 17

```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: All three sticks have the length \(2^1 = 2\). The only combination (1, 1, 1) forms a valid triangle. This tests a small set of identical lengths.

# Test 18

```
1
3
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^0 = 1\), and \(2^1 = 2\). Only one valid combination (0, 0, 1) can form a triangle. This tests a small set with repeated and distinct lengths.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^1 = 2\). Only one valid combination (0, 1, 1) can form a triangle. This tests a small set with repeated and distinct lengths.

# Test 20
**Input**:

**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^3 = 8\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. This tests a small set with a large length.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
