1
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts, regular price, and promotion price are all 1. This tests the function's behavior with the smallest possible values.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is at the maximum limit (100), and both prices are 1. This tests the function's behavior with the maximum number of yogurts and the smallest prices.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 30 30
```
**Output**:
```
30
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 1, and both prices are at the maximum limit (30). This tests the function's behavior with the maximum prices.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100 30 30
```
**Output**:
```
3000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is at the maximum limit (100), and both prices are at the maximum limit (30). This tests the function's behavior with the maximum values for both number of yogurts and prices.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 30 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the promotion price is significantly lower than the regular price, ensuring the function correctly chooses the promotion price.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
3 1 30
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the regular price is significantly lower than the promotion price, ensuring the function correctly chooses the regular price.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
100 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is at the maximum limit (100), the regular price is 1, and the promotion price is 2. This tests the function's behavior with a very low regular price and a slightly higher promotion price.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
100 29 30
```
**Output**:
```
2900
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is at the maximum limit (100), the regular price is just below the maximum (29), and the promotion price is at the maximum (30). This tests the function's behavior with prices close to the maximum limit.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100 15 15
```
**Output**:
```
1500
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is at the maximum limit (100), and both prices are the same (15). This tests the function's behavior with equal prices.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 0. This tests the function's behavior with zero yogurts, which should result in zero cost.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 1, and the promotion price is higher than the regular price. This ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where the promotion is not advantageous.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
2 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
30
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 2, and the promotion price is just below double the regular price. This tests the function's behavior with prices close to the boundary condition.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
3 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
45
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 3, and the promotion price is just below double the regular price. This tests the function's behavior with a small number of yogurts and prices close to the boundary condition.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
4 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
58
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 4, and the promotion price is just below double the regular price. This tests the function's behavior with a small number of yogurts and prices close to the boundary condition.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
5 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
73
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of yogurts is 5, and the promotion price is just below double the regular price. This tests the function's behavior with a small number of yogurts and prices close to the boundary condition.

These test cases should help ensure that the function is thoroughly tested and can handle a wide range of inputs, including edge cases.
