### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
1 5
2 3
2 5
6 51
```
**Output**: 
```
5
1 2
5 0
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the example provided in the problem statement. It includes different values of `n` and `k` to ensure the basic functionality is verified.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the simplest non-zero values for `k` and `n`. It ensures that the sequence is correctly generated with the minimum number of elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 10
2 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
5 5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `k` is a single-digit number and `n` is 1 or 2. It ensures that the sequence sums up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2
1 100
2 100
```
**Output**: 
```
100
50 50
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `k` is a larger number and `n` is 1 or 2. It ensures that the sequence sums up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum value of `k` (10^9) with `n` being 1. It ensures that the function can handle the largest possible input for `k`.

# Test 6
**Input**:
