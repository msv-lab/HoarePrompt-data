**Scenario**: This test case checks a sequence where one slime is significantly larger than the others. The large slime cannot be eaten, and all other slimes can be eaten in one second by their larger neighbors.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a sequence where one slime is significantly larger than the others, but it is the first slime. The first slime cannot be eaten, and all other slimes can be eaten in one second by their larger neighbors.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 100 1 100 1 100 1 100 1 100

```
1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a sequence where slimes alternate between a very small size and a very large size. The small slimes can be eaten in one second, and the large slimes cannot be eaten.
