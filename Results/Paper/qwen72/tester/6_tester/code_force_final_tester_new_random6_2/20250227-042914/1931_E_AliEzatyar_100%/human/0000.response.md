Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse either 14 or 2. If she reverses 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 10^2. If she reverses 14, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is also greater than 10^2. Sasha wins in both cases.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any of the numbers. If she reverses 56 to get 65, Sasha can concatenate 65 and 9 to get 659, and then concatenate 659 and 1 to get 6591, which is less than 10^5. Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any of the numbers. If she reverses 2007 to get 7002, Sasha can concatenate 7002 and 1 to get 70021, and then concatenate 70021 and 800 to get 70021800, and finally concatenate 70021800 and 1580 to get 700218001580, which is greater than 10^10. However, if Anna reverses 1580 to get 851, Sasha can only get numbers less than 10^10. Anna wins.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any of the numbers. If she reverses 5000 to get 5, Sasha can concatenate 5 and 123 to get 5123, and then concatenate 5123 and 30 to get 512330, and finally concatenate 512330 and 4 to get 5123304, which is greater than 10^5. Sasha wins.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any of the numbers. Regardless of her move, Sasha can always concatenate numbers to get a result greater than 10^10. Sasha wins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, and Anna wins by default because Sasha cannot make a move.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, and it is already greater than or equal to 10^1. Sasha wins by default.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any of the numbers. If she reverses 10 to get 1, Sasha can concatenate numbers but will not be able to get a result greater than or equal to 10^9. Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are 10. Anna can reverse any of them to get 1. Sasha can concatenate 1 and 10 to get 110, and then concatenate 110 and 10 to get 11010, and finally concatenate 11010 and 10 to get 1101010, which is less than 10^5. Anna wins.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
9 1
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse either 9 or 1. If she reverses 1, Sasha can concatenate 1 and 9 to get 19, which is greater than 10^1. If she reverses 9, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 1 to get 91, which is also greater than 10^1. However, since 10^1 is 10, Anna wins because 91 and 19 are both less than 100.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
10 10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Both numbers are 10. Anna can reverse 10 to get 1. Sasha can concatenate 1 and 10 to get 110, which is greater than 10^1. Sasha wins.

# Test 12

10 10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Both numbers are 10. Anna can reverse 10 to get 1. Sasha can concatenate 1 and 10 to get 110, which is greater than 10^2. Sasha wins.

# Test 13
