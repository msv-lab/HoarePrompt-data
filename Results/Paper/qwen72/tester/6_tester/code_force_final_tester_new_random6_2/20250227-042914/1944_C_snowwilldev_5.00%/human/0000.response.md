Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
1
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the basic scenarios where the array sizes are small and the elements are simple to manage. It ensures that the function can handle multiple test cases and that both players play optimally.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains all integers from 0 to n-1. Since Alice and Bob will remove elements in such a way that the MEX of the final array `c` will be 0, this ensures the function handles a complete sequence correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the array does not contain the integer 0. Since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, the MEX will be 0, and both players will play optimally to achieve this.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
7
0 0 1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where there are repeated elements and the array size is slightly larger. It ensures that the function can handle repeated elements and still find the correct MEX.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the array has a gap in the sequence of integers. It ensures that the function can handle gaps and still find the correct MEX.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array has only one element, which is 0. Since Alice will add 0 to `c` and Bob will have no elements to choose from, the MEX of `c` will be 1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array has only one element, which is 1. Since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, the MEX will be 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array has exactly two elements, 0 and 1. Since both elements are present, the MEX will be 2.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array has exactly two elements, 1 and 0, but in reverse order. The MEX will still be 2, ensuring the function is order-independent.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ... 199998 199999
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array size is at the upper limit (200,000). The array contains all integers from 0 to 199,999, ensuring the function can handle large inputs efficiently.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ... 199998 199999
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array size is at the upper limit (200,000) and does not contain the integer 0. The MEX will be 0, ensuring the function can handle large inputs with missing elements.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
200000
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array size is at the upper limit (200,000) and all elements are 0. The MEX will be 1, ensuring the function can handle large inputs with repeated elements.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array size is at the upper limit (200,000) and all elements are 1. The MEX will be 0, ensuring the function can handle large inputs with a single repeated element.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
200000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the array size is at the upper limit (200,000) and contains all integers from 0 to 199,999 with an additional 0 at the end. The MEX will be 1, ensuring the function can handle large inputs with repeated elements at the boundary.
