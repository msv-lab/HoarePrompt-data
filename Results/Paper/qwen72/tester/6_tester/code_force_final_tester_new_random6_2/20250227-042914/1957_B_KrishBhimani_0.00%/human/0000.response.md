Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Scenario**: Single integer `n` and `k` where `n = 1` and `k = 5`. The only possible output is `5`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Scenario**: Two integers `n` and `k` where `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The sequence `1, 2` sums to 3 and has the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
```
**Scenario**: Three integers `n` and `k` where `n = 3` and `k = 6`. The sequence `1, 2, 3` sums to 6 and has the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
```
**Scenario**: Four integers `n` and `k` where `n = 4` and `k = 10`. The sequence `1, 2, 3, 4` sums to 10 and has the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
