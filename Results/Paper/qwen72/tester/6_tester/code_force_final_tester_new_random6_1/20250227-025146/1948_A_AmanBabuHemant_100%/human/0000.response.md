**Scenario**: This test case covers the example provided in the problem description. It checks the function's ability to handle a typical input where `n` is 6, 1, and 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAACC
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 5 special characters. The string "AABBAACC" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 3 special characters. The string "AABBA" has special characters at positions 1, 3, and 5.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAABB
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 4 special characters. The string "AABBAABB" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```

```
YES
AABBAABBCCDD
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 10 special characters. The string "AABBAABBCCDD" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 1. It is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string because a special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, which would imply at least two special characters.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle the maximum value of `n` (50). The string "AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ" has exactly 50 special characters.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 200, which is outside the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should correctly report that there is no such string.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
MM
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 2 special characters. The string "MM" has special characters at positions 1 and 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
51
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 51, which is outside the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should correctly report that there is no such string.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 0, which is outside the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should correctly report that there is no such string.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
50
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle the maximum value of `n` (50) again, but with a different string. The string "AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ" has exactly 50 special characters.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAABBCCDDEE
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 15 special characters. The string "AABBAABBCCDDEE" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.

# Test 14

```
1
25
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTT
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 25 special characters. The string "AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTT" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49.

# Test 15

```
YES
AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's ability to generate a string with exactly 50 special characters. The string "AABBAABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZAA" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70.
