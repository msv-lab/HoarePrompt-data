```
2
0
9
5
11
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic binary strings, including a string that is already sorted, a string with a single 1, and strings with multiple 1s and 0s.

# Test 2

100
01010101
```
**Output**:
```
2
3
8
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings with alternating 0s and 1s, a string with a single 1 at the beginning, and a string with a single 1 at the end.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
111
000
101
11110000
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
3
8
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings with all 1s, all 0s, a string with a single 0 in the middle, and a string with a clear pattern of 1s followed by 0s.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2
0111
1110
```
**Output**:
```
4
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes strings where a single cyclic shift of a specific substring can sort the string.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior with an empty string, which should be handled gracefully (though the problem specifies 2 â‰¤ |s|, it's good to test for edge cases).

```
0
```

**Input**:
```
1
11

```
0
```
