Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, the bets are 27, 41, and 12. The total bet is 80. If the first outcome wins, you get 3 * 27 = 81 coins. If the second outcome wins, you get 2 * 41 = 82 coins. If the third outcome wins, you get 7 * 12 = 84 coins. All these are greater than 80.
- For the second test case, the bets are 1 and 1. The total bet is 2. If either outcome wins, you get 3 * 1 = 3 coins, which is greater than 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
4
4 5 6 7
3
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, the bets are 1, 1, 1, and 1. The total bet is 4. If any outcome wins, you get at least 4 * 1 = 4 coins, which is greater than 4.
- For the second test case, the bets are 1, 1, and 1. The total bet is 3. If any outcome wins, you get at least 2 * 1 = 2 coins, which is greater than 3.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
5
2 3 4 5 6
3
3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, the bets are 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. The total bet is 5. If any outcome wins, you get at least 2 * 1 = 2 coins, which is greater than 5.
- For the second test case, the bets are 1, 1, and 1. The total bet is 3. If any outcome wins, you get at least 3 * 1 = 3 coins, which is greater than 3.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a single outcome with a multiplier of 2, it is impossible to bet a positive amount of coins and still come out ahead because the total bet is equal to the winning amount.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For 50 outcomes, each with a multiplier of 2, it is impossible to bet a positive amount of coins on each outcome and still come out ahead because the total bet will always be equal to the winning amount.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: 
- For 50 outcomes, each with a multiplier of 20, you can bet 1 coin on each outcome. The total bet is 50. If any outcome wins, you get 20 * 1 = 20 coins, which is greater than 50.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

```
**Explanation**: 
- For 50 outcomes with varying multipliers, you can bet 1 coin on each outcome. The total bet is 50. If any outcome wins, you get at least 2 * 1 = 2 coins, which is greater than 50.

2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For 2 outcomes, each with a multiplier of 2, it is impossible to bet a positive amount of coins on each outcome and still come out ahead because the total bet will always be equal to the winning amount.
