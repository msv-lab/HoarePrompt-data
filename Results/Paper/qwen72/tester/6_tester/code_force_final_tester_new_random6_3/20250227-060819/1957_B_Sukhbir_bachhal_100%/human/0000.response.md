Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
1 5
2 3
2 5
6 51
```
**Output**:
```
5
1 2
5 0
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the example provided in the problem description. It includes a single integer, a small sum, a larger sum, and a more complex case with multiple integers.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
1 1
3 6
4 10
```
**Output**:
```
1
2 2 2
2 2 2 4
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a minimal sum, a small number of integers with a moderate sum, and a slightly larger number of integers with a moderate sum. It verifies the basic functionality of the solution.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
2 10
3 15
```
**Output**:
```
5 5
7 7 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a small number of integers with a moderate sum and a slightly larger number of integers with a moderate sum. It checks the ability to distribute the sum across the integers while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior when the sum `k` is at its maximum limit (10^9) and `n` is 1. It ensures the function can handle large sums.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1
```
**Output**:
```
