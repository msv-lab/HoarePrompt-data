It seems there was a slight mix-up in the problem description and the test case format. The problem is about a game between Alice and Bob, and it does not mention a function called `has_close_elements`. I will provide the test cases for the game as described.

### Basic Test Cases

```
10
1 1
1 4
5 3
4 5

83 91
1032 9307
839204 7281
1000000000 1000000000
53110 2024
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob
Bob
Alice
Alice
Bob
Bob
```

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
2 2
3 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
Alice
Bob
```

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
5 5
6 4
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
Alice
```

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2
10 1
1 10
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
Bob
```

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
7 7
8 6
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
Alice
```

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the minimum number of coins (1). Alice cannot make a move after the first turn, so Bob wins.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins. Alice can swap and then Bob will be forced to remove a coin, leaving Alice to win.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin. Alice can remove a coin, but then Bob will be forced to remove his last coin, and Alice will win in the next turn.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and Bob with 1 coin. Alice can swap and force Bob to lose immediately.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000). Bob can force Alice to lose immediately.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000). The game will end in a draw, but since Bob can force Alice to make the first move, Bob wins.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and Bob with one less. Alice can swap and force Bob to lose eventually.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
999999999 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with one less than the maximum number of coins (999,999,999) and Bob with the maximum. Bob can force Alice to lose eventually.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with 2 coins. Alice cannot force a win, so Bob wins.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with 3 coins. Alice cannot force a win, so Bob wins.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and Bob with 2 coins. Alice can swap and force Bob to lose immediately.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000). Bob can force Alice to lose immediately.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and Bob with 3 coins. Alice can swap and force Bob to lose eventually.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
3 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 3 coins and Bob with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000). Bob can force Alice to lose eventually.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000). The game will end in a draw, but since Bob can force Alice to make the first move, Bob wins.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, to ensure the solution is robust and handles all possible inputs correctly.
