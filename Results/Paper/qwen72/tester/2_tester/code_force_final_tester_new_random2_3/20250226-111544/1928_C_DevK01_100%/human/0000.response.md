```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a large input where Vasya received a number that is half of the position, which should have exactly one valid k value.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid input where Vasya's position is equal to the number, which should have no valid k values.

**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 999999998
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
