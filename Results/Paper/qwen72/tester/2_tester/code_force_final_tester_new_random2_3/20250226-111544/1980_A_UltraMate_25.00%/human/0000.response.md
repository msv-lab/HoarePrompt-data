### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
A
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the minimum possible input for `n` and `m`, where only one problem is available, and it is of difficulty 'A'. This ensures the function can handle the smallest possible input.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
5 5
AAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has only one type of problem and the number of rounds is the maximum. This ensures the function can handle a highly unbalanced problem bank.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
AABBBCC
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has multiple problems of the same difficulty level but is still short of the required number of problems.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
GGGGGGG
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has only one type of problem, and it is of the highest difficulty level. This ensures the function can handle a problem bank with only the highest difficulty problems.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
AABBBCC
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has multiple problems of the same difficulty level but is still short of the required number of problems.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
15 1
AABBBCCDDEEFFG
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has exactly the required number of problems for one round. This ensures the function can handle a perfectly balanced problem bank.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 5
A
```
**Output**:
```
30
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has only one problem of the lowest difficulty level, and the number of rounds is the maximum. This ensures the function can handle a highly unbalanced problem bank with the minimum number of problems.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
7 5
AABBBCC
```
**Output**:
```
25
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the problem bank has multiple problems of the same difficulty level but is still short of the required number of problems for multiple rounds.
