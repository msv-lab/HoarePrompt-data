### Note:
- Test cases 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20 are included to test the function's behavior with strings that exceed the problem's constraints. These cases are not required by the problem but can help identify potential issues with string length handling.
- Test cases 1-9 are within the problem's constraints and should be the primary focus for ensuring the function works correctly.
