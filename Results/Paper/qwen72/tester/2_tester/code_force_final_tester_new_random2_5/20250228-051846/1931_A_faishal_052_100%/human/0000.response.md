**Scenario**: Near maximum encoded value, testing the boundary condition just below the maximum.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
6
```
**Output**:
```
aaa
```
**Scenario**: Minimum encoded value that is not the smallest possible, testing the boundary condition just above the minimum.

# Test 10
**Input**:

```
**Scenario**: Testing the maximum possible sum, which should result in the word "zzz".

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
39
```
**Output**:
```
azz
```
**Scenario**: Testing a value that is the sum of the largest index and two smallest indices, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
52
```
**Output**:
```
azz
```
**Scenario**: Testing a value that can be formed by multiple combinations, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
76
```
**Output**:
```
rzx
```
**Scenario**: Testing a value that is one less than the maximum possible sum, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
aab
```
**Scenario**: Testing a small value that is not the minimum, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
aac
```
**Scenario**: Testing another small value, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
74
```
**Output**:
```
ryy
```
**Scenario**: Testing a value that is two less than the maximum possible sum, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
73
```
**Output**:
```
ryx
```
**Scenario**: Testing a value that is three less than the maximum possible sum, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
