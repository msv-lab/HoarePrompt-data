### Explanation of Test Cases

- **Test 1**: Covers a variety of string lengths and compositions, including a string with all unique characters and strings with repeated characters.
- **Test 2**: Tests strings of different lengths, including the shortest possible string that can be rearranged.
- **Test 3**: Tests common words to ensure the function handles typical inputs correctly.
- **Test 4**: Tests strings that are commonly used in programming contexts.
- **Test 5**: Tests the same string multiple times to ensure the function can handle identical inputs.
- **Test 6**: Tests the edge case of a single-character string, which cannot be rearranged.
- **Test 7**: Tests the edge case of a two-character string with identical characters, which cannot be rearranged.
- **Test 8**: Tests the edge case of a three-character string with all unique characters, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 9**: Tests the edge case of a string with all identical characters, which cannot be rearranged.
- **Test 10**: Tests a string with alternating characters, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 11**: Tests a string with a mix of characters, including repeated ones, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 12**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 13**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 14**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 15**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 16**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 17**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 18**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 19**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.
- **Test 20**: Tests a string with repeated characters and a pattern, which can be rearranged.

These test cases should help ensure that the function is robust, reliable, and scalable.
