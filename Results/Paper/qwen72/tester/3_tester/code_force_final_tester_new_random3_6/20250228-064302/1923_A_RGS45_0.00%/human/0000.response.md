```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with only one chip. The function should return 0 as no moves are needed.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
49
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with a single chip at the far right. The function should return 49 as the chip needs to be moved to the leftmost position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```

50
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with a single chip at the far left. The function should return 0 as no moves are needed.

# Test 8
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
24
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with chips and free cells alternating. The function should return 24 as each chip needs to be moved to the left to form a single block.
