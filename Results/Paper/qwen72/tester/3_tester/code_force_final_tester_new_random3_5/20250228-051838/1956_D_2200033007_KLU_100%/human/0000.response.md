Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {0, 1} is 2. By setting a_1 and a_2 to 2, the array becomes [2, 2] with a sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**:
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum of the elements is 13, and no operation can increase this sum further.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: 
- After the first operation (l=3, r=3), the array becomes [1, 100, 0, 1].
- After the second operation (l=3, r=4), the array becomes [1, 100, 2, 2].
- The final sum is 105.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {0} is 1. By setting a_1 to 1, the array becomes [1] with a sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
25 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is 5. By setting a_1 to a_5 to 5, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] with a sum of 25.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 17} is 18. By setting all elements to 18, the array becomes [18, 18, ..., 18] with a sum of 306.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
18
18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18
```
**Output**:
```
324 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum of the elements is 324, and no operation can increase this sum further.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: This is a large array where the MEX is 18. Setting all elements to 18 results in the maximum sum of 306.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 18} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0, but this is not the optimal solution. The correct MEX to use is 18, resulting in a sum of 306.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
324 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the set {0, 0, ..., 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 18. However, the optimal MEX to use is 18, resulting in a sum of 324.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
180000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum of the elements is 180000000, and no operation can increase this sum further.
