Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: In this case, the array is already in increasing order. The optimal split is `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
5
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
5
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
5
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is in decreasing order, so the optimal split is `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
5
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
5
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is in strictly decreasing order, so the optimal split is `s = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

**Input**:
```
5
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The array is in strictly increasing order, so the optimal split is `s = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 8 + 1 = 9`.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
5
20
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The array has a strictly increasing part followed by a strictly decreasing part. The optimal split is `s = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and `t = [1, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 8 + 1 = 9`.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
5
10
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
5
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array has a strictly increasing part followed by a strictly decreasing part with some repeated elements. The optimal split is `s = [2, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 3 + 1 = 4`.

# Test 12
**Input**:
