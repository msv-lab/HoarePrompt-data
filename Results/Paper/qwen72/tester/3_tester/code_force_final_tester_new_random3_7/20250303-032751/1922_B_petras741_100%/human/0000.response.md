Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem. Each test case is designed to cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Scenario**: All sticks have the same length. Any three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Multiple sticks with different lengths. Only two valid combinations of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Three sticks with lengths that cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Only one stick is given, which is not enough to form a triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Five sticks with lengths that cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
120
```
**Scenario**: Large number of sticks with the same length. Any three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 7
