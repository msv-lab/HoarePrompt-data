Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 1]. The MEX of the entire array is 2. By setting both elements to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the sum is 4.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**:
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1, 3, 9]. The MEX of the entire array is 0, but since 0 is not present in the array, no operation can increase the sum. The initial sum is 13, which is the maximum possible.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: 
1. The initial array is [1, 100, 2, 1]. The MEX of the subarray [2] is 0. By setting a_3 to 0, the array becomes [1, 100, 0, 1].
2. The MEX of the subarray [0, 1] is 2. By setting a_3 and a_4 to 2, the array becomes [1, 100, 2, 2]. The sum is 105.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0]. The MEX of the entire array is 1. By setting the only element to 1, the array becomes [1], and the sum is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 0, 0]. The MEX of the entire array is 1. By setting all elements to 1, the array becomes [1, 1, 1], and the sum is 3.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The MEX of the entire array is 18. By setting all elements to 18, the array becomes [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18], and the sum is 306.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
18
18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The MEX of the entire array is 0. By setting all elements to 0, the array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. However, the sum is maximized by setting all elements to 18, which is the MEX of the initial array.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The MEX of the entire array is 0. By setting all elements to 0, the array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. However, the sum is maximized by setting all elements to 18, which is the MEX of the initial array.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
306 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The MEX of the entire array is 1. By setting all elements to 1, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the sum is 18. However, the sum is maximized by setting all elements to 18, which is the MEX of the initial array.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
180000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000]. The MEX of the entire array is 0, but since 0 is not present in the array, no operation can increase the sum. The initial sum is 180000000, which is the maximum possible.
