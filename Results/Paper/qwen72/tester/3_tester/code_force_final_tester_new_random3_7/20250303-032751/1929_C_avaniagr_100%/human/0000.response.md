It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function `has_close_elements` mentioned in the test case instructions. The problem is about determining whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins in a casino with specific rules, not about checking for close elements in a list. I will provide test cases that are relevant to the casino problem as described.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1 7
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a simple setup where Sasha can or cannot guarantee winning any number of coins based on his initial coins and the casino rules.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
2 3 15
3 3 6
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case evaluates different combinations of `k`, `x`, and `a` to see if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. It includes a mix of scenarios where he can and cannot achieve his goal.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
5 4 7
2 2 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks scenarios where the multiplier `k` is higher, and the initial coins `a` are moderate, to ensure the code handles these cases correctly.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has only 1 coin initially and the maximum number of consecutive losses is very high. This should result in a "NO" because he cannot bet more than 1 coin and thus cannot recover from a single loss.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the multiplier `k` is at its maximum value, and Sasha has a large number of initial coins. This should result in a "YES" because the high multiplier allows him to recover quickly from losses.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a very large number of initial coins and can only lose once in a row. This should result in a "YES" because he can always recover from a single loss with a large initial amount.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a very large number of initial coins but can lose a large number of times in a row. This should result in a "NO" because the high number of consecutive losses can deplete his coins before he can recover.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a small number of initial coins and can only lose a small number of times in a row. This should result in a "YES" because he can recover from a few losses with a small initial amount.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a slightly larger number of initial coins and can only lose a small number of times in a row. This should result in a "YES" because he can recover from a few losses with a small initial amount.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a moderate number of initial coins but can lose a large number of times in a row. This should result in a "NO" because the high number of consecutive losses can deplete his coins before he can recover.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the multiplier `k` is high, but the number of consecutive losses `x` is also high, and the initial coins `a` are moderate. This should result in a "NO" because the high number of consecutive losses can deplete his coins before he can recover.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the multiplier `k` is moderate, the number of consecutive losses `x` is very high, and the initial coins `a` are large. This should result in a "NO" because the high number of consecutive losses can deplete his coins before he can recover.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has only 1 coin initially and can only lose 2 times in a row. This should result in a "NO" because he cannot bet more than 1 coin and thus cannot recover from a single loss.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has 2 coins initially and can only lose once in a row. This should result in a "YES" because he can always recover from a single loss with 2 initial coins.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Sasha has a very large number of initial coins but can lose a large number of times in a row. This should result in a "NO" because the high number of consecutive losses can deplete his coins before he can recover.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, to ensure the code is robust and handles all possible inputs correctly.
