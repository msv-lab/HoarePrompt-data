Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- For each test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top `n` times, resulting in a tower with `n` cubes.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2
2 3
```

No
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, Nikita can only end up with 0 or 1 cube, not 2.
- For the second test case, Nikita can only end up with 0, 1, or 2 cubes, not 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
5 1
6 2
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top 5 times and remove 4 cubes, resulting in a tower with 1 cube.
- For the second test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top 6 times and remove 4 cubes, resulting in a tower with 2 cubes.
- For the third test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top 7 times and remove 4 cubes, resulting in a tower with 3 cubes.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can only perform 1 move, so the maximum number of cubes he can have is 1. He cannot end up with 100 cubes.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can put 1 cube on top 100 times and remove 99 cubes, resulting in a tower with 1 cube.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can put 1 cube on top 100 times, resulting in a tower with 100 cubes.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can put 1 cube on top, resulting in a tower with 1 cube.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can put 1 cube on top and then remove 1 cube, resulting in a tower with 1 cube.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can put 1 cube on top 50 times and remove 0 cubes, resulting in a tower with 50 cubes.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
50 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can only perform 50 moves, so the maximum number of cubes he can have is 50. He cannot end up with 100 cubes.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100 101
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can only perform 100 moves, so the maximum number of cubes he can have is 100. He cannot end up with 101 cubes.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can remove 1 cube 100 times, resulting in a tower with 0 cubes.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can remove 1 cube once, resulting in a tower with 0 cubes.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- Nikita can remove 1 cube twice, resulting in a tower with 0 cubes.
