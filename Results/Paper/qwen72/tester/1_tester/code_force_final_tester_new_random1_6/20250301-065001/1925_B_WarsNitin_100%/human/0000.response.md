**Scenario**: This test case includes a variety of inputs to further verify the function's ability to handle different combinations of `x` and `n`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
3
1 1
2 1
3 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 1. The maximum balance should always be equal to `x` in this case.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
3
1 2
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is greater than `x` and `x` is a small positive integer. The maximum balance should always be 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 100000000
100000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
100000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the maximum possible values for `x` and `n`. It ensures the function can handle large inputs efficiently.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
2
10 10
20 20
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `x` and `n` are equal. The maximum balance should always be 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2
10 2
15 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `x` is divisible by `n`. The maximum balance should be `x / n` because each sub-problem can have difficulty `x / n`.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
2
10 1
100 1
```
**Output**:
```
10
100
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is 1. The maximum balance should always be equal to `x` in this case.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
2
100 2
1000 10
```
**Output**:
```
50
100
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with larger values of `x` and `n` where `x` is not necessarily divisible by `n`. It ensures the function can handle such cases and compute the correct maximum balance.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 2
100000000 10
```
**Output**:
```
50000000
10000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with very large values of `x` and `n` where `x` is divisible by `n`. It ensures the function can handle such large inputs and compute the correct maximum balance.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 100000001
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior when `n` is just slightly greater than `x`. The maximum balance should always be 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 2
100000000 50000000
```
**Output**:
```
50000000
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with very large values of `x` and `n` where `x` is not divisible by `n`. It ensures the function can handle such cases and compute the correct maximum balance.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 100000000
100000000 99999999
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with very large values of `x` and `n` where `n` is very close to `x`. The maximum balance should always be 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
2
100000000 100000000
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the maximum possible values for `x` and `n` repeated. It ensures the function can handle such large inputs efficiently and consistently.

These test cases should help thoroughly evaluate the function's performance and correctness across a wide range of scenarios.
