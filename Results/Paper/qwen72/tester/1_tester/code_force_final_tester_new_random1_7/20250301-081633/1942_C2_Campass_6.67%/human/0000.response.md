It seems there's a bit of a mix-up in the problem description and the test case format you're asking for. The problem is about maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon, not about checking for close elements in a function. I'll provide the test cases for the problem described, focusing on both basic and edge scenarios.
