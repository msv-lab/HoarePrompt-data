200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at the last node. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins. This tests the function's scalability.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at the middle node. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins. This tests the function's performance with a large, balanced starting position.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 10 nodes and the stone starting at the first node. Ron can move to the next node, and Hermione will be forced to move to the next, and so on, leaving Ron with the last move.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
10
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 10 nodes and the stone starting at the last node. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
100 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99 100
50
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with 100 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins. This tests the function's performance with a medium-sized, balanced starting position.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at the last node. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins. This tests the function's performance with the maximum number of nodes and a starting position at the end.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at the first node. Ron can move to the next node, and Hermione will be forced to move to the next, and so on, leaving Ron with the last move. This tests the function's performance with the maximum number of nodes and a starting position at the beginning.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100001
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: A linear tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at a node slightly past the middle. Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins. This tests the function's performance with a large, slightly unbalanced starting position.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including small and large trees, different starting positions, and edge cases to ensure the code is robust and reliable.
