#### Test 4: Moderate Values
**Input**:
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Note**: This case tests a moderate range of values. The valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), and (10, 2).

#### Test 5: Larger Values
**Input**:
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**:
```
153
```
**Note**: This case tests a larger range of values to ensure the function can handle more extensive inputs.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: Maximum Values for `n` and `m`
**Input**:
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
[Expected output based on the problem constraints]
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with the maximum possible values for `n` and `m` to ensure it can handle large inputs efficiently.

#### Test 7: Maximum Number of Test Cases
**Input**:
```
10000
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
9 9
10 10
...
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
3
5
8
10
14
16
20
23
27
...
[Expected outputs for all 10,000 test cases]
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with the maximum number of test cases (10,000) to ensure it can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

#### Test 8: Minimum Values for `n` and `m`
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with the minimum possible values for `n` and `m` to ensure it handles small inputs correctly.

#### Test 9: One of the Values is 1
**Input**:
```
2
1 2000000
2000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2000000
2000000
```
**Note**: This case tests the function when one of the values is 1. Since any number plus 1 is always a multiple of 1, all pairs (1, b) and (a, 1) are valid.

#### Test 10: Values with a Large Difference
**Input**:
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
2000000
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with a large difference between `n` and `m`. Since `n` is 1, all pairs (1, b) are valid.

#### Test 11: Values with a Small Difference
**Input**:
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with a small difference between `n` and `m` to ensure it handles such cases correctly.

#### Test 12: Values with a Large GCD
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**:
```
[Expected output based on the problem constraints]
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with large values where the GCD of `a` and `b` can be significant to ensure it handles large GCDs correctly.

#### Test 13: Values with a Small GCD
**Input**:
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with small values where the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1 to ensure it handles small GCDs correctly.

#### Test 14: Values with a Prime Number
**Input**:
```
1
2000003 2000003
```
**Output**:
```
[Expected output based on the problem constraints]
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with a prime number to ensure it handles prime numbers correctly.

#### Test 15: Values with a Composite Number
**Input**:
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
[Expected output based on the problem constraints]
```
**Note**: This case tests the function with a composite number to ensure it handles composite numbers correctly.

#### Test 16: Values with a Large Number of Test Cases and Varying Inputs
**Input**:
```
10
1 1
2 3
3 5
10 8
100 1233
1000000 1145141
2000000 1
