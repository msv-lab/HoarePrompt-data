1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
4
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 6 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Ron can move to either the third or fifth node, and Hermione will be forced into a losing position.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the minimum number of nodes (2). The stone starts at one of the leaves, and Hermione wins by default as Ron cannot make a move.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
100000
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at the middle node. This tests the scalability and performance of the solution.

# Test 7

4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
1
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 10 nodes and the stone starting at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by mirroring Ron's moves.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
5
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 10 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Ron can move to either the fourth or sixth node, and Hermione will be forced into a losing position.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
7 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 7 nodes and the stone starting at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by mirroring Ron's moves.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
7 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
4
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 7 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Ron can move to either the third or fifth node, and Hermione will be forced into a losing position.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
100 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99 100
50
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 100 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. This tests the solution's ability to handle a larger but manageable number of nodes.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
100 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99 100
100
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 100 nodes and the stone starting at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by mirroring Ron's moves.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
999 1000
500
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 1000 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. This tests the solution's ability to handle a significantly larger number of nodes.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
999 1000
1000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Linear tree with 1000 nodes and the stone starting at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by mirroring Ron's moves.

```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**:
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000) and the stone starting at one of the leaves. This tests the solution's ability to handle the maximum input size and performance under extreme conditions.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including small and large trees, starting positions at the middle and leaves, and edge cases with the minimum and maximum number of nodes. They are designed to ensure the code is thoroughly tested for correctness and performance.
