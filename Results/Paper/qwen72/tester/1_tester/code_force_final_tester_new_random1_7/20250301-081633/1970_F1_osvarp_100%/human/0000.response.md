It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the test case format. The problem is about simulating a Quidditch game and tracking the score, not about a `has_close_elements` function. I will provide comprehensive test cases for the Quidditch game simulation problem.

### Basic Test Cases

R0 T
```
**Output**:
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```
**Scenario**: Basic game where both teams score once. The blue team scores first, followed by the red team.
