Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This is a straightforward case where the operation can be applied multiple times to make all elements zero.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This case demonstrates a scenario where it is impossible to make all elements zero.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This case starts with some elements already zero and checks if the remaining elements can be made zero.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
5 6 0 2 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This case includes zeros in the middle of the array, making it impossible to balance the elements to zero.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 7 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This case has a large middle element that cannot be balanced by the operations.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
7 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible array size (n=3) with a large first element that cannot be balanced.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This case has all elements equal, but the operation cannot be applied to make them all zero.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This case has all elements already zero, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible array with all elements already zero.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible array with all elements equal to 1, which cannot be made zero.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible array with all elements equal to 2, which cannot be made zero.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
