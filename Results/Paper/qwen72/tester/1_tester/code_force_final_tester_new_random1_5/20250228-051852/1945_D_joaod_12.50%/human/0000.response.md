Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem. Each test case is designed to cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move to position 2 by paying 7 coins to the person at position 1 and 3 coins to the person at position 2. Total cost = 7 + 3 = 10. Alternatively, he can move to position 3 by paying 7 coins to the person at position 1, 3 coins to the person at position 2, and 6 coins to the person at position 3. Total cost = 7 + 3 + 6 = 16. The minimum cost is 14.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
22
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move to position 2 by paying 6 coins to the person at position 1, 9 coins to the person at position 2, and 7 coins to the person at position 3. Total cost = 6 + 9 + 7 = 22. This is the minimum cost to be among the first 2 people.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can stay in his original position (7) without moving, as he is already among the first 7 people. The cost is 0. However, if he moves to position 6, he will pay 9 coins to the person at position 6. The minimum cost is 9.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move to position 1 by paying 2 coins to the person at position 1. The minimum cost is 3.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:

1 1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can only move to the first position, which costs 1 coin.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```

1 2 3 ... 200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move to the first position, which will cost him 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 200000 coins. The sum of the first 200000 natural numbers is 200000 * 200001 / 2 = 20000100000.

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
55
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move to the first position, which will cost him 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 coins.
