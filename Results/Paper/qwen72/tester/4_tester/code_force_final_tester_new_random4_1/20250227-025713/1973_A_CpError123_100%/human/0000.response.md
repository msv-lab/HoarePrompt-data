3
0 2 2
2 2 4
4 4 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
4

```
**Scenario**: This test case checks scenarios where the scores are even and can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 2
0 2 4
2 4 6
```
**Output**:
```
1
3
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks scenarios where the scores are even and can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws, but with one player having zero points.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 4
0 0 6
0 0 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
3
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks scenarios where one player has zero points and the other two have even scores, which can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where one player has 1 point and the other two have 0 points, which is impossible.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where the scores are 0, 1, and 2, which is impossible because the score difference is too large for a single game.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 30
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible score for one player with the other two having zero points, which can only be achieved with 15 wins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible score for all players being the same, which can only be achieved with 15 draws.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 29
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where one player has 29 points and the other two have 0 points, which is impossible because 29 is an odd number and cannot be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 30
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where two players have 1 point each and one player has 30 points, which is impossible because the score difference is too large.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
0 2 30
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where one player has 0 points, one player has 2 points, and one player has 30 points, which is impossible because the score difference is too large.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 15
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where one player has 15 points and the other two have 0 points, which can be achieved with 7 draws and 1 win.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
15 15 15
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where all players have 15 points, which can only be achieved with 15 draws.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
0 15 30
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where one player has 0 points, one player has 15 points, and one player has 30 points, which can be achieved with 15 draws and 15 wins.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 29
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where two players have 1 point each and one player has 29 points, which is impossible because the score difference is too large.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an invalid scenario where the scores are 1, 2, and 3, which is impossible because the score difference is too large for a single game.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a valid scenario where the scores are 1, 1, and 3, which can be achieved with one draw and one win.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 28
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where one player has 28 points and the other two have 0 points, which can be achieved with 14 draws and 1 win.
