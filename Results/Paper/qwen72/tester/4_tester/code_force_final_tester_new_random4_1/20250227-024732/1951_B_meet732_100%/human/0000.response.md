```
1
7 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Minimum number of cows (n = 2). Cow k is in the first position but has the lowest rating, so it cannot win any matches.

**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of cows (n = 100000). Cow k is in the last position with the highest rating, so it can win all matches without any swap.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
100000 99999 99998 99997 ... 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of cows (n = 100000). Cow k is in the first position with the highest rating, but it will lose to the second cow because the second cow has the next highest rating.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
49999
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of cows (n = 100000). Cow k is in the middle position with a moderate rating. The optimal swap is to position 49999, allowing the cow to win 49999 matches.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
100000 99999 99998 99997 ... 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
49999
```
**Scenario**: Maximum number of cows (n = 100000). Cow k is in the middle position with a moderate rating. The optimal swap is to position 50000, allowing the cow to win 49999 matches.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
100 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Small number of cows (n = 3). Cow k is in the second position with a low rating. The optimal swap is to position 1, allowing the cow to win one match.

3 3
10 1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Small number of cows (n = 3). Cow k is in the last position with the highest rating, but it will lose to the first cow because the first cow has the next highest rating.
