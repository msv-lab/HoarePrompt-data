# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 3 4 1 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 5 friends where some friends form a small cycle (1, 2, 3, 4) and one friend (5) is not part of the cycle. It tests the scenario where the group has both cyclic and non-cyclic relationships.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 3 1 5 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 5 friends where there are two separate cycles (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5). It tests the scenario where the group has multiple disjoint cycles.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 4 friends where each friend is paired with another friend (1-2 and 3-4). It tests the scenario where the group has multiple pairs of best friends.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 3 friends forming a single cycle. It tests the scenario where the group size is just above the minimum and all friends are interconnected in a cycle.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 1 4 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 5 friends where there are two pairs (1-2 and 4-5) and one friend (3) who is the best friend of one of the pairs. It tests the scenario where the group has a mix of pairs and a single friend.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 3 1 5 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 5 friends where there are two cycles (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5). It tests the scenario where the group has multiple disjoint cycles of different sizes.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 3 4 1 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a group of 5 friends where there is a cycle (1, 2, 3, 4) and one friend (5) who is not part of the cycle. It tests the scenario where the group has a large cycle and a single friend.
