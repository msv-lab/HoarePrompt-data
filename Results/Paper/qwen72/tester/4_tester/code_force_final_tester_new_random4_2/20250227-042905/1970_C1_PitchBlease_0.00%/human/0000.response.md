199999 200000
100001
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with the maximum possible tree size (200,000 nodes) and the stone starting at a node close to the middle. Ron can move to one of the leaves, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
