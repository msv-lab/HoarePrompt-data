```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function for the smallest number of islands (2) with `k` set to 1. It ensures that destroying one bridge isolates Everule from the other island.

# Test 11

50 1224
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function for a medium number of islands (50) with `k` set to 1224. It ensures that destroying almost all bridges leaves Everule with the minimum number of reachable islands.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
50 0
```
**Output**:
```
50
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function for a medium number of islands (50) with `k` set to 0. It ensures that no bridges being destroyed allows Everule to visit all islands.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
50 1
```
**Output**:
```
50
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function for a medium number of islands (50) with `k` set to 1. It ensures that destroying one bridge does not isolate Everule from all other islands.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
10 45
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function for a smaller number of islands (10) with `k` set to the maximum possible value (45, which is \(\frac{10 \cdot 9}{2}\)). It ensures the function correctly isolates Everule when all bridges are destroyed.
