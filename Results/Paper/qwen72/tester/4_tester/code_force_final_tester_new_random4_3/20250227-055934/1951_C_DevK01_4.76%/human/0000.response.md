It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function name. The problem is about minimizing the cost to purchase a certain number of concert tickets over a series of days with specific constraints, not about a function called `has_close_elements`. I will provide test cases for the concert ticket problem as described.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the number of tickets to buy is less than the maximum tickets that can be bought in a single day. The optimal strategy is to buy all tickets on the cheapest day.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 4
10 20 30 40
```
**Output**: 
```
60
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the number of tickets to buy is exactly the maximum tickets that can be bought over two days. The optimal strategy is to buy 2 tickets on the two cheapest days.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
100 200 300
```
**Output**: 
```
600
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1, and the total tickets to buy is 3. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 10
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Scenario**: Basic case where the prices are the same every day, and the number of tickets to buy is 10. The optimal strategy is to buy 2 tickets each day for 5 days.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where there is only one day to buy tickets, and the number of tickets to buy is 1. The maximum tickets that can be bought per day is very high, but only 1 ticket is needed.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1 100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
5050
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large number of days (100,000), but only 1 ticket can be bought per day, and the total tickets to buy is 100,000. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where there is only one day to buy tickets, and the price is the maximum possible value (1,000,000,000). Only 1 ticket is needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1000000000 3000000000
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is very large (3,000,000,000), and the prices are the minimum possible value (1) for all days. The maximum tickets that can be bought per day is very high.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 999999996 999999995 999999994 999999993 999999992 999999991
```
**Output**: 
```
9999999955
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large number of days and very high prices, but only 1 ticket can be bought per day. The total tickets to buy is equal to the number of days.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Scenario**: Edge case where the number of tickets to buy is equal to the number of days, and the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is also 10. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket each day.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
