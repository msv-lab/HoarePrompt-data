The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take the values from 0 to t-1 as the loop iterates.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The placeholder `_` does not need an initial state adjustment since it is not used before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder that will take values from 0 to t-1 as the loop iterates**
