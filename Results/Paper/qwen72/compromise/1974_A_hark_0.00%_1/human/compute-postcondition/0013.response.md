The given `print` statement is `print(0)`. This statement will print the integer `0` regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.

Based on the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input.
- Either `x` is 0 or `y` is not 0.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `x` or `y`, the output will always be the same.

Output: **0**
