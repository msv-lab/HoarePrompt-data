Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- The range for both `x` and `y` is 0 to 99.
- `x` is assigned the value 0.
- `y` is assigned a value greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `y`**: According to the initial state, `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99. Therefore, \( 0 < y \leq 99 \).
2. **Expression `y / 2`**: This expression divides `y` by 2. Since `y` is a positive integer, the result of `y / 2` will be a positive number, which could be an integer or a float depending on whether `y` is even or odd.
3. **Function `math.ceil(y / 2)`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer. If `y` is even, `y / 2` is already an integer, and `math.ceil` will return that integer. If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a float, and `math.ceil` will round it up to the next integer.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Since `y` is a positive integer and its exact value is not specified, the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a positive integer between 1 and 99)**
