Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 3`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
