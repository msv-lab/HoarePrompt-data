The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 500, and each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n - 1`.

The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`. Each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is set to 1000000000.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is 1000000000.**
