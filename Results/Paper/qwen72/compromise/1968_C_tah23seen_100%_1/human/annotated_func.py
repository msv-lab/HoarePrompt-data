#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except for the elements from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` which are now calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and `i` is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is 1000000000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is 1000000000. The input list `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
