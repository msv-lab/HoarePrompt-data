Output State: **`i` is the length of `l`, `k` is the third integer in `b`, `t` is greater than the length of `l`, `b` is a list of integers derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace, `o` is a list of strings derived from the input split by whitespace, `n` is the first integer in `b`, `f` is the second integer in `b`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
