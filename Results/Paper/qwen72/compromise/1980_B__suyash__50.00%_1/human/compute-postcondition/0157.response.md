The given `print` statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `i` is 1.
  - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements.
  - `k` is now `k - dic[l[1]]`, where `dic` is a dictionary and `l[1]` is the second element of the list `l`.

- **What is printed:**
  - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
