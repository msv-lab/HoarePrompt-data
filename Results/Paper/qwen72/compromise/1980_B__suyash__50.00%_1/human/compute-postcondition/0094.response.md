Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`. If `k` < 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
