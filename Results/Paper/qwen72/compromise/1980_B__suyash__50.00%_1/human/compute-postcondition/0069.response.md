Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is set to `t`.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new input `a` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input.
   - `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`.
   - `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`.
   - `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`.
   - `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `o`.
   - `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order.
   - `a` is the new input string.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
