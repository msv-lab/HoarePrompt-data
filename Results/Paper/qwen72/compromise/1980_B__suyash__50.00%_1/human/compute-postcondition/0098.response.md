Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
