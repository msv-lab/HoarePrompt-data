Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, and the current value of `l[i]` is not equal to `fav`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.***
