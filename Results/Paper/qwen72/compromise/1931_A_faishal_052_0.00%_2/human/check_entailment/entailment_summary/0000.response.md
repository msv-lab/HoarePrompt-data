Reasoning:  
The program aims to decode a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into a 3-letter word that is lexicographically smallest. The approach taken by the program is to repeatedly subtract the largest possible value (26) from `n` and append the corresponding letter index to a list `arr`. After processing, the list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order, and the characters are printed.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**: The program subtracts 26 from `lex` multiple times without ensuring that the remaining value is correctly handled. This can lead to incorrect results if `lex` is not a multiple of 26.
2. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**: The logic for appending 1 or 26 to `arr` is flawed. It should be more systematic to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The goal is to find the smallest lexicographical word, which means the characters should be placed in a specific order, not just sorted.

To correctly decode the word, the program should:
- Start by placing the smallest possible values in the first two positions.
- Ensure the sum of the three values equals `n`.
- Place the remaining value in the third position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the array to store the letter indices
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Place the smallest possible values in the first two positions
        arr[0] = 1
        arr[1] = 1
        arr[2] = n - 2  # Initial value for the third position
        
        # Adjust the values to ensure they are within the valid range (1-26)
        while arr[2] > 26:
            arr[2] -= 25
            arr[1] += 1
        
        while arr[1] > 26:
            arr[1] -= 25
            arr[0] += 1
        
        # Convert the indices to characters and print the result
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

Explanation:
- We initialize `arr` with `[0, 0, 0]` and set the first two positions to 1 (the smallest possible value).
- We set the third position to `n - 2` to account for the initial values of the first two positions.
- We then adjust the values in `arr` to ensure they are within the valid range (1-26) by repeatedly subtracting 25 from the current position and adding 1 to the previous position.
- Finally, we convert the indices to characters and print the result.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
