Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**:
   - The program subtracts 26 from `lex` multiple times, which can lead to incorrect values being appended to `arr`. For example, if `lex` is 70, the program will append 26, 26, and 18, but the correct lexicographically smallest word for 70 is "rzz" (26 + 26 + 18).

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` does not guarantee that the resulting word will be lexicographically smallest. For example, if `lex` is 48, the program will append 26, 26, and 2, then sort the array to [2, 26, 26], which results in "azz" instead of "auz".

3. **Incorrect Logic for Smallest Lexicographical Word**:
   - The program should aim to minimize the first character, then the second, and finally the third. This can be achieved by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value (26) from `lex` and appending the corresponding character.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = []
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 26:
                word.append(26)
                lex -= 26
            else:
                word.append(lex)
                lex = 0
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(word[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the encoded value `lex`.

2. **Generate the Word**:
   - Initialize an empty list `word` to store the indices of the characters.
   - For each of the 3 characters in the word:
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, append 26 to `word` and subtract 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, append the remaining value of `lex` to `word` and set `lex` to 0.

3. **Output the Word**:
   - Convert the indices in `word` to characters using `chr(index + 96)`.
   - Print the characters in the correct order.

This corrected program will generate the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value.
