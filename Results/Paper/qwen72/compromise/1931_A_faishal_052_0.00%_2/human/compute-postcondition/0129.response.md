Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 1.
- `arr` is a sorted list that contains:
  - `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26.
  - `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51.
  - `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52.
- `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]`**:
   - `k` is 1.
   - The value of `arr[1]` depends on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, so `arr[1]` is 1.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`, so `arr[1]` is 26.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`, so `arr[1]` is 26.

2. **Calculate `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - `arr[1] + 96` will be:
     - `1 + 96 = 97` if `lex` is less than or equal to 26.
     - `26 + 96 = 122` if `lex` is between 27 and 51 or greater than or equal to 52.

3. **Determine the output**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `chr(97)` is `'a'`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 or greater than or equal to 52, `chr(122)` is `'z'`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` statement will print either `'a'` or `'z'` depending on the value of `lex`.
- Since `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, the most precise description based on the precondition is:

Output: **'a' (if `lex` is less than or equal to 26) or 'z' (if `lex` is between 27 and 51 or greater than or equal to 52)**
