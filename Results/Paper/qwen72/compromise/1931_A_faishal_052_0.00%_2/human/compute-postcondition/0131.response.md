Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `arr` is a sorted list that contains:
  - `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26.
  - `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51.
  - `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52.
- `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]`**:
   - Since `k` is 2, we need to look at the third element of the list `arr`.
   - The value of `arr[2]` depends on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, so `arr[2]` is `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`, so `arr[2]` is `lex`.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`, so `arr[2]` is 26.

2. **Convert `arr[k]` to a character**:
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The formula used is `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - The ASCII value 96 corresponds to the character before 'a' (which is 97), so adding 96 to an integer `n` will convert it to the character at position `n` in the alphabet (e.g., `chr(1 + 96)` is 'a', `chr(2 + 96)` is 'b', etc.).

3. **Determine the output based on the value of `lex`**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be the character at position `lex` in the alphabet.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be the character at position `lex` in the alphabet.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr[2]` is 26, and `chr(26 + 96)` will be the character 'z'.

### Final Output:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the output will be the character corresponding to `lex` in the alphabet.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 51, the output will be the character corresponding to `lex` in the alphabet.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, the output will be 'z'.

Since `lex` is specified to be between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, we can simplify the output based on these ranges:

- If `lex` is between 0 and 24, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be the character at position `lex + 1` in the alphabet (since `lex` starts from 0).
- If `lex` is between 25 and 26, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be the character at position `lex + 1` in the alphabet.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr[2]` is 26, and `chr(26 + 96)` will be 'z'.

### Conclusion:
Output: **chr(lex + 96) (where lex is the third element of the list `arr` and is an integer between 0 and 26, or 'z' if lex is greater than or equal to 26)**
