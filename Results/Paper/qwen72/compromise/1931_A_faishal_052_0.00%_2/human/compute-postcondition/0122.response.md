Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -26 and -1. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between -1 and 24. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 51. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` was greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.***
