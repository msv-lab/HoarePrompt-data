Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing two elements (each element is either 1 or 26), and `lex` is updated as follows: if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is now `lex - 2`; if `lex` was between 26 and 51, it is now between 0 and 25; if `lex` was between 52 and 100, it is now between 26 and 74. `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because of `range(2)`.
- Each iteration appends either 1 or 26 to the list `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
- After the first iteration, `lex` is decreased by 1 if it was less than or equal to 26, or by 26 if it was greater than 26.
- After the second iteration, `lex` is decreased again by 1 if it was less than or equal to 26, or by 26 if it was greater than 26.
- Therefore, after 2 iterations:
  - If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it is now `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, it is now between 0 and 25.
  - If `lex` was initially between 52 and 100, it is now between 26 and 74.
- The variable `j` is 2 after the loop completes.
- The variables `cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
