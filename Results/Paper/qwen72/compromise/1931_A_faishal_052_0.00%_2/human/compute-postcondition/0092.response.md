The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range specified by `range(2)`. For the loop to execute, the range must be valid and `j` must be within the range specified by `range(2)`, which means `j` must start from 0 or 1. Since the initial state of `j` is 2, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
