Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its current value. Since the initial value of `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` is greater than or equal to 26. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
