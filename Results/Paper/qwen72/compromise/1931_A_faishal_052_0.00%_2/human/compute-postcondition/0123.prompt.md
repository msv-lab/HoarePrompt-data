Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains `[1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 26 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 27. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -26 and -1. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between -1 and 24. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 51. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` was greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
