Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because `j` is initialized to 0 and the loop condition is `j in range(2)`.
- After the first iteration, `lex` is reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on its initial value, and `arr` is updated accordingly.
- After the second iteration, `lex` is further reduced by either 1 or 26, and `arr` is updated again.
- The final state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the initial value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain `[1, 1]` and `lex` will be between 0 and 24.
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` will contain `[26, 1]` and `lex` will be between 0 and 24.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be greater than or equal to 26.
- The variables `cases`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
