The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop in Python.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0**
