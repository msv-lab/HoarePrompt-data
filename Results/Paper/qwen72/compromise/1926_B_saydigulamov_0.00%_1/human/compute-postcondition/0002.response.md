Output State: **The variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and appends these counts to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, `k` is printed. After all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is reset for each test case.**
