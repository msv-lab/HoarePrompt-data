Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines of n characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.**
