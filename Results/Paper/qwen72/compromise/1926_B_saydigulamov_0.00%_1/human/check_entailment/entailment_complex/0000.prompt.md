Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines of n characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and appends these counts to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, `k` is printed. After all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases, and the list `k` is reset for each test case.
