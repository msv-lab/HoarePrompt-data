### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - It also correctly reads the grid rows and checks for the presence of '1's in each row.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program appends the count of '1's in each row to a list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.
   - The program then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square.
   - This logic is insufficient because:
     - A square should have all elements in `k` equal.
     - A triangle should have elements in `k` forming a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) or (5, 3, 1, ...).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".
   - This is a clear mismatch with the problem description, which requires a specific string output based on the shape detected.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Output Mismatch**:
  - The program does not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.
  - Instead, it prints the list `k`, which is incorrect.

- **Shape Detection Logic**:
  - The program's logic for detecting the shape is flawed.
  - It only checks the first two elements of `k` to determine if the shape is a square, which is insufficient.
  - A correct implementation should check all elements in `k` to ensure they are equal for a square, or form a sequence of odd numbers for a triangle.

### Conclusion:

- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine the shape and does not produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
