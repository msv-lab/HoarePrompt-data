### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - It reads `n` lines of input for each test case and checks if each line contains at least one '1'. If it does, it counts the number of '1's in that row and appends the count to the list `k`.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.
   - After reading all the rows, it checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
   - This logic is insufficient for the following reasons:
     - A square should have all elements in `k` equal.
     - A triangle should have elements in `k` forming a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) or (5, 3, 1, ...).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` if `k[0] == k[1]`.
   - This is incorrect because the program should print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.

### Issues:
- **Output Mismatch**:
  - The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").
  - This is a clear violation of the problem description.

- **Shape Detection Logic**:
  - The program only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
  - For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal.
  - For a triangle, the elements in `k` should form a sequence of odd numbers in either ascending or descending order.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly determine the shape and does not produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
