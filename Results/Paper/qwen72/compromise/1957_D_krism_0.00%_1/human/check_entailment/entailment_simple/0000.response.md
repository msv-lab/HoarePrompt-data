### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case, but it does not accept any parameters. This is incorrect because the function should accept the number of test cases and the test cases themselves as parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated. The `prefix` array is initialized with a 0 at the beginning, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index. This is correct.

3. **Bitwise Count Initialization:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to count the number of 0s and 1s at each bit position. However, the initialization of `pre` is incorrect. The line `pre[i][0] += 1` is outside the loop and only increments the count for the 0th bit position. It should be inside the loop to initialize the counts correctly for all bit positions.

4. **Suffix Bitwise Count Update:**
   - The suffix bitwise count update is correct. The `suf` array is updated to count the number of 0s and 1s at each bit position for the elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1.

5. **Answer Calculation:**
   - The answer calculation is incorrect. The logic for calculating the number of tuples is flawed. The current logic sums the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position, which does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding tuples `(x, y, z)` such that `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

6. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The bitwise operations used to check the conditions are correct, but the logic for counting the valid tuples is not. The current implementation does not correctly implement the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given conditions. The function definition is also incorrect, and the initialization of the `pre` array is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
