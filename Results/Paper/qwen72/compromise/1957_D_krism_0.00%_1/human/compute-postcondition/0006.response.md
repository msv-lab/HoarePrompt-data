To determine what will be printed by the `print(arr, prefix)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers. The exact values of the elements in `arr` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.

2. **`prefix`**: This is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.

Let's walk through the construction of `prefix` step by step:

- The first element of `prefix` is 0 (as specified in the initial state).
- The second element of `prefix` is `arr[0]` (since 0 XOR `arr[0]` = `arr[0]`).
- The third element of `prefix` is `arr[0]` XOR `arr[1]`.
- The fourth element of `prefix` is `arr[0]` XOR `arr[1]` XOR `arr[2]`.
- And so on, until the last element of `prefix` which is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.

Given this information, the `print(arr, prefix)` statement will output the list `arr` and the list `prefix` as described.

Output: **[arr] [prefix] (where `arr` is a list of integers and `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0, and the length of `prefix` is `n + 1` where `n` is the length of `arr`)**
