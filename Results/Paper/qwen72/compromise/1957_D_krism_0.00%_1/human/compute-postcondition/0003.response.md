Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `prefix` is a list containing a single element 0.**

The variable `prefix` is now a list containing a single element, which is 0. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
