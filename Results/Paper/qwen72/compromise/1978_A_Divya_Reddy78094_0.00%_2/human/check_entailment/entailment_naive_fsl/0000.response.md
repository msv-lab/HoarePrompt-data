Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of books and the pages in each book. It sorts the list of pages in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest values, which corresponds to the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. This approach ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are always selected, regardless of the number of books or the distribution of pages, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
