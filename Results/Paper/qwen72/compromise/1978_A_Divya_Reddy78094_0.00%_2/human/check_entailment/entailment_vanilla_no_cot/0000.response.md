Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages in descending order. This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages. This is the correct approach because, by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile, the maximum total number of pages Alice can read is the sum of the two largest values in the list.

The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
