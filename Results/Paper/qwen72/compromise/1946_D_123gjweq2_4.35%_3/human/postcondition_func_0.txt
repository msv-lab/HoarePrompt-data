The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, but it does not use the integer `x` in its execution. The function returns the maximum integer value from the list `arr`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum integer value from the list `arr` is returned, and the input list `arr` and integer `x` remain unchanged.
