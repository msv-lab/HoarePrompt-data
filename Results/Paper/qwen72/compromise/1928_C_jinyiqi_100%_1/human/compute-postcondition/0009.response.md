Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2], `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2)] if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), otherwise `output2` remains a list containing [x].**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `output1` remains a list containing [1, 2].
- If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), then `output2` is updated to include the integer division result of `x` by `i` (i.e., `int(x / 2)`), so `output2` becomes [x, int(x / 2)].
- If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `output2` remains a list containing [x].
