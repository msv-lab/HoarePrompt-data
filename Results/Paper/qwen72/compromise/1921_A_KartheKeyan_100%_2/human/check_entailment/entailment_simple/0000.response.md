Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, which can lead to incorrect results. Sorting the coordinates does not necessarily align them in a way that the first and second points, or the third and fourth points, are adjacent corners of the square. This is a critical mistake because the distance calculation should be done between adjacent corners, not just any two points.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`). This is not a reliable way to determine the side length of the square, especially after sorting the coordinates.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then rounding the result. This is incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared, not the product of two distances.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `n` and iterating through each one.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the side length of the square by finding the distance between two adjacent corners.
- Calculate the area as the side length squared.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
