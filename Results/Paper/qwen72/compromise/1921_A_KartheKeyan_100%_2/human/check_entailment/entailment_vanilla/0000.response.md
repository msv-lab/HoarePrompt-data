Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to handle each test case. Inside each iteration, it reads four pairs of coordinates, which are the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Storage and Sorting**: The coordinates are stored in a list `coord`. The program then sorts this list. Sorting the coordinates is a good approach because it helps in identifying the side lengths of the square. However, the sorting should be done in a way that groups the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the same side together.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths**: The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent points (p1 and p2). The idea is to find the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two adjacent points. However, the program should ensure that it is calculating the distance between points that are actually adjacent on the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of the squared distances and then multiplying them. This is incorrect because the side length of the square is already the square root of the squared distance, and the area should be the side length squared, not the product of two side lengths.

5. **Output**: The program prints the rounded area for each test case. The rounding is unnecessary because the area of a square with integer coordinates will always be an integer.

### Issues:
- The sorting of coordinates does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to calculate the side length directly. The points should be sorted first by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate to ensure that adjacent points are correctly identified.
- The area calculation is incorrect. The area should be the side length squared, not the product of two side lengths.

### Corrected Approach:
- Sort the coordinates first by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate.
- Calculate the side length by taking the difference between the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) of adjacent points.
- Calculate the area by squaring the side length.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort coordinates first by x, then by y
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the side length
        side_length = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues in sorting and area calculation.

Correctness: **False**
