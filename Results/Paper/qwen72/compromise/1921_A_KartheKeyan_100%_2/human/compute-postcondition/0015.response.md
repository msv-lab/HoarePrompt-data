Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, and the function still accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**

The `coord` list is now sorted, which means the tuples are arranged in ascending order based on the values of `x` and `y`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
