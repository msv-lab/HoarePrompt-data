Output State: **`i` is 1, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, which already contains the tuple `(x, y)`. Therefore, after the execution, `coord` will contain two identical tuples `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `range`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
