The variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decreased by 1 and must be non-zero. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is decreased by 1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.**
