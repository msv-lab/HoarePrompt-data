Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, and the function still accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `range` is 4, and `x` and `y` are input integers.
- The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively.
- After executing this code, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input values, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated values of `x` and `y`.
