Output State: **`i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `i` is 3 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop), `range` remains 4 (unchanged), `x` and `y` are updated to the latest input integers, and `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each representing the coordinates `(x, y)` input during each iteration of the loop.
