Output State: **`i` is 1, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user input. The values of `i` and `range` remain unchanged, and `coord` still contains the tuple `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are now the new input integers.
