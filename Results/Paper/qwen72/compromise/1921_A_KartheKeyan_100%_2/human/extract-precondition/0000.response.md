Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the input structure. Here is a more appropriate function definition:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
