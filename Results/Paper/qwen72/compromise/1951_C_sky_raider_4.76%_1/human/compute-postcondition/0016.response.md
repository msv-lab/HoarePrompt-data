Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - 2 * min(m, k)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` from it again, which means `k` is now `k - 2 * min(m, k)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
