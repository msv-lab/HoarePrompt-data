The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` from it, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is now `k - s` (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`), `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**
