To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions within the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it is reasonable to assume that `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1, and `i` is initialized to 0 (as it is the starting point of the loop).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0**
