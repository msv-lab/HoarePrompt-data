Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2 + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - 2 * min(m, k)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 2, `l[i]` is `l[2]`.
- The new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2 + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
