Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `l`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` was a sorted list of integers provided by the user, but now it is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
