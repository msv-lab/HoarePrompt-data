Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string s.**
