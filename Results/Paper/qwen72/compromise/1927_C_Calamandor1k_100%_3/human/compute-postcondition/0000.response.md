Output State: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k. For each tuple, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), and k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)). Each test case is followed by two lists of integers, a and b, with lengths n and m, respectively, and each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6). `results` is an empty list.**
