### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine how many different arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is derived from `a` and then sorted.
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases and output the result modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - n` (where `n` is the offset to handle negative indices).
   - The initial state `dp[n] = 1` represents the starting point with a prefix sum of 0.
   - For each element in the array, we update the `dp` array to account for adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, we check the value of `dp[p[-1] + n]` to get the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array `p`.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and constructs the necessary data structures for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `n = 1` and when the prefix sums are not possible (e.g., `p = [0]` for `n = 1`).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the specified range and avoids overflow issues.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic in `func_1` and the input handling in `func_2` are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
