Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum up to the current position.

2. **Offset Handling**: The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices in the `dp` array, ensuring that all indices are non-negative.

3. **State Transition**: The state transition in the dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented. For each position `i`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. This ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is correctly calculated.

4. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated by checking the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset.

5. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs within the constraints. It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and valid.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and no counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
