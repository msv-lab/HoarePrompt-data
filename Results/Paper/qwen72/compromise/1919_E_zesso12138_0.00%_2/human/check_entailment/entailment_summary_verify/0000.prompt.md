You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of processing each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array. The function calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum up to the current position.

2. **Offset Handling**: The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices in the `dp` array, ensuring that all indices are non-negative.

3. **State Transition**: The state transition in the dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented. For each position `i`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. This ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is correctly calculated.

4. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated by checking the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset.

5. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs within the constraints. It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and valid.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and no counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
