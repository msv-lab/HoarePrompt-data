Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting the range of possible prefix sums to non-negative indices.
   - The DP table is updated iteratively for each step, considering both possible moves (+1 and -1).
   - The final result is calculated by determining the position in the DP table corresponding to the sum of the last element in `p` and `n`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `p` of `n` integers.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `p` to compute the number of valid initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]`.
   - The function correctly returns 0 for invalid cases where no valid initial array `a` can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The function ensures that the result is taken modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers, as required by the problem statement.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly from standard input, and the output is printed to standard output as specified.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
