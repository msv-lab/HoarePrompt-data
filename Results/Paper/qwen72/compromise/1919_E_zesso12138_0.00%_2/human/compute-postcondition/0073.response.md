The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` using the formula `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `j` is 2.
- `new_dp[j - 1]` is `new_dp[1]`.
- `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`.

The new value of `new_dp[1]` is calculated as `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`.

Since `new_dp` is initially a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `new_dp[1]` is 0.

Therefore, the new value of `new_dp[1]` is `dp[2] % MOD`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[2] % MOD`, `j` is 2.**
