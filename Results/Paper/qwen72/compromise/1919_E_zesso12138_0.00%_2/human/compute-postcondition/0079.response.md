Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `p[-1] + offset` to `final_sum`.
- Since `offset` is equal to `n`, `final_sum` becomes `p[-1] + n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
