The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n. The function returns the number of ways to reach the position `final_sum - n` from position `0` using exactly `n` steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD. Here, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element in the list `p` and `n`.
