Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[2:2 + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 2 + `n`, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**. 

The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` and `p` as arguments, and its return value is stored in the variable `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
