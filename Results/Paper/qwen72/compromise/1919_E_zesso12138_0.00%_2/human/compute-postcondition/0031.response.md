Initial State: `results` must be a list with at least one element remaining to iterate over.

Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list with at least one element. However, the variable `res` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` without additional context.

Since `res` is not defined, attempting to print `res` will result in a `NameError` because Python will not recognize `res` as a defined variable.

Output: **NameError: name 'res' is not defined**
