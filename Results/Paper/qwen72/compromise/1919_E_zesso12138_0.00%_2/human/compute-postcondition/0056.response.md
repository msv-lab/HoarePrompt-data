Postcondition: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from any position `k` in the previous `dp` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros, `j` is 0, and the current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0.**
