Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 0.** 

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `data`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
