Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, `u` is now `True` - 1 (which evaluates to `False`).**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially `True` (which is equivalent to 1 in Python), decrementing it by 1 results in `u` becoming `False` (which is equivalent to 0). The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
