Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged: each test case consists of `n` (an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` (an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, `u` is 0, `c` and `d` are the last values returned by `r()`, and the relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0. `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is zero, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c` and `d` are the final values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration of the loop. If the final `c` is less than the final `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop has executed all iterations, `a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The variable `b` will have been updated to contain `t + 4` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, `b` will start with `[0, 0]` and then append `t + 2` new elements, each of which is the sum of the previous two elements in `b` plus a value determined by the condition `v > x - w` or `v > z - y`. The values of `t` and `u` remain unchanged except that `u` is now zero (having been decremented until it no longer evaluates to `True`). The new values of `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()` during the last iteration of the loop. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
