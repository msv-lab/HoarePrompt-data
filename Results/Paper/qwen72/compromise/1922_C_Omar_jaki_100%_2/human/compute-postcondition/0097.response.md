To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
- `b` is a list that starts with `[0, 0]` and then appends `t + 2` new elements. Each new element in `b` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop.
- `t` is a constant value.
- `u` is one less than its previous value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`).
- `c` and `d` are the next two values returned by `r()`, and `c` is less than `d`.

### Understanding the Calculation:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), ..., r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - The list `a` has `t + 4` elements in total.

2. **List `b`**:
   - `b` starts with `[0, 0]`.
   - For each iteration of the loop, a new element is appended to `b` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified.
   - The new elements in `b` are calculated as follows:
     - If `v > x - w`, the new element is `b[-1] + b[-2] + 1`.
     - If `v <= x - w`, the new element is `b[-1] + b[-2] - 1`.
   - This process continues until `b` has `t + 4` elements.

3. **Indices in `b`**:
   - `b` has `t + 4` elements.
   - The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are used to access specific elements in `b`.

### Calculation of Indices:
- `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `c < d`.
- The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are valid because `b` has `t + 4` elements, and `c` and `d` are within the range of valid indices.

### Final Calculation:
- The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` will compute the difference between the elements at these indices in `b`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `c = 2` and `d = 3` (for simplicity, assuming `r()` returns these values).
- Then, `(d - 1) * 2 = (3 - 1) * 2 = 4` and `(c - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2`.
- The expression becomes `b[4] - b[2]`.

### Conclusion:
- The exact values of `b[4]` and `b[2]` depend on the specific values of `a` and the conditions in the loop.
- However, the output will be the difference between the elements at the calculated indices in `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list of elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the conditions specified in the loop, and c and d are values returned by r() such that c < d)**
