Postcondition: ***`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, `u` is `False`, `c` is the first element returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second element returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.***
