Output State: **`a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, where `t` must be at least 1. `w` is the second value returned by `r()`. `x` is the third value returned by `r()`. `y` is the fourth value returned by `r()` if `t` is at least 1. `z` is the fifth value returned by `r()` if `t` is at least 2. `v` is `y - x`. `b` is updated by appending two new elements: `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2]`; and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `b` is updated by appending two new elements.
- The first element appended to `b` is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise it remains `b[-2]`.
- The second element appended to `b` is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise it remains `b[-1]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
