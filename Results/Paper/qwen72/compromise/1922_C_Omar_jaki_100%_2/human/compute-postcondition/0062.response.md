Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input minus 2, and it must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
- `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop.
- `u` is now one less than its original value.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`, and `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction:**
   - The list `a` starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - It is followed by `t + 2` values generated by the function `r()`.
   - It ends with `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b` Construction:**
   - The list `b` contains `t + 2` elements.
   - Each element in `b` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and some conditions specified in the loop. The exact formula for these differences is not provided, but we know that `b` is derived from the differences in `a`.

3. **Indices Calculation:**
   - `c` and `d` are indices into the list `b`.
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1]` accesses the element at index `c * 2 - 1` in `b`.
   - The expression `b[d * 2 - 1]` accesses the element at index `d * 2 - 1` in `b`.

4. **Subtraction and Print:**
   - The code subtracts the value at index `d * 2 - 1` from the value at index `c * 2 - 1` and prints the result.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the difference between the values at the specified indices in the list `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by the function r(), and b is a list of t + 2 elements derived from the differences between consecutive elements in a)**
