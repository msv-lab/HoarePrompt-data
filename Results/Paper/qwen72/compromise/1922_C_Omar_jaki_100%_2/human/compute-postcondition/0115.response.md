The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the following inputs:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
  - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries.

The function returns, for each query `(x_i, y_i)`, the distance between the cities at positions `a[x_i]` and `a[y_i]` on the number line.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their positions on a number line, and a set of queries. For each query, it returns the distance between the specified cities.**
