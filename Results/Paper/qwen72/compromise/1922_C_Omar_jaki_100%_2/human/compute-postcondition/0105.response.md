To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`.
   - Ends with `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Contains `t + 4` elements.
   - Each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop.

3. **Variable `t`**:
   - Remains unchanged.

4. **Variable `u`**:
   - Is now one less than its previous value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`).

5. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are the next two values returned by `r()`.
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), ..., r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - The list `a` has `t + 4` elements in total.

2. **List `b`**:
   - `b` is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [a0, a1, a2, ..., an]`, then `b` might look like `[a1 - a0, a2 - a1, ..., an - an-1]`.
   - Since `a` has `t + 4` elements, `b` will have `t + 3` elements.

3. **Indices in `b`**:
   - The indices used in the print statement are `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.
   - These indices must be valid within the range of `b`, which has `t + 3` elements.

4. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`.
   - The condition `if c < d` is given, but it doesn't affect the calculation directly. It only tells us the relative order of `c` and `d`.

5. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will compute the difference between the elements at the specified indices in `b`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the logic, the print statement will output the difference between the elements at indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `b` is a list of differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`)**
