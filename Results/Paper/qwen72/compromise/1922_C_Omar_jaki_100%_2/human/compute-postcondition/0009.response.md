To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` must have at least 4 elements.
- `b` is a list with two zeros: `b = [0, 0]`.
- `v` is equal to `y - x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `b = [0, 0]`
   - `v = y - x`

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `b[-1]` is the last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `1` (since `v ** 0` is `1`).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `1`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - First element to add to `b`: `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w) = 0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
   - Second element to add to `b`: `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y) = 0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

4. **Updated List `b`:**
   - If `v > x - w` is `True`, the first element added is `v`.
   - If `v > x - w` is `False`, the first element added is `1`.
   - If `v > z - y` is `True`, the second element added is `v`.
   - If `v > z - y` is `False`, the second element added is `1`.

### Final Output State:
- `b` will be updated to `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `v`, `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is equal to `y - x`.**
