Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Closest Cities**: The program does not explicitly handle the concept of finding the closest city for each city. It uses a list `b` to store cumulative distances, but it does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city, which is a requirement of the problem.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates distances using a complex formula involving powers and comparisons, which is not straightforward and may not correctly reflect the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

3. **Query Handling**: The program processes queries by subtracting values from the `b` list, but it does not clearly show how it ensures the minimum number of coins for each query. The logic for handling the queries is not transparent and may not work for all cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, it assumes that the closest city is always the next or previous city, which may not be true for all inputs.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins may not produce the correct results for these queries, especially for the more complex ones like traveling from city 1 to city 5.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
