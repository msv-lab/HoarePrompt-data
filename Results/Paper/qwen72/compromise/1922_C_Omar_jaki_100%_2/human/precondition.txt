t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
