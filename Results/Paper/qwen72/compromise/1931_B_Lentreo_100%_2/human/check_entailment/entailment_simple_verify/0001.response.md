### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount is divisible by `n` using `total % n != 0`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. This means the condition `total % n != 0` will never be true, and the program will always proceed to the next steps.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations using `mean = total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the water amounts using the given operations (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than can be poured back in to balance the containers.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Annotations Verification:
- **State before function call:**
  - `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list.
  - This is consistent with the problem constraints.

- **State within the function:**
  - `n` is the length of `nums`.
  - `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`.
  - `total % n` is equal to 0.
  - `mean` is the mean amount of water that each container should have.
  - `curr` is initialized to 0 and is used to track the cumulative difference.

- **Loop and Condition:**
  - The loop iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
  - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the program returns 'NO'.
  - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. The unnecessary check for `total % n != 0` does not affect the correctness of the program because it will never be true given the problem constraints. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
