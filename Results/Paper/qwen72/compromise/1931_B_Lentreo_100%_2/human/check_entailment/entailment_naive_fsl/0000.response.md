Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. According to the problem description, this check is unnecessary because it is guaranteed that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Water Distribution Check**: The program then calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`). It iterates through the list `nums` and keeps a running total of the difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean. If at any point this running total (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns 'NO' because it would be impossible to pour water from a container with less water than the mean to a container with more water.

4. **Correct Logic**: The logic in the function `func_1` is correct. If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that it is always possible to balance the water by pouring from containers with more water to containers with less water, as required by the problem.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs 'YES' if it is possible to balance the water and 'NO' if it is not.

Given these points, the program handles all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
