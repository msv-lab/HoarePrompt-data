You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, and `total % n` is equal to 0.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `curr` is 0, `n` and `mean` remain unchanged, `total` remains unchanged.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It checks if the list can be balanced such that the cumulative difference from the mean of the list never becomes negative. If the list cannot be balanced, it returns 'NO'. If the list can be balanced, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount is divisible by `n` using `total % n != 0`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations using `mean = total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the water amounts using the given operations (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than can be poured back in to balance the containers.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct. It correctly checks the feasibility of balancing the water amounts in the containers based on the given operations and constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
