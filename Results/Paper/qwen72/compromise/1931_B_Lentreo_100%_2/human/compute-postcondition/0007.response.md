The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `curr` being 0 and the other conditions (`total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (which is the default behavior of `range(n)`).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
