Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.** 

In natural language: The initial conditions remain unchanged. The variable `mean` is now assigned the value of the integer division of `total` by `n`. This means `mean` is the average of the integers in the list `nums`, and it is an integer because the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list.
