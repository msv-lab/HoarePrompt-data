Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns the value of `count`, which is either 1 or 0, depending on the conditions for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.***
