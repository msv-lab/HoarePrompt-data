To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop head is:
```
for k in range(0, n - j):
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `k` (the loop variable)
- `n` (the length of the list `s`)
- `j` (which is `n // 2`)

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if the range `0` to `n - j` is non-empty.
- For the range to be non-empty, `n - j` must be greater than 0.
- Given `j = n // 2`, the condition `n - j > 0` simplifies to `n - (n // 2) > 0`.

### Simplifying the Condition:
- `n - (n // 2) > 0`
- This can be rewritten as `n > n // 2`.

### Analyzing the Condition:
- For `n > n // 2` to be true, `n` must be at least 2. This is because if `n` is 1, `n // 2` is 0, and `1 - 0` is 1, which is not greater than 0.
- If `n` is 2, `n // 2` is 1, and `2 - 1` is 1, which is greater than 0.
- For any `n` greater than 2, `n - (n // 2)` will always be greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`.
- `count` is 0.

### Adjusting the State:
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, which is already given in the initial state.
- The loop variable `k` will start at 0 and will iterate up to `n - j - 1`.

### Final State:
- `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.

State: **`s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0**
