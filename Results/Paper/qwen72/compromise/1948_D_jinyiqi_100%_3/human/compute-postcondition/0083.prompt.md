Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. `s` is now a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark. `n` is the length of `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j - 1`. `count` is the number of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` from `k = 0` to `k = n - j - 1`. If `count` reaches `j` at any point, the program prints `2 * j` and returns. Otherwise, the loop completes and `count` is less than `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j - 1`, and `count` is either 0, 1, 2, or `j`. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns the value of `count * 2`. Otherwise, the program does not return, and `count` remains based on the conditions encountered during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j - 1`, and `count` is the number of consecutive times the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` was true for the last `j` iterations, or 0 if the condition was not true for `j` consecutive iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
