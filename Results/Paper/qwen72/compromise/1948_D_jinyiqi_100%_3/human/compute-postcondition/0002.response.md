The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts with `j` set to `n // 2` and decrements `j` by 1 until `j` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` must be at least 1 for the loop to start). Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `j` must be set to `n // 2`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
