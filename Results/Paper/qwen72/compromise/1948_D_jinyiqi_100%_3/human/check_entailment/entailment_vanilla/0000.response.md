### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the string `s` is read from the input and converted to a list of characters for easier manipulation.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible half-length (`n // 2`) down to 1.
   - For each half-length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2*j` that can be a tandem repeat by comparing characters in the first half with the corresponding characters in the second half.
   - If either character is a question mark (`?`) or the characters are already equal, it increments a counter `count`.
   - If the characters are not equal and neither is a question mark, it resets the counter `count` to 0.
   - If the counter `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns from the function.

4. **Output**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints `0`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Tandem Repeat Check**:
  - The program correctly checks for the longest possible tandem repeat by starting from the largest half-length and working downwards.
  - The use of the counter `count` ensures that it only prints the length of the tandem repeat if it is valid (i.e., the first half matches the second half after replacing question marks).

- **Handling Question Marks**:
  - The program correctly handles question marks by considering them as wildcards that can match any character. This is done by checking if either character is a question mark or if they are already equal.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks. It follows the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
