Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the element 1.** 

The value `1` has been appended to the list `eta`, so `eta` now contains the element `1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
