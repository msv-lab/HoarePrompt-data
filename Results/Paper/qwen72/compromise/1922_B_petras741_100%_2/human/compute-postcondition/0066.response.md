Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list if `q[j]` is not greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing the integer 0.***
