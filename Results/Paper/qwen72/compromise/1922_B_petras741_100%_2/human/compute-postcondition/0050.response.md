Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q[eta[0]]` and is greater than 0. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of all values in `q` at indices in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 and 2 from each value in `q` at indices in `eta`, plus the sum of the combinations of 2 from each value in `q` at indices in `eta` multiplied by the sum of all values in `q` at indices in `eta` up to the current index. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.***
