Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]]`, `res` is the value of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]]) + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value, where `j` is 2.
- The previous value of `rho` was `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]]`.
- After the update, `rho` becomes `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]]`.
- The value of `res` is calculated using the updated value of `rho`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
