Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `w`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer, which are still valid after the code execution.
- The new value of `w` is a list of integers provided by the user.
