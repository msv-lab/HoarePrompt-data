Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, and `q[w[2]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 2.
- Therefore, `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The list `q` still has `n + 1` zeros, but now `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, and `q[w[2]]` are each incremented by 1.
