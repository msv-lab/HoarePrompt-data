Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `n` is the input integer and does not change.
- The list `w` remains the same list of integers input by the user.
- The list `q` is now a list of length `n + 1`, and each element at the index corresponding to the values in `w` (i.e., `q[w[j]]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- The loop variable `j` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
