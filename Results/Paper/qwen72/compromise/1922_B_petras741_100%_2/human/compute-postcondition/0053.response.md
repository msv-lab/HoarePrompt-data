Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user.**

The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` updates the variable `w` to be a list of integers obtained from the user input. The input is split by spaces, and each element is converted to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
