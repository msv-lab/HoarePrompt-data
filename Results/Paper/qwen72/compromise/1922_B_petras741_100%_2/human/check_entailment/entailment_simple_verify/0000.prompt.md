You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each a_i represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, 2^{a_i}. The input must be provided in the format described, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the lengths of the sticks are such that no non-degenerate triangle can be formed, even though there are more than 3 sticks. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts combinations where the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick, which is a requirement for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick. However, the program will output a non-zero result, which is incorrect.

The program should only count valid combinations where the triangle inequality holds for all three sticks. The current implementation does not ensure this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
