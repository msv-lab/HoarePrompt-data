The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop counter is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as the loop counter is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than `st - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are all equal.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is `st - 1`.
- `r` is `st - 1`.
- `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`.
- `end` is `n - st`.
- `ans` is `le - max(st, n - st)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.

The loop head `for _ in range(int(input())):` does not directly depend on any of the variables mentioned above except for the loop counter `_`. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`, and `ans` is `le - max(st, n - st)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.**
