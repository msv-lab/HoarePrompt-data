Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
