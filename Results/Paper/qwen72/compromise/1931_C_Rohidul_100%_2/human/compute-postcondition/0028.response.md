Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`, `ans` is `le - (st + end)`, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.
- `st + end` is `st + (n - st)`, which simplifies to `n`.
- Therefore, `ans` is `le - n`.
- Since `ans` is set to the maximum of 0 and `le - n`, if `le - n` is negative, `ans` will be 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` remain unchanged.
