Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**

The variables `st` and `end` are both assigned the value 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
