To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

The loop condition is:
```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is greater than 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition, but it affects `r`)
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input (relevant to the loop condition)
- `le` is the length of the list `a` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `r` is `n - 2` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `st` is `l + 1` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `end` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` (relevant to the loop condition)

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- The current state indicates that `r` is `n - 2` and `l` is less than `r`.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also hold true for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must still be greater than `l`.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also be true.

Since `r` is `n - 2` and `l` is less than `r`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `a[r]` is still equal to `a[r - 1]`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`
- `r` is `n - 2`
- `st` is `l + 1`
- `end` is 2
- `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`
- Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**
