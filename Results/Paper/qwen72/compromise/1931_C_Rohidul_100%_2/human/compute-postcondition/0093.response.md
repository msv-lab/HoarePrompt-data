Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input for each test case, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[-1]` or `0` if all elements are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)` if `a[0] != a[-1]` or `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0] == a[-1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `a` is a list of integers provided as input.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the last element of `a`, or `0` if all elements are equal.
- `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`.
- `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`.
- `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)` if the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, or `max(0, le - (st + end))` if they are equal. This value is printed for each test case.
