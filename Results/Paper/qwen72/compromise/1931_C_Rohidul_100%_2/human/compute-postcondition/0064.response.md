Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new input and converts it into a list of integers.
- `a` is now updated to the new list of integers provided by the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged, but `le` will now be the length of the new list `a`.
- The conditions for `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are still valid based on the new list `a`.
