Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are equal (since `a[0] == a[-1]`), `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`, `ans` is `le - max(st, n - st)`.**
