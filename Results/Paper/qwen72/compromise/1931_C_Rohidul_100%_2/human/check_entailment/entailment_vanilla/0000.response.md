### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal by applying an operation that assigns a value \( x \) to a subarray from index \( i \) to \( j \).
   - The cost of this operation is \( (j - i + 1) \) burles.
   - We need to find the minimum cost to achieve this.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array elements.
   - It initializes two pointers \( l \) and \( r \) to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes two counters \( st \) and \( end \) to 1, which will count the number of consecutive elements at the start and end of the array that are equal to the first and last elements, respectively.
   - The program then moves the left pointer \( l \) to the right as long as the elements are equal to the first element.
   - Similarly, it moves the right pointer \( r \) to the left as long as the elements are equal to the last element.
   - The cost to make the array equal is calculated as \( \text{le} - \max(\text{st}, \text{end}) \), where \( \text{le} \) is the length of the array.
   - If the first and last elements are equal, the cost is adjusted to \( \max(0, \text{le} - (\text{st} + \text{end})) \).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already equal (all elements are the same), the cost should be 0. This is handled correctly by the program.
   - If the array has only one element, the cost should also be 0. This is handled correctly by the program.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the cost should be 1. This is handled correctly by the program.
   - If the array has more than two elements and the first and last elements are different, the program correctly calculates the cost to make the array equal by either extending the subarray from the start or the end.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the longest prefix and suffix that are equal to the first and last elements, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to make the array equal by either extending the prefix or the suffix.
   - The special case where the first and last elements are equal is also handled correctly by adjusting the cost to account for the combined length of the prefix and suffix.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program correctly outputs 4.
   - For the input `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program correctly outputs 0.
   - For the input `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the program correctly outputs 2.
   - For the input `[1]`, the program correctly outputs 0.
   - For the input `[1, 2]`, the program correctly outputs 1.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly outputs 2.
   - For the input `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the program correctly outputs 6.
   - For the input `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the program correctly outputs 7.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
