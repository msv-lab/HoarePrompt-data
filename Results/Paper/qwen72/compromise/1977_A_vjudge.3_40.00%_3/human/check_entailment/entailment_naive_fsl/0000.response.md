Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `n` is even and `m` is odd, or `n` is odd and `m` is even, but `m` is less than `n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 3`, the program will output "No", but it should output "Yes" because Nikita can achieve a tower of 3 cubes after 4 moves by putting a cube 3 times and then removing one cube. The program incorrectly assumes that the parity of `n` and `m` must match for a "Yes" output, which is not always true.
