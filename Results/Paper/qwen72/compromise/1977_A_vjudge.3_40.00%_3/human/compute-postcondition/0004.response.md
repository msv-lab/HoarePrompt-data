Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input. It then checks several conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on these conditions for each test case. The conditions are: if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is greater than `n`, if `m` equals `n - 1`, if both `m` and `n` are even, or if both `m` and `n` are odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `n` and `m` input by the user, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. **
