The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` within the range of 1 to 100 and return a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both integers within the range of 1 to 100, and returns a result based on these parameters.**
