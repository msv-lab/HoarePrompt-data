You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    1000
    
    6

Output

    6
    18
    98

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` integers, where each integer is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The value of `best_y` for each `x` is the largest `y` (1 ≤ y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, and `y` itself, is maximized. If multiple `y` values produce the same maximum sum, the function selects the largest `y` among them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the loop where it tries to find the best `y`. Specifically, the `break` statement inside the loop causes the program to exit the loop prematurely as soon as it finds a `y` that has a greater sum than the current `max_sum`. This means that the program does not necessarily find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for all possible `y` values. For example, for `x = 10`, the program will output `5` because it finds that `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 7` and breaks the loop, even though `gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 8` is a higher value. Therefore, the program does not always return the correct `y` that maximizes the sum.
