Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `gcd_val` is 1. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `x`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, `y` is `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `y` retain their original values.***
