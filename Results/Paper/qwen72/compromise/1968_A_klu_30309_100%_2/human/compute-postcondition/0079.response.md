Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.***
