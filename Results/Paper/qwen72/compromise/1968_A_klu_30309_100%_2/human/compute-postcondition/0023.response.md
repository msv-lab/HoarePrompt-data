Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`.**

The code snippet `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is already defined as `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `best_y` now holds the same value as `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
