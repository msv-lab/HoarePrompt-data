To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. For the loop to execute at least once, `x - 1` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer
- `x` is the first integer in the list
- `results` is an empty list
- `max_sum` is 0
- `best_y` is 1

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `x - 1` is greater than or equal to `1`, which means `x` must be at least `2`. Since `x` is already specified to be at least `2` (as per the problem statement), we only need to ensure that `y` starts at `x - 1` and is greater than `0`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0**
