Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`, `y` is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `y = x - 1` down to `y = 1`.
- For each iteration, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is calculated and stored in `gcd_val`.
- The sum of `gcd_val` and `y` is stored in `current_sum`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to `y`.
- The loop breaks immediately after the first update to `max_sum` and `best_y`, meaning that the loop will only execute until it finds the first `y` that maximizes `current_sum`.
- After the loop finishes, `y` will be 1, because the loop iterates down to 1.
- The final values of `max_sum` and `best_y` will be the maximum `current_sum` and the corresponding `y` value found during the loop iterations, respectively.
- The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
