Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`, and `y` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`test_cases`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`results`**: Contains the value of `best_y` appended to it after the loop completes.
- **`max_sum`**: After all iterations, `max_sum` will be the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop.
- **`best_y`**: After all iterations, `best_y` will be the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`.
- **`y`**: The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 1. After the loop completes, `y` will be 1.

The loop iterates through all values of `y` from `x - 1` down to 1, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, and then the sum `gcd_val + y`. If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated, and the loop breaks. If no such `y` is found, the loop will complete all iterations, and `y` will be 1.
