Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is `x`, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `x`.**

Explanation:
- `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`, which is `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `best_y`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or expressions.
