To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`left < len(s)`**: This condition checks if the index `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
2. **`s[left] != '1'`**: This condition checks if the character at index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
- `cost` is 0.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
- `left` is 1.
- `s[0]` is '0'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`left < len(s)`**:
   - `left` is currently 1.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, which is the same as the length of `sChar`.
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `left` is 1 and `len(s)` is at least 2 (as `sChar` has a minimum length of 2), this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`s[left] != '1'`**:
   - `left` is 1.
   - `s[1]` must not be '1' for the loop to execute.
   - The current state does not specify what `s[1]` is, but it must be checked. If `s[1]` is '0', the loop will execute. If `s[1]` is '1', the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s[1]` is not '1'. If `s[1]` is '0', the loop will execute one more time.

### Final State:
Since `left` is already 1 and `len(s)` is at least 2, no adjustment is needed for `left` or `len(s)`. We only need to ensure that `s[1]` is '0'.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, and `s[1]` is '0'**
