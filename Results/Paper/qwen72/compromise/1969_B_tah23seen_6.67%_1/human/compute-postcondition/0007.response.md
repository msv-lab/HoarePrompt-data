Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `i` is the last character of `sChar`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `s` will contain all the characters from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`. The variable `i` will hold the last character of `sChar`.
