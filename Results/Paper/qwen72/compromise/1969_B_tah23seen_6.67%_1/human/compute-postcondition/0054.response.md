To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `right < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` was incremented by 1 (`right = right + 1`).
   - For the loop to execute again, `right` must still be less than `len(s)`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s[right]` must not be '0' (if `right` was less than `len(s)` before the increment).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`right`**: Since `right` was incremented by 1, it must still be less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute again.
- **`s[right]`**: The character at the new `right` index must not be '0'.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `right` must be such that `right < len(s)`.
- The state of `s[right]` must be such that `s[right] != '0'`.

Given the current state:
- `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `right` is now `right + 1`.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
- `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`.
- `s[right]` must not be '0' (if `right` was less than `len(s)` before the increment).

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now `right + 1`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[right]` must not be '0' (if `right` was less than `len(s)` before the increment).**
