### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost.
   - A cyclic shift operation on a substring costs the length of that substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the binary string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to 0 and 1, respectively, and a `cost` variable to 0.
   - The main loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and updates the cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

4. **Issues with the Solution:**
   - The logic for moving the `right` and `left` pointers is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple '1's followed by multiple '0's.
   - The cost calculation is incorrect because it only accounts for the cost of the current swap, not the total cost of sorting the string.
   - The function does not ensure that the string is fully sorted after the operations.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'.
   - The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the string minus the maximum of these two counts.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the sorting of the binary string and does not calculate the minimum cost accurately. The logic for moving the pointers and calculating the cost is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
