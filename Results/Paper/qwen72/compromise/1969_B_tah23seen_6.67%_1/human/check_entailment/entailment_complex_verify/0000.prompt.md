You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

while t:

def func_1(sChar):

        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1

            right += 1

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (consisting of only '0' and '1') with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order but with all '0's moved to the front and all '1's moved to the back, `cost` is the total number of swaps performed to achieve this arrangement, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is the index of the first '1' in the final `s` (or the length of `s` if no '1' is found), and `right` is the length of `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed to move all '0's to the front and all '1's to the back in the list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string such that all '0's are moved to the front and all '1's are moved to the back. The original string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function internally works with a list `s` that contains the characters of `sChar`. After the function concludes, the list `s` will have all '0's at the beginning and all '1's at the end, and the return value is the total number of swaps performed to achieve this arrangement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the sorting of the binary string. Specifically, the approach of swapping individual elements does not align with the problem's requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Cyclic Shift Implementation**: The program attempts to swap individual elements (`s[right]` and `s[left]`) rather than performing a cyclic shift on a substring. This means the program is not following the specified operation of cyclically shifting a substring.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on the distance between `right` and `left`, but this does not accurately reflect the cost of a cyclic shift operation as defined in the problem statement.

3. **Handling of Substrings**: The program does not correctly handle the selection and cyclic shifting of substrings. It only swaps individual elements, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input string `101011`.

- **Expected Output**: The minimum cost to sort the string `101011` is 5.
  - One possible sequence of operations:
    1. Choose the substring `101011` and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 110101`.
    2. Choose the substring `110101` and perform a cyclic shift: `110101 -> 111010`.
    3. Choose the substring `111010` and perform a cyclic shift: `111010 -> 111100`.
  - Total cost: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 (but the optimal cost is 5).

- **Actual Output**: The program will not produce the correct output because it does not perform cyclic shifts correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
