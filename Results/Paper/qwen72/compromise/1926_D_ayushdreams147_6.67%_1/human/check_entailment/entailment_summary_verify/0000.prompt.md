You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the presence of these XORed values, but the final state of `count` is not relevant to the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the condition where the numbers in the same group must not have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed:

1. The program uses `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to invert the bits of `num` from the 1st to the 31st bit. However, this operation inverts all 32 bits of the number, including the 32nd bit, which is not part of the 1st to 31st bits as specified in the problem description.

2. The program incorrectly updates the `count` dictionary and increments `res` in a way that does not ensure the correct grouping of numbers. Specifically, it checks if `num` is not in `count` and then uses the inverted value of `num` to update the count, which does not align with the problem's requirement that no two numbers in the same group should have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.

3. The program does not correctly handle cases where the same number appears multiple times. For example, if the input contains multiple `0` values, the program will incorrectly place them in different groups, which violates the problem's requirement.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
The expected output is `2` because the numbers can be grouped as follows:
- Group 1: `0, 2147483647`
- Group 2: `0, 2147483647`

However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly places each `0` in a separate group.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. One possible approach is to use a bitmask to track the groups and ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit pattern in the 1st to 31st bits.
