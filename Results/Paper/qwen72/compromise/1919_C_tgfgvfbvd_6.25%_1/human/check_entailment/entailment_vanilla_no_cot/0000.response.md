Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to properly calculate the minimum penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and counting the penalties as defined. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Penalty Calculation**: The logic used to update `a` and `b` and count `c` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty. The conditions and updates for `a` and `b` are not aligned with the goal of minimizing the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences.

2. **Subsequence Handling**: The code does not clearly define how the elements are being split into two subsequences `s` and `t`. The variables `a` and `b` are used in a way that does not clearly represent the subsequences, and the logic for updating them is flawed.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The variable `c` is intended to count the penalty, but the conditions under which it is incremented do not match the problem's definition of the penalty.

A correct approach would involve:
- Identifying the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the number of increasing pairs.
- Counting the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence separately and summing them to get the total penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the penalty
        penalty = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array to count the number of increasing pairs
        for i in range(1, n):
            if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        
        # The optimal way to split the array is to put all elements in one subsequence
        # since any split will not reduce the number of increasing pairs.
        print(penalty)

func()
```

This corrected version directly counts the number of increasing pairs in the entire array, which is the minimum possible penalty since any split will not reduce this count.
