Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, then `a` is `l[y + 3]`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.***
