Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `c` is 0, and `y` is 3. If the fourth element of the list `l` is greater than the third element of the list `l`, then `b` is set to the fourth element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `y`, and the list `l` remain unchanged.***
