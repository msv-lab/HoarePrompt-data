Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
