The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 1 or 2 or 3, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 3` with `y + 3` being less than `n`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.**
