Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and greater than `b`.**
