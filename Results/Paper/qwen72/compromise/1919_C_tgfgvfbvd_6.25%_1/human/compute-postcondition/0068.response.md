Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is set to the element in the list `l` at the index `x`, which is `y + 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`) retain their initial values or conditions.
