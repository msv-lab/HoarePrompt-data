To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
```

The loop will execute if the range `range(y + 1, n)` contains at least one value. This means that `y + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `a` is the first element in the list `l`
- `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists)
- `c` is 0
- `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists)
- `x` is `n`

We need to ensure that `y + 1 < n` for the loop to execute. Let's break this down:

1. **`y` must be less than `n - 1`**: If `y` is `n - 1`, then `y + 1` would be `n`, and the range would be empty. Therefore, `y` must be less than `n - 1`.

2. **`x` must be set to the starting value of the loop**: The loop variable `x` should start from `y + 1`.

3. **`n` must be greater than `y + 1`**: This ensures that the range is not empty.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `y` must be less than `n - 1`.
- `x` should be set to `y + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`**.
