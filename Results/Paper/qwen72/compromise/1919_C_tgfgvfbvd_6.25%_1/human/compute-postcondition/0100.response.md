Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
