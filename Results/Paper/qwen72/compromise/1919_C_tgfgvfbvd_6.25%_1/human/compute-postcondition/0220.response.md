Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies specific elements in the array and counts the number of times certain conditions are met. Specifically, it finds the first element in the array that is greater than its preceding element and then iterates through the rest of the array to count how many times an element is greater than both `a` and `b` (where `a` and `b` are dynamically updated based on the values in the array). The function prints the count `c` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
