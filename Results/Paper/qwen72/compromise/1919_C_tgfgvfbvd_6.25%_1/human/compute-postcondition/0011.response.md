Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1. If the second element of the list `l` is greater than the first element of the list `l`, then `b` is set to the second element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `y`, and the list `l` remain unchanged.***
