Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.***
