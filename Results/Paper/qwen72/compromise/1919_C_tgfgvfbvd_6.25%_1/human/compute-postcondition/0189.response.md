Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0 or 1, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` remains less than `l[x]`.***
