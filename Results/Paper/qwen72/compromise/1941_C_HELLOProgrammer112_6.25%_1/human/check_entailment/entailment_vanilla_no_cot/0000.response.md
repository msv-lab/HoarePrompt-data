Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up, which does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still make the string ugly. For example, the string "mmapnapie" contains the substring "map" twice and "pie" once, but the correct solution would be to remove only 2 characters to make it beautiful (by removing the 'm' and 'p' in "mmap" to avoid "map" and the 'p' and 'i' in "pie" to avoid "pie").

A correct approach would involve checking for the presence of "map" and "pie" in a way that accounts for overlapping occurrences and ensures the minimum number of deletions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    # Initialize the count of deletions
    deletions = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 2:
        if s[i:i+3] == "map" or s[i:i+3] == "pie":
            deletions += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next two characters to avoid overlapping
        else:
            i += 1
    return deletions

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly identifies the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by checking for the substrings "map" and "pie" and ensuring that overlapping occurrences are handled appropriately.
