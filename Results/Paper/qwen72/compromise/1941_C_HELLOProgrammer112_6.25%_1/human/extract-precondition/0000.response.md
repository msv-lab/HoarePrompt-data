Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def make_beautiful(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string s has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
