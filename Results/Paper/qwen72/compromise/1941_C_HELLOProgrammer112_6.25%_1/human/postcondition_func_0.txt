The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the counts have been printed. The input variables `t` and `s` are not modified by the function.
