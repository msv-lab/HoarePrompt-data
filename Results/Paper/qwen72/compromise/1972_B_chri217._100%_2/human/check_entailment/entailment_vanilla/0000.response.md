### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, storing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to a list `cases`.
   - This function correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list, which is then returned.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It counts the number of facing-up coins (`U`) in the string `s` using a generator expression and the `sum` function.
   - The key observation here is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move. Since each move removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins, the number of facing-up coins changes by an odd number (either +1 or -1) each turn.
   - Therefore, the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will always be able to make the last move, and the player who starts with an even number of facing-up coins will always lose if both players play optimally.
   - The function returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - The game is deterministic, and the outcome depends solely on the initial number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the last move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win because he will be the one to make the last move.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (the player who is supposed to make a move loses).
   - The function also handles the case where there are only one or two coins left, as the logic of counting facing-up coins and determining the winner based on the parity of this count is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial number of facing-up coins. The input parsing and the game logic are both correct and consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
