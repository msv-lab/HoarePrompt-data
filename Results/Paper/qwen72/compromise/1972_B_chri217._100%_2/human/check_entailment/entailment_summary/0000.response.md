Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is will eventually lose because they will be the one to face a situation where there are no facing-up coins left. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even, forcing the opponent to eventually lose.

However, the provided `func_2` function checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins and returns 'YES' if the number is even, and 'NO' if the number is odd. This is the opposite of what the problem requires. The function should return 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd (Alice will win), and 'NO' if the number of facing-up coins is even (Bob will win).

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **False**
