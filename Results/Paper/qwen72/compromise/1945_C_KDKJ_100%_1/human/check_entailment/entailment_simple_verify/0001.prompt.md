You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to store the prefix sums of zeros and ones.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the prefix sums for zeros and ones. This is done by appending a new list to `S` for each character in `a`, where the first element is the count of zeros and the second element is the count of ones up to that position.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program then iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n+1`) where the road can be laid.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the position `ans` where the road should be laid.

### Analysis:

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The prefix sums are correctly calculated and stored in `S`. This allows for efficient computation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position `i`.

- **Condition Checking**:
  - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are correct. They ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice.
  - The program correctly updates the answer `ans` to the position that is closest to the middle of the village.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house (`i = 0`) and after the last house (`i = n`).

- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently calculates the prefix sums, checks the conditions for each possible position, and outputs the optimal position for the road.

### Correctness:
**True**
