Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.**

The code snippet assigns the value 0 to `low` and the value of `n` to `high`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not modified, and the value of `pos` remains as it was initially.
