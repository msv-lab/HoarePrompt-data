Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted condition is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect for the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
9 12 3 45
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the array can be transformed to `[9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO`.

The issue lies in the way the program handles the splitting of numbers and the comparison with the previous elements in the array. The program should correctly split all numbers greater than or equal to 10 and then check if the resulting array is sorted. The current implementation fails to handle this correctly.
