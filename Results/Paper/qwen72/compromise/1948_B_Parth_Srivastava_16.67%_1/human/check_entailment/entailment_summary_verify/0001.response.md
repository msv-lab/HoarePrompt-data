### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array**:
   - The function iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the transformed array `c` and checks if it is equal to the original transformed array.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

### Analysis:

- **Transformation Logic**:
  - The transformation logic is designed to split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them in the correct order. However, the logic for inserting the digits is flawed.
  - The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` ensures that the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`, but it does not ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing overall.
  - The condition `if y <= x` ensures that the digits are inserted in the correct order, but it does not handle cases where the original element should be split and inserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of the entire array.

- **Checking Sorted Order**:
  - The program checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. This is not sufficient because the transformation should ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing, not just that it is already sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The transformed array would be `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is not sorted, but it can be made non-decreasing by further operations (e.g., splitting `28` into `2, 8` and inserting them in the correct positions).

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `12 3 45 67`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `12 28 5`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`
  - Output: `NO` (Incorrect, should be `YES` because the array can be made non-decreasing by further operations)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Transformed: `[0, 0]`
  - Sorted: `[0, 0]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for transforming the array is flawed, and the final check to determine if the array can be sorted is not sufficient. The program should check if the transformed array can be made non-decreasing, not just if it is already sorted.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
