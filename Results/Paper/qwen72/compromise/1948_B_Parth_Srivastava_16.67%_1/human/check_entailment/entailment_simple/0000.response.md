### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates over the elements of `a` and checks if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
   - It then checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the previous element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it splits the element and appends the digits to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, it appends the original element.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to the transformed list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating that the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to `b` (indicating that the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output**:
   - After all test cases are processed, the program iterates over the results in `b` and prints 'YES' for `1` and 'NO' for `0`.

### Issues:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle the case where the array `a` is already sorted correctly. For example, if `a` is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` and then check if it is sorted. However, the program might not correctly handle the transformation and comparison in all cases.
- **Incorrect Transformation**:
  - The transformation logic is flawed. For example, if `a` is `[15, 23, 8, 34, 12]`, the program might not correctly transform and check the array. The correct transformation should be `[1, 5, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 1, 2]`, but the program might not handle this correctly.
- **Indexing and Length**:
  - The variable `n` is used to track the length of `c`, but it is not necessary. The length of `c` can be directly obtained using `len(c)`.
  - The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains elements that are exactly 10. For example, if `a` is `[10, 10, 10]`, the program should transform it to `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` and then check if it is sorted, but it might not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical flaws in the transformation and sorting steps, which can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
