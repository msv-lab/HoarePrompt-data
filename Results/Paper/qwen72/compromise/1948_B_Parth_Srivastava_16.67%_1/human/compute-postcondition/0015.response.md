The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 <= a_i <= 99), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
