The code snippet `b.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `b`. However, `b` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `1`, `b` becomes `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `a` is [15, 23, 8, 34, 12], `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `c` is [1, 5, 23, 8, 34, 12], `d` is [1, 5, 8, 12, 23, 34], `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is [1].**
