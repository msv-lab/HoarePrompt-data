The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `s` is an input string, which means it could be empty or non-empty. For the loop to execute, `s` must be non-empty, and `j` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`c` is 0, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must be non-empty, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer between 1 and 10 and a string of that length consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character of `s`**
