Reasoning:
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. According to the problem description and the state of the program, it should take the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` as parameters. This is a significant issue because the function cannot operate on the input data without these parameters.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads input directly within the function `func_1` using `input()`. This is not a problem in itself, but it does not align with the expected state of the program, which suggests that the function should be passed the test cases as parameters.

3. **Logic for Finding the Minimum Segment**:
   - The variable `c` is used to find the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
   - The variable `d` is used to find the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` by iterating over the string in reverse.
   - The function then returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` because the length of the segment from position `mi` to position `ma` is `ma - mi + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that there is at least one 'B' in the string `s`, which is guaranteed by the problem description.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the strip is already all white (which is not possible according to the problem description, but it's good to be aware of such edge cases).

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
