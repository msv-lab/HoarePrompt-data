The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 10) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. Each string s is guaranteed to have at least one 'B'.
