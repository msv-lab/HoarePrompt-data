The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell, and at least one cell is black.
