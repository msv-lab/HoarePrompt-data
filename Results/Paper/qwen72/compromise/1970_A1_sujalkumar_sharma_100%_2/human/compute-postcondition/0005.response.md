The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on the balance value in ascending order. If two tuples have the same balance value, they are sorted by the negative of the index in descending order, meaning the tuple with the higher index comes first.

Output State: **`prefix_balance` is sorted by the balance value in ascending order, and for tuples with the same balance value, by the index in descending order. The final value of `balance` is 0, as `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**
