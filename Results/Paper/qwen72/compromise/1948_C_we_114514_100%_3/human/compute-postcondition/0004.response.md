Output State: The variable `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not stored after the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration. The variable `results` is now a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each of the `t` test cases.
