You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it reads from standard input. The first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even) followed by two strings of length n, row1 and row2, each containing only the characters '<' and '>'.
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        row1 = input()
        
        row2 = input()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `n` retains the value of the last input provided during the last iteration of the loop. The variables `row1` and `row2` retain the values of the last inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration, with the number of elements equal to `t`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result_1]
    #[result_2]
    #...
    #[result_t]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the two rows can be made identical by flipping any number of characters in `row1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
