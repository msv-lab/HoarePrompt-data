The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input. First, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even) followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`, each of length `n` and containing only the characters '<' and '>'. After processing the inputs, the function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether the two rows can be made identical by flipping any number of characters in `row1`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the two rows can be made identical by flipping any number of characters in `row1`.**
