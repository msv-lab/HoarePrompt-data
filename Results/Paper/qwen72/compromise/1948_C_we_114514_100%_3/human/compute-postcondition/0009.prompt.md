You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
        
    #State: The loop either returns 'No' if the condition is met at any iteration, or it completes all iterations without returning 'No' if the condition is never met. The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `half_n` remain unchanged.
    if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<') :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: The loop either returns 'No' if the condition is met at any iteration, or it completes all iterations without returning 'No' if the condition is never met. The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `half_n` remain unchanged. Additionally, either `row1[n - 1]` is not equal to '<' or `row2[n - 2]` is not equal to '<' or both.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an even integer `n` within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'. It returns 'No' if the arrows in the grid do not form a valid configuration. It returns 'Yes' if the arrows in the grid form a valid configuration.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'Yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
