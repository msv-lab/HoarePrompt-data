### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the grid configuration.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n // 2 - 1`), checking if there is any configuration that would block the robot from moving to the next column. Specifically, it checks if the robot is in the first row and the arrow in the next cell of the first row points left (`<`), and either the arrow in the current cell of the second row or the arrow in the next cell of the second row points left (`<`). If this condition is met, the robot cannot move to the next column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot is in the last column of the first row and the arrow points left (`<`), and the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row also points left (`<`). If this condition is met, the robot cannot move to the last column of the second row, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results of all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Input Validation**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and ensures that the inputs are valid as per the problem description. It processes each test case independently.
- **Logic in `func_1`**:
  - The loop in `func_1` checks for blocking conditions in the first half of the grid. This is necessary because if the robot is blocked in the first half, it cannot reach the end.
  - The final check ensures that the robot can move to the last column of the second row. If either of these conditions is met, the robot is blocked, and the function returns 'No'.
  - If the robot is not blocked in any of these checks, it can reach the cell (2, n), and the function returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration. The input handling and the logic for checking the grid are both correct and meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
