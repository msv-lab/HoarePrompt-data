Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if the robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates through the first half of the columns (since n is even, `half_n = n // 2`).
   - For each column `i` in the first half, it checks if the robot can get stuck:
     - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the robot will be stuck and cannot proceed.
   - It also checks the last column:
     - If `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<', the robot will be stuck and cannot reach (2, n).
   - If none of these conditions are met, the robot can reach (2, n), and the function returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The program handles the constraints and input format correctly, and the logic in `func_1` is sound for determining if the robot can reach the target cell. Therefore, the program is correct.
