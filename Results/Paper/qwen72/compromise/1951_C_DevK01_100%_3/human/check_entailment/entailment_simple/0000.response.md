### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two lines: the first line contains `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains the list of ticket prices `a` for `n` days.
   - The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are correctly parsed from the first line, and the list `a` is correctly parsed from the second line.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The function ensures that `m` is not greater than `k` by setting `m = min(m, k)`. This is necessary because you cannot buy more tickets per day than you need in total.

3. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows you to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.
   - The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days you need to buy tickets to meet the requirement of `k` tickets.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `a` and stores them in `N`.
   - If `n * m == k`, it means you can buy exactly `m` tickets each day for `n` days. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which accounts for the initial cost of tickets and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means you need to buy a different number of tickets on the last day. The function calculates the cost for the last day separately and then adds the cost for the remaining days.

5. **Final Cost Calculation:**
   - The final cost is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for the Last Day:**
  - The logic for calculating the cost when `n * m != k` is flawed. Specifically, the line `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect. The term `n * m * mu` is not necessary and will lead to an incorrect cost calculation.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`, the cost calculation is correct.
- If `n * m != k`, the correct cost calculation should be:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + mu * w`
  - This accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets each day for `n-1` days, the additional cost due to the price increase, and the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the last day.

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the cost calculation for the last day when `n * m != k`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + mu * w
        
        print(cost)
        
    # The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two lines of input, processes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and prints the calculated `cost`.
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a minor issue in the cost calculation for the last day when `n * m != k`. The term `n * m * mu` is incorrect and should be removed.
