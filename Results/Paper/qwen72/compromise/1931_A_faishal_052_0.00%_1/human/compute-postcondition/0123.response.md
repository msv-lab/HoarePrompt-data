Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 1]. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26] respectively.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, so it executes exactly 2 times.
- After the first iteration:
  - If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes [1] and `lex` is decremented by 1.
  - If `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is decremented by 26.
  - If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is decremented by 26.
- After the second iteration:
  - If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes [1, 1] and `lex` is decremented by 1 again.
  - If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` becomes [26, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52.
  - If the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26] respectively.

Thus, after both iterations, the loop has completed, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
