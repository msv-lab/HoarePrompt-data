The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the range specified in the loop head. If `k` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]**
