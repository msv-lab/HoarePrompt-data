Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, and 26.** 

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` reduces the value of `lex` by 26. Since the initial state specifies that if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26, this condition is met, and the output state reflects the updated value of `lex` and the unchanged state of `arr`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
