The only variable in the loop head is `k`, and the loop will execute 3 times regardless of the initial value of `k` because `range(3)` will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2]`. However, for the loop to start, `k` should be set to 0, as the loop will iterate over the values 0, 1, and 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex`] if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 27`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52**
