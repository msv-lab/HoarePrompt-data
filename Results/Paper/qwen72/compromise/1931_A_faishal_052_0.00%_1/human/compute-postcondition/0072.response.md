Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is reduced by 1, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1].**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` reduces the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 1. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
