The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range of the loop, which is fixed at 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), the next value for `j` should be 2. However, since the loop will only execute if `j` is less than 2, the loop will not execute again after `j` is incremented to 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26] respectively.**
