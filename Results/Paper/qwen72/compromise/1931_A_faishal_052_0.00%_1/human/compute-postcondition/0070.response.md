The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, but the loop will still execute because `j` will be less than the range value of 2.

However, since the loop is set to iterate over a fixed range of 2, the loop will execute one more time regardless of the value of `j` after the adjustment, as long as `j` is incremented to 2. After this, the loop will terminate because `j` will no longer be less than 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26.**
