To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `k` is 1.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
   - `arr[k]` refers to the element at index `k` in the list `arr`.
   - `k` is 1, so `arr[k]` is the second element of the list `arr`.
   - `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the integer value `arr[k] + 96` to its corresponding character in the ASCII table.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that the print statement does not add a newline at the end, so the output will be printed on the same line.

3. **Determine the Value:**
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and `k` is 1, `arr[k]` is the second smallest element in the list.
   - The ASCII value for lowercase 'a' is 97. Therefore, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will convert `arr[k] + 96` to a lowercase letter.
   - For example, if `arr[k]` is 1, then `arr[k] + 96` is 97, which corresponds to 'a'.
   - If `arr[k]` is 2, then `arr[k] + 96` is 98, which corresponds to 'b'.
   - And so on.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Without the exact values of `arr`, we can't determine the exact character that will be printed.
   - However, we know that the character will be the lowercase letter corresponding to the second element of `arr`.

Output: **chr(arr[1] + 96) (where arr[1] is the second smallest element in the sorted list `arr`)**
