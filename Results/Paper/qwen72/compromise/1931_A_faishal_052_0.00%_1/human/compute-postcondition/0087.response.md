Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `lex` is an input integer.
   - The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2].
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].
     - If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - Since `k` is 2, we need to determine the value of `arr[2]` based on the value of `lex`.

4. **Evaluate `arr[2]` Based on `lex`**:
   - If `lex` <= 26, `arr[2]` is `lex - 2`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`.
   - If `lex` >= 52, `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`.

5. **Calculate the Character to be Printed**:
   - The `print` statement uses `chr(arr[k] + 96)` to convert the integer value `arr[2]` to a character.
   - The `chr` function returns the character whose ASCII value is `arr[2] + 96`.

6. **Determine the Output**:
   - If `lex` <= 26, `arr[2]` is `lex - 2`, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(lex - 2 + 96) = chr(lex + 94)`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(lex - 52 + 96) = chr(lex + 44)`.
   - If `lex` >= 52, `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(lex - 52 + 96) = chr(lex + 44)`.

7. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be a single character based on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` <= 26, the character is `chr(lex + 94)`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), the character is `chr(lex + 44)`.
     - If `lex` >= 52, the character is `chr(lex + 44)`.

Output: **chr(lex + 94) if lex <= 26, chr(lex + 44) if lex >= 27**.
