The value of `lex` is appended to the list `arr`. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The specific value of `lex` and the updated list `arr` depend on the initial value of `lex` as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the initial values plus `lex` at the end. If `lex` is less than or equal to 22, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 1, lex - 4]`. If `lex` is 23, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 1, lex - 27]`. If `lex` is greater than 23 and less than or equal to 49, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 1, lex - 27]`. If `lex` is 50, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 1, lex - 52]`. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 74, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 1, lex - 28]`. If `lex` is 75, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 1, lex - 53]`. If `lex` is greater than 75 and less than or equal to 100, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 1, lex - 53]`. If `lex` is 101, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 1, lex - 78]`. If `lex` is greater than 101 and less than or equal to 125, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 26, lex - 29]`. If `lex` is 126, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 26, lex - 53]`. If `lex` is greater than 126 and less than or equal to 150, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 26, lex - 53]`. If `lex` is 151, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 26, lex - 78]`. If `lex` is greater than 151 and less than or equal to 175, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 26, lex - 54]`. If `lex` is 176, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 26, lex - 79]`. If `lex` is greater than 176 and less than or equal to 201, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 26, lex - 79]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 202, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 26, lex - 104]`.**
