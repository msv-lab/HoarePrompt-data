Reasoning:

The program is intended to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given sum `n`. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded sum. It then tries to construct the smallest word by distributing the sum among the three letters.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Logic for Distributing the Sum**: The program's logic for distributing the sum among the three letters is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the conditions `if lex <= 26`, `elif lex < 52`, and `else` do not cover all possible cases and do not ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

2. **Handling of the Third Letter**: The program appends the remaining `lex` value to the array `arr` without considering whether it is a valid letter index (1 to 26). This can lead to invalid results if `lex` is greater than 26 after the first two letters are chosen.

3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` does not necessarily produce the lexicographically smallest word. The order of the letters in the word is important, and sorting them might change the order in a way that does not reflect the smallest possible word.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `lex` is 3, the smallest word should be "aaa" (1+1+1), but the program might incorrectly handle this case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Ensure the third letter is the smallest possible value that makes the sum equal to `lex`.
- Construct the word by converting the indices to characters and output the word.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
