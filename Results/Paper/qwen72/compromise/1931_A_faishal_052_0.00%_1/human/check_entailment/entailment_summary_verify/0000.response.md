### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded sum `lex` and initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.

2. **Logic for Distributing `lex`**:
   - The function uses a loop to distribute the value of `lex` across three positions in the list `arr`.
   - The logic for distributing `lex` is flawed:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the actual value of `lex` and set `lex` to 0.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that does not exceed `lex` and then subtract that value from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 52 or more, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is correct for the first two letters but fails to handle the case where `lex` is exactly 52 correctly.

3. **Appending the Final Value**:
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This is correct but only if the previous logic is correct.

4. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The function sorts `arr` in non-decreasing order and then prints the corresponding characters. This is correct for generating the lexicographically smallest word.

### Specific Issues:

- **Incorrect Distribution of `lex`**:
  - For `lex = 70`, the program will append 26, 26, and 18, but it will sort them to `1, 18, 26`, resulting in "azz" instead of "rzz".
  - For `lex = 52`, the program will append 26, 26, and 0, which is invalid because 0 is not a valid letter index.

### Correct Logic:

To correctly handle the distribution of `lex`, the program should:
1. Start by assigning the largest possible value to the first letter without exceeding `lex`.
2. Then, assign the largest possible value to the second letter without exceeding the remaining `lex`.
3. Finally, assign the remaining value to the third letter.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        for j in range(3):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is **accurate**. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when `lex` is greater than 26 and the distribution logic is flawed. The corrected code above should be used to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

Final: **False**
