You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, where `1 <= q <= 1000`. It then processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are left with the values of the last test case. The variable `mn` remains unchanged at 100, and `q` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are equal correctly. For example, if the input is `1 1 1`, the program will print `NONE` because it only checks for the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`, but it does not consider the case where `a == b == c`. According to the problem description, this should be considered as neither a stair nor a peak, but the program does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to incorrect output if the logic were to be extended or modified in the future. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `a < b` is not satisfied but `b > c` is, such as `3 4 1`, which should print `PEAK` but the program will print `NONE` because it does not break out of the loop after finding the first condition that is true.
