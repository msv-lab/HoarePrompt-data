The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function internally uses or processes values `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. 

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the provided constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to process or compute a result using the integers `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified ranges, and return a result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function processes integers `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` where `t` is between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are between 0 and 9, and returns a result based on these values.**
