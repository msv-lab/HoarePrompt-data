Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration of the loop. If the loop encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop, particularly where `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met.**
