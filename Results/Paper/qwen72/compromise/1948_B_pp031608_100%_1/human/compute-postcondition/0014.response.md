The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`, and the direction of the loop (decrementing). The loop iterates backward from `m - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so it becomes `m - 2`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be greater than `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` (which is now `nums[0]`), `nums` is a list containing the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.
- If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` is now `m - 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains True unless the conditions within the loop body cause it to change.**
