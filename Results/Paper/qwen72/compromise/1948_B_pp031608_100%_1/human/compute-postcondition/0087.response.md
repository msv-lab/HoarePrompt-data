To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(0 < n \leq 49\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 1\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is initially `True`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `arr` starting from index 1.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
   - If this condition is true, it further checks if the resulting `nums` list (which is not explicitly defined but assumed to be derived from `arr`) is not sorted.
   - If the `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses a list with two elements: `'NO'` and `'YES'`.
   - It selects the element based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, it prints `'YES'`.
   - If `ans` is `False`, it prints `'NO'`.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the value of `ans` depends on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check for the sorted `nums` list ever cause `ans` to be set to `False`.

- If the list `arr` is already sorted or can be made sorted by the specified conditions, `ans` remains `True`.
- If the list `arr` cannot be made sorted by the specified conditions, `ans` is set to `False`.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the possible outcomes of the loop logic.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True)**

However, to provide a more precise answer based on the given information:

Output: **'YES' (if the list `arr` is sorted or can be made sorted by the specified conditions) or 'NO' (if the list `arr` cannot be made sorted by the specified conditions)**
