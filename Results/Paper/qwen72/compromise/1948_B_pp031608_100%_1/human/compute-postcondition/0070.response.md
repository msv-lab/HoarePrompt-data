Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
