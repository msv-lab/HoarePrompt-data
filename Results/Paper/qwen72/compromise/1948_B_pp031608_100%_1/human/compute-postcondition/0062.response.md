Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This changes the value of `ans` from its previous state (which could have been either `True` or `False`) to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
