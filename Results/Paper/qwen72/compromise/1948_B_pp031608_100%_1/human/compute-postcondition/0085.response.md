Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains True unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case `ans` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the program continues with `ans` remaining True.***
