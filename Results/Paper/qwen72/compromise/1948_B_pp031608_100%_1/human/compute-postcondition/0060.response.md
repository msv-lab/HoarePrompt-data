The value of `m` is assigned the integer value of the user's input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the list `nums` remained sorted throughout all iterations.**
