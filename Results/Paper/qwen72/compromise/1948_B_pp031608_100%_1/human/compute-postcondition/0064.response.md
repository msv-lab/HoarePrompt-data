Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
