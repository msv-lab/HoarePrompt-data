The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterating over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and then appending `arr[i]` to the resulting list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `str(arr[i - 1])` converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string.
2. `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` iterates over each character in the string representation of `arr[i - 1]`, converts each character to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
3. `[arr[i]]` creates a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.
4. The two lists are concatenated using the `+` operator to form the final list `nums`.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 45, then:
- `str(arr[i - 1])` would be "123"
- `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` would be `[1, 2, 3]`
- `[arr[i]]` would be `[45]`
- `nums` would be `[1, 2, 3, 45]`

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True
- `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.**
