To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(0 < n \leq 49\).
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 2\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.
- If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).
- The loop condition is `i > 0`.

### State Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m - 2`.

### Final State:
- The state of `i` is adjusted to `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Result:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains True**.
