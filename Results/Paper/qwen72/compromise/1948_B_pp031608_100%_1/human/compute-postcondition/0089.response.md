The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple inputs, possibly through a more complex structure like a list of tuples or similar, where each element represents a test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- Each test case also includes a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= 99.

The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. Since the specific output is not detailed, I'll assume the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
