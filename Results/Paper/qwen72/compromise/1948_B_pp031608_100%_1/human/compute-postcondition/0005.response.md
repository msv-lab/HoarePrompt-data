To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop iterates over the range starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (`1`). This means `m - 1` must be at least `1`, which implies `m` must be at least `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `ans` is True

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The only relevant variable in the loop head is `m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `m` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- `i` is initialized to `m - 1` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1**
