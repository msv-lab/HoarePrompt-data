Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. Additionally, the list `nums` is not sorted.**
