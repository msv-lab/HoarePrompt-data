The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `0`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, starting from `m - 1` down to `1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to become `m - 3`, and it must still be greater than `0` for the loop condition to hold true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is decremented by 1 to `m - 3`.
- `m` remains the same, and `i` must be greater than `0` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
