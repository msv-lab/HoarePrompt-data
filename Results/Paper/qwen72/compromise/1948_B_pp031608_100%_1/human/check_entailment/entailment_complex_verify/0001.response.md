### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.

3. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the function to handle the most significant elements first, which is crucial for ensuring the array can be sorted.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If so, it means the array is not sorted at this point.

5. **Digit Splitting**:
   - If the condition is met, it splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - However, the logic here is flawed. The function should not just append `arr[i]` to the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]`. Instead, it should replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and then re-evaluate the entire array to ensure it is sorted.

6. **Update Array**:
   - If the digits are sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list. This is incorrect because it does not properly handle the replacement of `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and the subsequent re-evaluation of the array.

7. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic for identifying when the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements into their digits is flawed. The function should replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and then re-evaluate the entire array to ensure it is sorted.
  - The current implementation only checks the immediate neighbors and does not consider the impact of the digit splitting on the entire array.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle edge cases where the array needs to be re-evaluated after splitting elements into their digits.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in any element. This is efficient enough given the constraints, but the logic is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is not logically sound and does not handle all the specified cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to properly replace elements with their digits and re-evaluate the entire array.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
