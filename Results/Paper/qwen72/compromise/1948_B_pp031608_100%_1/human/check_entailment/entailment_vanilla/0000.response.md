### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function assumes that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).

4. **Condition Check**: For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If so, it means the array is not sorted at this point.

5. **Digit Splitting**: If the condition is met, it splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Update Array**: If the digits are sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list.

7. **Output**: After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements into their digits.
  - The backward iteration ensures that the function checks the most significant elements first, which is necessary for ensuring the array can be sorted.
  - The digit splitting and sorting check are performed correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or contain only single-digit numbers.
  - It also handles cases where the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in any element. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and handles all the specified cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
