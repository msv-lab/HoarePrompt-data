### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `N` times, where it reads an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the digits of all numbers from 0 to `n-1` (not from 1 to `n` as required) and adds this sum to a global variable `soma`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` converts the number `n` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers.
   - This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number.

4. **Global Sum Variable:**
   - The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of the digits for all test cases.
   - This is incorrect because the sum for each test case should be printed separately, not accumulated into a single global sum.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `soma` after processing all test cases.
   - This means that the sum of the digits for all test cases is printed as a single value, which is not the correct behavior according to the problem description.

6. **Range Issue:**
   - The program uses `range(n)` which means it calculates the sum of digits for numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The problem description requires the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we need to reset the sum for each test case, calculate the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to `n`, and print the sum for each test case separately.

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Correctness:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not handle the output for each test case separately and incorrectly calculates the sum of digits from 0 to `n-1` instead of 1 to `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
