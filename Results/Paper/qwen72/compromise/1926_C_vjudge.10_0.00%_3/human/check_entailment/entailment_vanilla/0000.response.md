### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `N` times, where it reads an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` and adds this sum to a global variable `soma`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` converts the number `n` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers.
   - This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number.

4. **Global Sum Variable:**
   - The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of the digits for all test cases.
   - However, this is incorrect because the sum for each test case should be printed separately, not accumulated into a single global sum.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `soma` after processing all test cases.
   - This means that the sum of the digits for all test cases is printed as a single value, which is not the correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle the output for each test case separately. Instead, it accumulates the sum for all test cases and prints it once, which does not match the problem's requirement to print the sum for each test case individually.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we need to reset the sum for each test case and print the sum for each test case separately.

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
