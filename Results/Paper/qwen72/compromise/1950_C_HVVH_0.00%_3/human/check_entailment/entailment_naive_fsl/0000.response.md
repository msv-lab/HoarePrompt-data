Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the hour is 12 and the time is in the AM. According to the problem description, 12:00 AM should be output as "12:00 AM," but the program incorrectly sets the day to "PM" for this case. For example, if the input is "12:00," the program will output "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM."
