Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a logical error in the way it handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the condition `else: day = 'PM'` is incorrect because it sets the day to 'PM' for hours that are 12 or less, which is not always correct. The correct logic should be:

- If the hour is 0, it should be converted to 12 and the day should be 'AM'.
- If the hour is greater than 12, it should be converted to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (by subtracting 12) and the day should be 'PM'.
- If the hour is exactly 12, it should remain 12 and the day should be 'PM'.
- For all other hours (1 to 11), the hour should remain the same and the day should be 'AM'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
        if h > 12:
            h = h - 12
        elif h == 0:
            h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
