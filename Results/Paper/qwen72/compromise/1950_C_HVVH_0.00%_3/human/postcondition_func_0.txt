The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of times to perform the following action: For each of the `n` iterations, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user, converts this time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and the input times remain unchanged, and the function has printed the converted times for each input.
