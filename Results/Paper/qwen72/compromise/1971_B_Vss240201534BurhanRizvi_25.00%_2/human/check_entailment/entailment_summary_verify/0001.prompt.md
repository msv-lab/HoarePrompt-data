You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the user, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and prints 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. After the loop completes, the final state of the program includes the values of `s` and `s2` from the last iteration, but these are not returned or used outside the function. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Rearranging the String:**
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - This function ensures that all characters in `s` are used exactly once in the new string `s2`.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the newly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` has all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"). In such cases, `random.sample` will always return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has only one character (e.g., "d"). In this case, `random.sample` will return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "Yes" or "No" and the rearranged string `s2` when applicable.
   - The output "Yes" and "No" are case-insensitive, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement. It generates a random permutation of the string and checks if it is different from the original string, which is the required behavior.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
