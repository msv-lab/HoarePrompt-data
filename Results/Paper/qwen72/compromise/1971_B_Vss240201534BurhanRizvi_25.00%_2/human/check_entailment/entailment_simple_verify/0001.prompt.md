You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to take a string `s` as an input parameter, where `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user. For each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the user, create a shuffled version `s2` of that string, and print 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it will print 'No'. The state of the variables `s` and `s2` will be updated for each iteration, but the final state of these variables after the loop finishes will be the values from the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Rearranging the String:**
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - This function ensures that all characters in `s` are used exactly once in the new string `s2`.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the newly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` has all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"). In such cases, `random.sample` will always return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has only one character (e.g., "d"). In this case, `random.sample` will return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "Yes" or "No" and the rearranged string `s2` when applicable.
   - The output "Yes" and "No" are case-insensitive, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement. It generates a random permutation of the string and checks if it is different from the original string, which is the required behavior.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
