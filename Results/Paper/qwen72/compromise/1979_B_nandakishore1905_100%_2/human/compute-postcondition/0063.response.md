Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `k` is determined by the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers, `k` will be a non-negative integer.
   - The exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, which are not provided in the initial state.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
