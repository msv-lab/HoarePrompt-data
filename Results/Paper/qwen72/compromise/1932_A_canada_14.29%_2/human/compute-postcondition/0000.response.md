The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. The number of iterations is determined by the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and the list of tuples are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
