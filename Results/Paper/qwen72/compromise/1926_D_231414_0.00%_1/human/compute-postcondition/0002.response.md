To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(times):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state (t, n, a_1, ..., a_n, check) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `times` is an input integer.
- `check` is 2147483647.

We need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
