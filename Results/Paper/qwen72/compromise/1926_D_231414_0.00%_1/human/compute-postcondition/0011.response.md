The code `dic[s] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `s` in the dictionary `dic` by 1. Since `s` is already a key in `dic`, the value associated with `s` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element, `dic` is a dictionary with `s` as a key and its value decreased by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR 2147483647, and `s` is a key in the dictionary `dic`.**
