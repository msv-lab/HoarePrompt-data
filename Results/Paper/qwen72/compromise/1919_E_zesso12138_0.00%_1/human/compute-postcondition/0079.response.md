Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop, `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n`, and `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` assigns the sum of the last element of the list `p` and the value of `offset` to the variable `final_sum`.
- Since `offset` is `n`, `final_sum` becomes `p[-1] + n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
