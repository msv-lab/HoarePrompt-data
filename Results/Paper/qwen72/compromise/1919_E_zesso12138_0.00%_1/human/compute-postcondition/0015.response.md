Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 + n` to `3 + n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged.
