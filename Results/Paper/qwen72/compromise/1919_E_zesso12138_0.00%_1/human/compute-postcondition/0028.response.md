Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The value of `n` is the last integer read from the `data` list during the final iteration.
- The list `p` contains the last set of integers converted from the corresponding slice of `data` used in the final iteration.
- The `input` function is still the same, being `sys.stdin.read`.
- The `data` list remains the same as it was initially.
- The `index` is updated to the position right after the last element of `data` that was used in the loop, which is `1 + t + (t * n)`.
- The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The `result` variable holds the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
