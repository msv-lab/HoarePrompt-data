You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a, where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop. Specifically, `dp` will have non-zero values at indices that are reachable by moving `i` steps left or right from the initial index `n`, and the values will be the result of cumulative additions modulo `MOD`. The exact values in `dp` depend on the cumulative effect of the updates from `new_dp` over all iterations. `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n`, and `new_dp` is no longer referenced.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of list `p` plus `n`. `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, and `final_sum` is an index within this list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of list `p` plus `n`. `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, and `final_sum` is an index within this list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
