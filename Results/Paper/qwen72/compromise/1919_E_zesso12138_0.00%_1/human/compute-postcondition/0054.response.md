Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of `2*n + 1` integers, all set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new state of `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` zeros.
