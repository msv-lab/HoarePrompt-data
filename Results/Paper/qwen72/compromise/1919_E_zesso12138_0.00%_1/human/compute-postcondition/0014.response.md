The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`. The index was previously set to `2 + n`, where `n` was the integer value of `data[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
