Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`. The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `input`, `data`, and `index` retain their values as described in the initial state. The `results` list contains all the return values from the calls to `func_1(n, p)` during the loop, and each of these values has been printed exactly once. The variable `result` holds the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
