Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case. It initializes `t` with the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading `n` and the list `p` for each case.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The `dp` array is initialized with a single entry at the offset position, and the transitions are correctly handled by updating the `dp` array based on the possible moves (adding 1 or -1).

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The function ensures that the indices for the `dp` array remain within bounds by checking `j + 1 <= 2 * n` and `j - 1 >= 0`.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is computed by adding the last element of `p` to the offset and returning the corresponding value from the `dp` array. This correctly accounts for the prefix sum and the offset.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure that the results are within the specified range (modulo 998,244,353).

6. **Output**: The results are collected and printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
