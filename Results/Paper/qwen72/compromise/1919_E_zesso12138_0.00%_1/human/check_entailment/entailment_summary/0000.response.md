### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.
   - The prefix sums `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The result should be computed modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, p)`**:
     - This function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given prefix sums `p`.
     - It initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2*n + 1` to handle the range of possible prefix sums.
     - The `offset` is used to shift the indices of the DP array to handle negative prefix sums.
     - The function iterates through each element of `p` and updates the DP array based on the transitions from the previous state.
     - Finally, it returns the value at the index corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the offset.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `p`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and collects the results.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

3. **Validation**:
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly handles the transitions between states, ensuring that all possible arrays `a` are considered.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the results.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly designed to solve the given problem. Both functions work together to handle the input, perform the necessary computations, and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
