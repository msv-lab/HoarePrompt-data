It seems there is a mismatch in the function definition provided and the problem description. The problem description indicates that the function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively. However, the function definition only includes one parameter `x`. Assuming the intention is to solve the problem as described, the correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, x):
```

Given this, the precondition for the function based on the problem description is:

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.**
