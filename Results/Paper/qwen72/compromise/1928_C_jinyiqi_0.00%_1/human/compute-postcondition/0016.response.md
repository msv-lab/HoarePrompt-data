Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is `int(x), `output1` is reversed.** 

The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `output1` is now in reverse order compared to its initial state.
