The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. The function is supposed to return the sum of `output2` and the reversed `output1`. However, since `output2` is not defined in the initial state, the function returns an error due to the undefined variable `output2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (1 <= x < n <= 10^9) and is intended to return the sum of `output2` and the reversed `output1`. However, it returns an error because `output2` is not defined.**
