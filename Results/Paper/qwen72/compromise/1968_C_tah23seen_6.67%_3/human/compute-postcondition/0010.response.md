Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] + ans[0] + ans[0]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `ans[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[1]` by adding `ans[0]` to it. Given that `i` is 0, `ans[1]` is initially `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] + ans[0]`. After the update, `ans[1]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] + ans[0] + ans[0]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
