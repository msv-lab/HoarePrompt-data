Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)`, where `k` is the smallest integer such that `ans[1]` is greater than `arr[1]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[1]` is greater than the current value of `arr[1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the list `ans` still has the same length `n` as `arr`. The first element of `ans` (`ans[0]`) is still `arr[0] + 1`. The second element of `ans` (`ans[1]`) has been incremented by adding `ans[0]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`) a number of times (`k` times) until `ans[1]` becomes greater than `arr[1]`. The variable `i` is still 0, and the condition `ans[1] > arr[1]` is now true, which means the loop has terminated.
