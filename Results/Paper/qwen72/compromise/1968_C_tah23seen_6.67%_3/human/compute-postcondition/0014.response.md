Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]` or `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1` otherwise, and `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1] + ans[1]`. `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2.**
