Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. After all iterations, `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. The values of `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and `ans[2]` will remain unchanged, and `i` will still be 2.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will keep adding the value of `ans[2]` to `ans[3]` until `ans[3]` becomes greater than `arr[3]`. Once this condition is met, the loop will stop. The values of `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and `ans[2]` will not change during the loop execution, and the index `i` will remain at 2. The final value of `ans[3]` will be the smallest number greater than `arr[3]` that can be obtained by adding `ans[2]` multiple times.
