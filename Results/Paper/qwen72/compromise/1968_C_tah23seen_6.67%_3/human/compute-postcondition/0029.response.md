The variables in the loop head are `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `ans[i + 1]` is now `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, and `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` must still be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Given that `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, we need to ensure that `arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to this new value of `ans[i + 1]`.

State: **The value of `ans[i + 1]` is now `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`**
