#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. `i` is `n-2`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is equal to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is calculated as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`, and if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is incremented by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
