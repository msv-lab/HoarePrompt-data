The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 200,000 and 0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- Case_1: The function returns `0, 0`.
- Case_2: The function returns `0, 0`.
- Case_3: The function returns `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, with `n` in the range [1, 200,000] and `k` in the range [0, 1,000,000,000,000]. It returns `0, 0` in the first two cases. In the third case, it returns `n` and `k` if `k` is an even integer, and if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, or if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
