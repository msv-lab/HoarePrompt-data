### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The function correctly checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - The function calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - For even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`.
     - For odd `n`, the maximum value is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`, indicating that a valid permutation might exist. This is also correct.

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function generates a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It starts by creating a list `l` of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The loop iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, attempting to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic inside the loop is as follows:
     - If `k` is zero, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of the list to the position `-k` from the end. This is intended to reduce `k` by the smallest possible amount.
     - Otherwise, it reduces `k` by `i - 1` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - The logic in `func_1` is intended to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value, but it may not always work correctly, especially for larger values of `k`. The condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent operations may not always produce the correct permutation. For example, it might not handle cases where `k` is large and requires more complex adjustments.

3. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" and then the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - This function is straightforward and correct.

4. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function handles the input and output for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
   - This function is correct in its structure and logic.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The logic in `func_1` is intended to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value, but it may not always work correctly, especially for larger values of `k`.
- The condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent operations may not always produce the correct permutation. For example, it might not handle cases where `k` is large and requires more complex adjustments.
- The function does not have a clear and systematic approach to ensure that the permutation is constructed correctly for all values of `k`.

### Conclusion:
- **Function 2** is correct and handles the validation of `n` and `k` properly.
- **Function 3** is correct and handles the output of the permutation properly.
- **Function 4** is correct in its structure and logic.
- **Function 1** has a complex and potentially incorrect logic for generating the permutation, which may not always produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is not guaranteed to always produce the correct permutation for the given `n` and `k`, especially for larger values of `k`. The logic in `func_1` needs to be more robust to handle all cases correctly.

Final: **False**
