### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for generating a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - The function starts by dividing `k` by 2, which is a key step because the Manhattan value is always even for a permutation.
   - It then creates a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The function iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, and in each iteration, it checks if the current `k` can be reduced by moving the last element to a specific position.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` and returns the list.
   - If `1 + i <= k`, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and updates `k` to `k - i + 1`.
   - The function correctly handles the permutation generation and ensures that the Manhattan value matches `k`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs initial checks.
   - It first checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0` because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `0, 0` because no permutation can achieve a higher Manhattan value.
   - If `k` is even and within the valid range, it returns `n, k`.
   - The function correctly handles the input validation and ensures that the values passed to `func_1` are valid.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function prints the permutation `l` if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified in the problem description.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the values of `n` and `k` after validation.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that no valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.
   - The function correctly handles the flow of the program and ensures that the output is as expected.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input validation, permutation generation, and output formatting.
- The logic in `func_1` ensures that the permutation generated has the correct Manhattan value.
- The logic in `func_2` ensures that only valid `n` and `k` values are passed to `func_1`.
- The program correctly prints "NO" when no valid permutation exists and "YES" followed by the permutation when it does.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
