The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. Additionally, `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initialized to `False` and `None`, respectively. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function operates with predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), where `x` and `y` contain integer coordinates, `r` contains integer radii, and `visited` and `coef` are initialized to `False` and `None` respectively. The function does not return any value.**
