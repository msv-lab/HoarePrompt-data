Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `True`.
- `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `1`.
- `tot` is 0.
- `bipartite` is `True`.
- `ok` is `True` because at least one `dfs(i)` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement is a simple print of the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The print statement will always output the string `'YES'` regardless of the state of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
