### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the modified list `a` using `print(*a)`.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The program generates a permutation of length `n` by reversing the elements at even indices.
   - This approach ensures that the elements at even indices are in a different order from the original, which helps in breaking the pattern where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct `i` and `j`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are not in the same order as the original, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. This permutation does not have any `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - For `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`, which is a valid permutation.
   - For larger values of `n`, the same logic applies, ensuring that the permutation is valid.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Even Indices Reversal:**
  - The key operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices. This means that the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the list are reversed.
  - For example, if `n = 4`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After the operation, `a` becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
  - For `n = 5`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After the operation, `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

- **Divisibility Pattern:**
  - The original list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` has a natural order where smaller numbers are followed by larger numbers.
  - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the sequence of elements at even indices is not in the same order as the original, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
  - For instance, in the list `[4, 2, 3, 1]`:
    - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
    - `p_3 = 3` does not divide `p_1 = 4`.
    - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
    - `p_4 = 1` does not divide `p_2 = 2`.

- **General Case:**
  - For any `n`, the list `a` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
  - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list will be `[n, 2, n-1, 4, n-2, 6, ..., n%2+1, n-1, n%2]`.
  - This ensures that the elements at even indices are in descending order, and the elements at odd indices are in ascending order.
  - This pattern helps in breaking the divisibility condition because the elements at even indices are no longer in the same order as the original, and the elements at odd indices are in a different order as well.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Final: **True**
