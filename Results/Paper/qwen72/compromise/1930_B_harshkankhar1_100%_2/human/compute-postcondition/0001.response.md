Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), but the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are now in reverse order.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`. The elements at odd indices remain unchanged. For example, if `n` is 5, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After executing the code, the list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. The elements at indices 0 and 2 (1 and 3) are reversed to 5 and 3, while the elements at odd indices (2, 4) remain the same.
