Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: For `n > 1`, the program calculates two potential costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - `ans2`: The cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`) and the remaining yogurts (if any) are bought at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).

4. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The program then prints the minimum of these two costs, ensuring that Maxim spends the least amount of burles.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1, and it also correctly calculates the minimum cost for larger values of `n` by considering both the regular and promotion prices. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
