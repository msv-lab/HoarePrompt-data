You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates two values: `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1, the function prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Edge Case for Single Yogurt**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt, and there is no promotion to consider.
   - This is correct because the minimum cost for one yogurt is simply the price of one yogurt.

3. **General Case for Multiple Yogurts**:
   - The program calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
   - `ans2` is calculated by:
     - `b * (n // 2)`: This is the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost for buying any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The sum of these two parts gives the total cost if Maxim uses the promotion as much as possible.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, and prints the result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
