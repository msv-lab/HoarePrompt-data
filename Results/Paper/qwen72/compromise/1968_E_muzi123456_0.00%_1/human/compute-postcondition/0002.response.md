Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**. 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is one less than the initial value. The range of `t` is now 0 to 49. The value of `n` for each test case remains unchanged.
