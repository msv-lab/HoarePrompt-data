Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`**. 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` still equal to `n`.
