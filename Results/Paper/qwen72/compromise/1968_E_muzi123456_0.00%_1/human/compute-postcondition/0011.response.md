The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as its first argument.
- The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Precondition:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement will simply output the string `'1'` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **

Note: The output will be "1 " (the number 1 followed by a space).
