Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 3 in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

### Output:
Output: **3**

This is because the value of `i` is explicitly given as 3, and the `print` statement will simply print this value.
