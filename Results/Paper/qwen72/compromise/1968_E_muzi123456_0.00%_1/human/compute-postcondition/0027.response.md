Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 0 and 48. The variable `n` also remains unchanged and is still an input integer greater than or equal to 2. The variable `i` will have the value of `n` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the final value of `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
