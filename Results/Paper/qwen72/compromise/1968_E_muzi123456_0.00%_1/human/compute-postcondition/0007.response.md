The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
