Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which contains the distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The provided function `func` attempts to achieve this by always placing the cells in the first row, i.e., at positions \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\).

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - The Manhattan distance between any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|\).
   - Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all possible values of \(|i-j|\) for \(1 \le i, j \le n\).

2. **Distinct Distances**:
   - For \(n\) cells in the first row, the possible values of \(|i-j|\) range from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - This means that \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \(n\) distinct values: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

3. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\) when the cells are placed in the first row, which is the maximum possible size for \(\mathcal{H}\) given \(n\) cells.
   - This is because the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances between \(n\) points in an \(n \times n\) grid is \(n\).

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the coordinates of the cells in the format specified in the problem description.
   - It prints \(n\) lines for each test case, each containing two integers: the row (always 1) and the column (from 1 to \(n\)).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as shown in the example.
   - It also handles larger values of \(n\) up to 1000 correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case and prints the required output format.

Correctness: **True**
