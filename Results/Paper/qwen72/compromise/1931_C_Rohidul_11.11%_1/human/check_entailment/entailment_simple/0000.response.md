### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes `st` and `end` to 0, which will be used to count the number of consecutive elements from the start and end of the array that are equal to the first and last elements, respectively.

3. **Consecutive Elements Check:**
   - The function uses two while loops to move the pointers `l` and `r` inward until they find the first and last elements that are not part of a consecutive sequence of equal elements.
   - `st` is incremented for each consecutive element from the start that is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `end` is incremented for each consecutive element from the end that is equal to `a[-1]`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Cost:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the function calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`. This is because the elements between `l` and `r` (exclusive) can be set to `a[0]` or `a[-1]` with the minimum cost.
   - If `st` and `end` are both 0 and the first and last elements are not equal, the function calculates the cost as `len(a) - 1`. This is because the entire array needs to be set to a single value, and the cost is the length of the array minus one.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the cost as `r - l`. This is because the elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) need to be set to a single value, and the cost is the number of elements in this range.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated cost to ensure that the cost is non-negative.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: All elements are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]` and `st` and `end` are not 0):**
  - The function correctly calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`, which is the number of elements in the middle that need to be changed.
  
- **Case 2: The array is already uniform (`a[0] == a[-1]` and `st` and `end` are 0):**
  - The function correctly calculates the cost as 0, which is correct since no changes are needed.
  
- **Case 3: The array has different first and last elements, and no consecutive elements are equal to the first or last element (`st` and `end` are 0):**
  - The function correctly calculates the cost as `len(a) - 1`, which is the cost to set the entire array to a single value.
  
- **Case 4: The array has different first and last elements, and there are consecutive elements equal to the first or last element (`st` or `end` is not 0):**
  - The function correctly calculates the cost as `r - l`, which is the number of elements between the first and last unique elements that need to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
