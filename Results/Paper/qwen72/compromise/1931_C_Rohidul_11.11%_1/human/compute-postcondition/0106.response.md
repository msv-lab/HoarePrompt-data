The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the array.

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the general functionality of the function is to process multiple test cases, each with an array of integers, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
