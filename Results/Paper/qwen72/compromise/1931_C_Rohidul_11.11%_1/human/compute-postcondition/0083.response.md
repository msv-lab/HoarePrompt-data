The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `st` is 3, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` were 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, and `a[2] == a[3]`**
