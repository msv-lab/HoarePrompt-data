Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input where the first `st` elements are all equal and the last `end` elements are equal, `l` is `st`, `r` is `l`, `st` must be less than `n - end`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list, `ans` is 0, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is assigned the value of `r - l - 1`.
- Since `r` is equal to `l`, the expression `r - l - 1` simplifies to `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.
- However, the initial state specifies that `l` is `st` and `r` is `l`, so `r - l` is `0`.
- Therefore, `ans` is `0 - 1`, which simplifies to `0`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
