Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is `l`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**
