Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` were 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer greater than 1.
- The list `a` remains the same as the user input.
- The variable `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, which means it is the last index where the current element is different from the next element.
- The variable `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, which means it is the first index from the end where the current element is different from the previous element.
- The variable `st` remains the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`.
- The variable `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`.
- The variable `ans` is 0 if the first element `a[0]` is equal to the last element `a[-1]`. If they are not equal, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` only if both `st` and `end` were 0 initially, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`.
