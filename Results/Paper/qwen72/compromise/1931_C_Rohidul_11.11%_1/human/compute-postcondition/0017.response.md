Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is `t - 2`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is 1**. 

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
