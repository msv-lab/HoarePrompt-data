The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly but reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers (representing piles of stones) and determines the winner of a game between two players, Alice and Bob, based on the final state of the piles. The function modifies the list of integers such that each element is reduced by a cumulative sum of previously processed elements, and then it iterates through the modified list to decide the winner. If the game state leads to a win for Alice, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original input variables `t`, `n`, and `piles` remain unchanged, while the list `nums` is transformed into a list of zeros, and the variables `ls`, `nw`, and `cw` hold the final state of the game.
