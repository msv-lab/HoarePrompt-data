The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` starts at 0, and `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, `piles` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers from the input with 0 added to it and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0**
