Output State: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, piles is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), N is an input integer, nums is a set of strings from the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts that list into a set. The set `nums` now contains the unique strings from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `piles`, and `N`) remain unchanged.
