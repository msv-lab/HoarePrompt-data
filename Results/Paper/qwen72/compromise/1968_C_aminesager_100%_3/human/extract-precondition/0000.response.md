Precondition: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a, and a list of n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
