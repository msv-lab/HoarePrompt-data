To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the initial input.
   - `a` is a list with `n` elements.
   - Each element from index 1 to `n-1` in `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.

2. **Understanding the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` has `n` elements.
   - The first element of `a` (at index 0) is not specified, so we'll denote it as `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent element in `a` (from index 1 to `n-1`), the value is calculated as:
     - `a[1] = a[0] + T[0]`
     - `a[2] = a[1] + T[1]`
     - ...
     - `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + T[n-2]`

3. **Constructing the `result` String:**
   - The `result` string is created by joining all elements of `a` with spaces.
   - For example, if `a` is `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]`, then `result` will be `"a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[n-1]"`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of `a[0]` and `T` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[n-1] (where a[0] is the first element of `a`, and each subsequent element a[i] is the sum of the previous element a[i-1] and the corresponding element T[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1)**
