Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- The list `a` starts with the integer 1000. After each iteration of the loop, a new element is appended to `a`, which is the sum of the last element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. After all iterations, `a` will contain `n` elements: the initial 1000, followed by 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and so on, up to 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
- The variable `line` remains unchanged and is still the new string input.
- The list `T` remains unchanged and is still the list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The variable `i` is now `n` - 1, as the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `result` is a string that contains all the elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.
