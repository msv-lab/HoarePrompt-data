Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 500. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `n` - 1, `n` is the same as the initial input, `a` has `n` elements, where each new element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
