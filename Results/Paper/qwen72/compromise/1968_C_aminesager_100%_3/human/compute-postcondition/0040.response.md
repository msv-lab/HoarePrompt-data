Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` has a new element appended which is the sum of `a[1]` and `T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is the sum of `a[1]` and `T[1]` because `i` is 2, and `i - 1` is 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` has a new element appended which is the sum of `a[0]` and `T[0]` is still valid, but now an additional element has been appended based on the new code.
