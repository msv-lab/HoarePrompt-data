Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
   - `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]` (but `n` is now 0).
   - Additionally, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding the Values:**
   - Since `n` is 0, the expression `n - k + 1` simplifies to `-k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
     - `n` is 0, so `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 (since any number divided by 0 is undefined, but here `1 - k` is not 0).
     - `0 // 1` is 0.
   - Thus, `h` is `0 + 0 = 0`.
   - However, the precondition states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. This implies that `k` must be 0 or less, but since `h` is 0, `k` must also be 0 to satisfy the condition `h >= k`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is simply `print('YES')`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n`, `h`, `k`, and `costs` because it does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
