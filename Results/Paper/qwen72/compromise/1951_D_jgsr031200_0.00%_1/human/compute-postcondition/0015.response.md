Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
3. `costs` is initially `[n - k + 1, 1]`, but `n` is now 0.
4. The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`**: `n` is explicitly given as 0.
2. **Value of `costs`**: Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.
3. **Value of `h`**: `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`. Since `n` is 0, the quotient of 0 divided by any non-zero number is 0. Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 divided by each element in `costs`, which is:
   - \( \frac{0}{-k + 1} = 0 \)
   - \( \frac{0}{1} = 0 \)
   - So, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.
4. **Condition on `h`**: The current value of `h` is less than `k`. Since `h` is 0, this condition is true for any positive integer `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of `n`, `h`, and `costs` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is a static string.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
