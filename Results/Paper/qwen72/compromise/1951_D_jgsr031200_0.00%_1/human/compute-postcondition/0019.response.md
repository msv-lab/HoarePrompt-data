Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
- `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]` (but `n` is now 0).
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `costs`:**
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Given `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Simplifying, `costs` becomes `[1 - k, 1]`.

2. **Determine the value of `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n` is 0, any division of 0 by any non-zero number will result in 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 divided by each element in `costs`, which is `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - This means `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Check the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`:**
   - Given `h` is 0, the condition `h >= k` implies `0 >= k`.
   - This condition is only true if `k` is 0 or negative. However, since `k` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, we will assume `k` is a positive integer for the sake of this analysis.

4. **Final value of `costs`:**
   - `costs` remains `[1 - k, 1]`.

### Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list separated by a space. Given the initial state, the `costs` list is `[1 - k, 1]`.

Output: **1 - k, 1 (where k is a positive integer)**
