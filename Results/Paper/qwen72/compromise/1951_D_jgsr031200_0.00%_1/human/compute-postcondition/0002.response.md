The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. However, the `print` statement does not use these variables or any other objects; it simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
