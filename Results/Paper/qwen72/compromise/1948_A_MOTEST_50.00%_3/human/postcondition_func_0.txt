The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of uppercase Latin letters. If `n` is even, the string consists of the first `n // 2` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. If `n` is odd, the string starts with 'AAA' and is followed by the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console.
