Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should handle a list of test cases, where each test case is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and the function should generate a suitable string of uppercase Latin letters or report that no such string exists. The console is cleared. `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `ans`, `x`, or `j`. If `n` is even and not equal to 1, `ans` is the string 'AABBCC...XY' (where the length of `ans` is `n`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and not equal to 1, `ans` is the string 'ABBACCDD...EE' (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1 and even, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1 and odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAABBCC...CC' (where 'C' is repeated `n // 2 - 1` times), and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1 and even, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1 and odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAABBCC...CC' (where 'C' is repeated `n // 2 - 1` times), and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. If `n` is greater than 1 and even, `ans` is the string formed by repeating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` twice, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1 and not divisible by 2, `ans` is 'AAABBB' followed by the first `n // 2 - 2` letters of `s` each repeated twice, `x` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
