Postcondition: ***`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `ans`, `x`, or `j`. If `n` is even and not equal to 1, `ans` is the string 'AABBCC...XY' (where the length of `ans` is `n`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and not equal to 1, `ans` is the string 'ABBACCDD...EE' (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
