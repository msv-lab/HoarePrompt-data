Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to calculate and print a series of values representing the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their positions and the number of such characters encountered so far. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` contain the computed values and indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. The function does not return any value, but it prints a sequence of integers to the console. **
