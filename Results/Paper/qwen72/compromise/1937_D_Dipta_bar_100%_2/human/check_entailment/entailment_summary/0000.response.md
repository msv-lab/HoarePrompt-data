### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The function `func_1` preprocesses the string `s` to create two lists, `A` and `B`, which store the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively, along with their indices in `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
   - The list `A` is built by iterating from left to right, and the list `B` is built by iterating from right to left. This is necessary to handle the pinball movement in both directions.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each cell `i` in the string `s`, the program determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The program uses the precomputed lists `A` and `B` to calculate the time based on the direction of the pinball and the positions of the '>' and '<' characters.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball is placed on the first or last cell correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball moves in a single direction (all '<' or all '>') correctly.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The preprocessing step (building `A` and `B`) is done in O(n) time for each test case.
   - The query handling step is also done in O(n) time for each test case.
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query in the correct format, as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It preprocesses the string efficiently and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell correctly.

Correctness: **True**
