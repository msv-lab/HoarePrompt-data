### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the grid string `s` as an argument.
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of pinballs starting from the left and right, respectively.

3. **Left to Right Movement (`A` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '>', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `A` and the positions stored in `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated as the sum of the previous cumulative movement plus the distance from the last '>' to the current cell, multiplied by the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - The position `i` of each '>' is stored in `idx_A`.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently computes the cumulative movements for '>' characters.

4. **Right to Left Movement (`B` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '<', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated similarly to the left to right movement, but in reverse.
   - The position `i` of each '<' is stored in `idx_B`.
   - This part of the code is also correct and efficiently computes the cumulative movements for '<' characters.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` of the grid to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.
   - The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks is complex but appears to be correct. It correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves left or right and adjusts the cumulative movements accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell `i` in the grid.
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each time separated by a space.

### Detailed Analysis of the Query Processing:

- **Case 1: `s[i] == '>'`**
  - If `l < r`, the program calculates the time using the cumulative movements from `A` and `B`.
  - If `r == 0`, the pinball moves to the right and leaves the grid in `n - i` seconds.
  - If `r > 0`, the program calculates the time by adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.
  - The logic here is correct and ensures that the pinball's movements are accurately tracked.

- **Case 2: `s[i] == '<'`**
  - If `l <= r`, the program calculates the time using the cumulative movements from `A` and `B`.
  - If `l == 0`, the pinball moves to the left and leaves the grid in `i + 1` seconds.
  - If `l > 0`, the program calculates the time by adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.
  - The logic here is also correct and ensures that the pinball's movements are accurately tracked.

### Potential Issues and Improvements:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle the edge case where `n == 1`. However, this case is implicitly handled correctly because if `n == 1`, the pinball will leave the grid immediately, and the program will output `1` for both '>' and '<'.
  
- **Code Readability:**
  - The logic in the `elif` and `else` blocks is complex and could be simplified for better readability. However, the current implementation is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

- **Performance:**
  - The program is efficient and should handle the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) within a reasonable time. The use of precomputed cumulative movements in `A` and `B` helps in reducing the complexity of the query processing.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and adjusting them based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' is sound. The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
