You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to calculate and print a series of values representing the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their positions and the number of such characters encountered so far. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` contain the computed values and indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. The function does not return any value, but it prints a sequence of integers to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the grid string `s` as an argument.
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of pinballs starting from the left and right, respectively.

3. **Left to Right Movement (`A` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '>', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `A` and the positions stored in `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated as the sum of the previous cumulative movement plus the distance from the last '>' to the current cell, multiplied by the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - The position `i` of each '>' is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Right to Left Movement (`B` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '<', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated similarly to the left to right movement, but in reverse.
   - The position `i` of each '<' is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` of the grid to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell `i` in the grid.
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each time separated by a space.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and adjusting them based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' is sound.
- The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required.

However, there are a few potential issues and improvements to consider:
- The program does not handle edge cases where the grid length `n` is 1, which should be straightforward (the pinball leaves immediately).
- The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks could be simplified and made more readable.
- The program could be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve performance.

Despite these minor issues, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
