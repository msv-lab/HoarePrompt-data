Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative movements of the pinball for '>' and '<' directions, respectively. It also initializes `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - **Processing '>' Characters**:
     - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative movement and appends it to `A`.
     - It also appends the index of the '>' character to `idx_A`.
   - **Processing '<' Characters**:
     - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative movement and appends it to `B`.
     - It also appends the index of the '<' character to `idx_B`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program iterates over each cell in the grid and determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the direction of the character at that cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to efficiently calculate the time for each query.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex but correctly handles the different scenarios based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters and their cumulative movements.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each query in the correct format, as required by the problem description.

The program is designed to handle the constraints efficiently and correctly computes the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell. Therefore, the program is correct.
