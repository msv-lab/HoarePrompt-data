You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that it should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers should satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function should also handle an input integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions provided in the loop. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be read from input for each iteration, and the loop will continue to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of the loop will be that all `t` test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding results printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)` respectively.

2. **First Condition:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move up, and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet.
   - This condition is correct because if Alice's chip is in a row below Bob's chip, Alice cannot move up, and Bob cannot move down, so they will never be able to occupy the same cell.

3. **Second Condition:**
   - If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which is the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move towards each other.
   - The program then checks if the difference in their initial positions is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`):
     - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice can potentially move to meet Bob.
     - It then checks if Alice can move to a column within this range in `x + 1` moves. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.
     - This logic is based on the idea that if the number of rows between them is odd, Alice will have the last move, and she can win if she can move to a column where Bob is or will be.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob can potentially move to meet Alice.
   - It then checks if Bob can move to a column within this range in `x` moves. If so, Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.
     - This logic is based on the idea that if the number of rows between them is even, Bob will have the last move, and he can win if he can move to a column where Alice is or will be.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Draw Condition:**
  - If `xa > xb`, the game is correctly identified as a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down.
  - If `xa <= xb` and the difference in rows is even, the game is correctly identified as a draw if Bob cannot move to a column where Alice is or will be.

- **Win Conditions:**
  - If `xa <= xb` and the difference in rows is odd, the program correctly identifies Alice as the winner if she can move to a column where Bob is or will be.
  - If `xa <= xb` and the difference in rows is even, the program correctly identifies Bob as the winner if he can move to a column where Alice is or will be.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies when the game will end in a draw and when either Alice or Bob will win based on their initial positions and the rules of the game.

### Correctness:
**True**
