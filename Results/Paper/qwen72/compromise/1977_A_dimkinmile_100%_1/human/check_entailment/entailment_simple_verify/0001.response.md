### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `kreker` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes added or removed.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary because you cannot have a negative number of moves to achieve a positive number of cubes.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function `func_1()` is called `kreker` times, which is correct.
  - The function should take no parameters, as it reads `n` and `m` from the input within the function itself.

- **State inside `func_1()`**:
  - `n` and `m` are correctly assigned the values from the input, which is a space-separated string of two integers.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is correctly implemented.
  - If both conditions are true, the program prints "Yes".
  - If either condition is false, the program prints "No".

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative)
  - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (negative)
  - Output: "No" (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative)
  - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions checked are appropriate and the outputs for the given test cases are correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
