Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly. The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a runtime error. The correct order should be to define `func_1` before the loop that calls it. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem description. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` does not correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will output "No" when it should output "Yes" because Nikita can put a cube and then remove it, or just put a cube once. The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure that the number of moves is sufficient and the parity is correct.
