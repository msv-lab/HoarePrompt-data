Postcondition: **The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function can handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are now assigned the values from the input, which is a space-separated string of two integers. The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, meaning `n - m` is even and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.**
