The only objects in the loop head are the variable `p` and the list `out`. The loop iterates over the sorted `out` list, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `out` must have at least one more element after the current element `p`.

At the end of the last iteration, `out` must have at least one element, and `p` is the first element in the sorted `out`. For the loop to execute one more time, `out` must have at least two elements, and `p` will be the second element in the sorted `out`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list containing all the keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started, and the values of these keys in `player` are now `[-1, -1]`. The values of other keys in `player` that were not equal to `blud` remain unchanged, `out` must have at least two elements, `p` is the second element in the sorted `out`**
