Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field (n, m) and reads the initial state of the field. It identifies the positions of the goals (RG, BG), the Quaffle (.Q), the Bludger (.B), and the players (R0-R9, B0-B9).
   - The initial state of the game is correctly stored in the `player`, `rg`, `bg`, `ball`, and `blud` variables.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program processes each step of the game, correctly parsing the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - For the action 'C' (catch), it sets the `carry` variable to the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - For the action 'T' (throw), it sets the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
   - For the action 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' (move), it calls `func_1` to update the position of the entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) and `func_2` to handle any eliminations.

3. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction provided. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the entity's position accordingly.
   - The comments indicate that the function correctly modifies the `obj` list to reflect the new position.

4. **Elimination Function (`func_2`):**
   - The function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger. It appends the eliminated players to the `out` list and sets their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
   - It prints the elimination events in the correct format and order (alphabetical by player ID).
   - The comments indicate that the function correctly handles the elimination process and updates the player positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the events (goals and eliminations) in the correct format and order.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score in the correct format.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - It also correctly handles the case where multiple players are eliminated by the Bludger in the same step, ensuring that the eliminations are printed in alphabetical order.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
