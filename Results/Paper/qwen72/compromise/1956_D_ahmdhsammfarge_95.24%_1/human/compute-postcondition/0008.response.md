Output State: **`lst` is updated such that the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is now a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The variables `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged, and `n` is still equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.**

Explanation:
- The sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced with a new list containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`.
- The variables `r`, `l`, and `ops` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The value of `n` remains the same, which is `l - r + 1`.
- The condition about the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains valid, but the exact changes (if any) due to the function's operation are unknown.
