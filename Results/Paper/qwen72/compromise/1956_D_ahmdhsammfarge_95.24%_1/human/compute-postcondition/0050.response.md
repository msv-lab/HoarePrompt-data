The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18).
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n - (n - 2) + 1)`.
- If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `len(lst)`, which is `n`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is `n + 1`.
- However, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`, which is `n`.

Since `j` is now `n + 1`, it is out of the range, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last iteration if `j` were within the range) is:

State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n - (n - 2) + 1)`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**
