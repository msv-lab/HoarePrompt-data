The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the operation parameters. The function returns the updated list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` consists of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.
