Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18).
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- The new value of `sm` is calculated as the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2` or `4 ** 2` which is `16`.
- If the new value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n`, and `over_sum` is updated to the new value of `sm`.
