Postcondition: ***`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1)`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.***
