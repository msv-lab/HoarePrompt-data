Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2].**

Explanation:
- `sm` is recalculated as the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9 (since `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `(3 - 1 + 1) ** 2` which equals 9).
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if sm > over_sum` remains the same, and if it is true, `over_sum` is updated to the new value of `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2].
- The length of `lst` and the initial state of `lst` remain unchanged.
