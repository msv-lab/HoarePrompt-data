Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the strategy to maximize the sum of the array elements. Here are a few issues:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of the selected subarray. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the sum by replacing subarrays with the square of their length, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Operation Limit**: The program does not ensure that the operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times. The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` can lead to an excessive number of operations.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required. It only returns the modified list and the operations list, but it does not print the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already optimal (like in the second example where the initial sum is 13), the program should output 0 operations, but it does not do that.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  3
  1 3 9
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  13 0
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and does not handle the case where no operations are needed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
