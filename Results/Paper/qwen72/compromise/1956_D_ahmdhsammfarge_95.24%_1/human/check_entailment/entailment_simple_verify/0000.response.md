Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues and validate them using the annotated code:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the MEX of the selected subarray. Instead, it calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray and adds the square of the subarray length. This is not the correct approach to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum. However, it incorrectly calculates the potential new sum as `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is not the MEX, but rather the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray length.

2. **Operation Limit**:
   - The program does not ensure that the operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times. The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` can lead to an excessive number of operations.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` both have recursive calls that can potentially double the number of operations for each subarray, leading to a combinatorial explosion in the number of operations.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required. It only returns the modified list and the operations list, but it does not print the required output format.
   - The main part of the program does print the sum and the number of operations, but the operations themselves are not correctly generated due to the issues in `func_2` and `func_3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already optimal (like in the second example where the initial sum is 13), the program should output 0 operations, but it does not do that.
   - In the provided example:
     - **Input**:
       ```
       3
       1 3 9
       ```
     - **Expected Output**:
       ```
       13 0
       ```
     - **Actual Output**: The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and does not handle the case where no operations are needed.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
