Reasoning:

1. **func_1**: This function is responsible for finding the optimal subarray `[r, l]` to perform the MEX operation on, such that the sum of the array after the operation is maximized. The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX value. The MEX value is assumed to be the length of the subarray, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. The function correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum and returns the indices `r` and `l`.

2. **func_2**: This function is designed to generate a sequence of operations to transform the subarray `[r, l]` into a form where all elements are equal to the MEX value. However, the function's logic is flawed. It recursively appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to the transformation of the array. The function should only append the operation once, and the recursive calls should be avoided as they lead to redundant operations.

3. **func_3**: This function performs the actual MEX operation on the subarray `[r, l]` and updates the `ops` list with the operation details. It correctly appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and updates the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to consist of `n` elements, each equal to `n` (where `n` is the length of the subarray). However, the function also appends additional operations that are not necessary for the transformation, such as `[r + 1, r + 1]` and redundant `[r + 1, l + 1]` operations. These extra operations do not contribute to the goal of maximizing the sum and can be considered incorrect.

4. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the program correctly uses `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then applies `func_3` to perform the MEX operation. It continues this process until no further improvements can be made. After that, it attempts to replace any remaining zeros with ones, which is a valid step to maximize the sum. However, the use of `func_2` and the additional operations in `func_3` introduce unnecessary steps and potentially incorrect behavior.

Given the issues in `func_2` and the unnecessary operations in `func_3`, the program does not meet the problem description efficiently and correctly. The program should only perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum without adding redundant or incorrect steps.

Correctness: **False**
