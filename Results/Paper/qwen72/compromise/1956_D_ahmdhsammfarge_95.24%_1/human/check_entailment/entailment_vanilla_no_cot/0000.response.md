Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, but the program is using the length of the subarray squared as a heuristic, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the optimal subarray to apply the MEX operation, but it is using a sum-based heuristic that does not align with the MEX operation's goal.
   - The function `func_2` and `func_3` are not correctly applying the MEX operation. They are appending operations to the list without actually computing the MEX and updating the array accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations. Instead, it only returns the indices of a subarray and modifies the operations list, but it does not compute the final sum or the number of operations used.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` are not properly structured to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum. The operations are being appended in a way that does not guarantee the correct MEX value is being used.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Calculate the MEX**:
   - For each subarray, compute the MEX correctly by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.

2. **Apply the MEX Operation**:
   - Apply the MEX operation to the subarray and update the array elements accordingly.

3. **Track the Maximum Sum**:
   - Keep track of the maximum sum achieved and the sequence of operations that led to this sum.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Output the maximum sum and the number of operations used, followed by the sequence of operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in seen:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def maximize_sum(n, a):
    max_sum = sum(a)
    operations = []
    
    for l in range(n):
        for r in range(l, n):
            subarray = a[l:r+1]
            mex_value = mex(subarray)
            new_subarray = [mex_value] * (r - l + 1)
            new_sum = sum(a[:l]) + sum(new_subarray) + sum(a[r+1:])
            if new_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = new_sum
                operations = [(l, r)]
                a[l:r+1] = new_subarray
    
    print(max_sum, len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0] + 1, op[1] + 1)

# Example usage:
n = 4
a = [1, 100, 2, 1]
maximize_sum(n, a)
```

This program correctly calculates the MEX, applies the operation, and tracks the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
