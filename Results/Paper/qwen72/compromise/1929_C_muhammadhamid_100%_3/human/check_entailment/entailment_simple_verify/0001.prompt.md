You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - He can place a bet of `y` coins, where `y` is a positive integer and `y <= a`.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The problem can be approached by considering the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins once. This cycle can be repeated to ensure that Sasha can always recover and eventually reach any number of coins `n`.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - Let's analyze the worst-case scenario:
     - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
     - He loses `x` times in a row, each time betting the maximum possible amount that does not exceed his current coins.
     - After `x` losses, he will have `a - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x)` coins left.
     - The sum of the first `x` positive integers is given by the formula: \( \text{sum} = \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} \).
     - Therefore, after `x` losses, Sasha will have \( a - \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} \) coins left.
     - If he wins the next bet, his coins will increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \), where `y` is the amount he bet.
     - To ensure he can always recover, the amount he bets after `x` losses should be such that he can still win and recover his losses.

4. **Strategy:**
   - Sasha should bet in a way that ensures he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The minimum amount he should have after `x` losses to guarantee a win is 1 coin.
   - Therefore, the minimum initial amount `a` should be such that after `x` losses, he still has at least 1 coin left.
   - This can be expressed as: \( a \geq \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The loop `for i in range(x):` simulates the process of losing `x` times in a row.
   - The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the recovery process after `x` losses.
   - The final check `print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')` determines if Sasha has enough initial coins to guarantee he can always recover.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program's logic is correct in simulating the worst-case scenario and ensuring that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - However, the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is not the most straightforward way to calculate the minimum initial amount `a` required.
   - A more direct approach would be to use the formula \( a \geq \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is correct in simulating the worst-case scenario and ensuring that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses. However, the implementation is not the most efficient or straightforward. Despite this, the program will produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
