Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 1, `s` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = 1` resets the value of `s` to 1. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `x` still holds true.
