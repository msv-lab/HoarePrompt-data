Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within specified ranges. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` starting from 1 and iteratively updates it `x` times using the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After the calculation, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
