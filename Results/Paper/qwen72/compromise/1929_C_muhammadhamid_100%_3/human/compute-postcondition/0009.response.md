Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 0, `s` is the value of `s` after `x` iterations of the loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration, `i` is `x - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `k` remains an integer between 2 and 30.
- The variable `x` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `a` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
- The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `s` starts at 1 and is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration of the loop. After `x` iterations, `s` will have the final value resulting from these increments.
- The loop variable `i` will be `x - 1` after the loop has completed all `x` iterations.
