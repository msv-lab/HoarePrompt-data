Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 2, `s` is 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1), `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `s` is 1.
- The expression `s // (k - 1)` calculates the integer division of `s` by `k - 1`.
- Since `s` is 1, `1 // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any integer `k` greater than 1.
- Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `x` still holds.
