You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`), or there exists at least one character in `a` that is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different. If `possible` is False, it indicates that all characters in `c` are equal to the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` (and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
       - It further checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`.
       - If `c[i]` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
       - It checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
       - If `c[i]` is equal to either, it continues to the next position.
       - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES".
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - For the template to be valid, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` is different, the template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be either an uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
  - For the template to be valid, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` is different from both, the template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

- **Case 3: `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the template cannot be constructed for this position, and the function continues to the next position.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]` and `c[0] != a[0]` and `c[0] != b[0]`, so the template can be "A" or "B".
  - Output: "YES"

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]` but `c[0] == a[0]`, so the template cannot be constructed for position 0.
  - Output: "NO"

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - At position 0, `a[0] == 'm'`, `b[0] == 'l'`, and `c[0] == 'a'`. Since `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the template can be constructed.
  - Output: "YES"

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - At position 0, `a[0] == 'a'`, `b[0] == 'a'`, and `c[0] == 'a'`. Since `c[0]` is the same as `a[0]`, the template cannot be constructed for position 0.
  - Output: "NO"

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The conditions and checks are correctly applied, and the output is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
