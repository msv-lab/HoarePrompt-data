Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` retains its original value.***
