Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
