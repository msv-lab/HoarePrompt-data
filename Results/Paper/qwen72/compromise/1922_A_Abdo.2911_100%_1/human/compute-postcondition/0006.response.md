Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `possible` is False.** 

The variable `possible` is now set to `False`, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
