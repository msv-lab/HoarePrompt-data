The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are used and modified within the loop.

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is set to True or False based on the conditions described in the task.**
