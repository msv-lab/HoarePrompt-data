The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns the result of some operation based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.
