Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code snippet `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition for `possible` being set to `True` or `False` based on the first characters of `a`, `b`, and `c` is overridden by this assignment, so `possible` is now explicitly `True`. The value of `i` remains 1.
