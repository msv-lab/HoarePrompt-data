Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` and `b`, `possible` is set to True. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` remains False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True.***
