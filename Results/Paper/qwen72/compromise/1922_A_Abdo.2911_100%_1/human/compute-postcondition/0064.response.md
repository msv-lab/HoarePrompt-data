Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0. If the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `b` (and not equal to the first character of `a`), `possible` remains False. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`.***
