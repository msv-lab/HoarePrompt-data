Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `b`. If the first element of `c` is equal to the first element of `a` or the first element of `b`, `possible` remains False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
