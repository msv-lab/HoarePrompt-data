Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` and `b`, `possible` is set to True. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` remains False. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
