The value of `a` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, where `input()` accepts an input from the user and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and `n` is still an input integer. The state of `a` is updated to the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed.**
