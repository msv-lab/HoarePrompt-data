Output State: **a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. n is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a). left is a list containing the integer 0. last is a list containing the integer -1. ans is a list of length n, where each element is -1.**

The code initializes a new list `ans` with a length equal to `n` (the length of list `a`), and each element in `ans` is set to -1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) remain unchanged.
