Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, `i` is 3, and `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, 2, and 3 if \(a[2] \neq a[1]\), otherwise `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, -1, and 3.**
