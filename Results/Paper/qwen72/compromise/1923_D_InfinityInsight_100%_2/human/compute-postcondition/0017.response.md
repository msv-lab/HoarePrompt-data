Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` is \(n-1\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`a`**: This list remains unchanged from the initial state. It still contains integers within the specified range.
- **`n`**: This is the length of the list `a` and remains unchanged.
- **`left`**: This list also remains unchanged, still containing only the integer 0.
- **`last`**: The list `last` starts with -1 and then, for each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it appends the index \(i\) if \(a[i]\) is different from \(a[i-1]\). If \(a[i]\) is the same as \(a[i-1]\), it appends the last index stored in `last` (which is the last occurrence of the current element in `a` up to that point).
- **`ans`**: This list remains unchanged, with all elements still set to -1.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be \(n-1\), which is the last index of the list `a`.

In essence, the `last` list will track the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` as the loop progresses through the list.
