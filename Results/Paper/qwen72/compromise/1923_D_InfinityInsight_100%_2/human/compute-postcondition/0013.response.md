The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` is 3. If \(a[2] \neq a[1]\), `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and -1.**
