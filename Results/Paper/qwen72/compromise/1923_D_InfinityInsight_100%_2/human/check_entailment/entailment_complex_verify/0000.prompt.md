You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index returned by `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.
The first element of `ans` remains -1. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where a slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than the neighbor. Additionally, the program does not simulate the process of slimes eating each other over time, which is a key requirement of the problem. The program seems to be attempting to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, but it does not correctly account for the dynamic changes in the sizes of the slimes as they eat each other.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
3 2 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 1 -1
```
However, the program will produce an incorrect output because it does not simulate the process of slimes eating each other correctly. The 1st slime (size 3) can eat the 2nd slime (size 2) in the first second, and then the 1st slime (now size 5) can eat the 3rd slime (size 3) in the second second. The 2nd slime is eaten in 1 second, and the 3rd slime is eaten in 2 seconds. The 1st slime is never eaten, so its output should be -1. The program does not capture this behavior correctly.
