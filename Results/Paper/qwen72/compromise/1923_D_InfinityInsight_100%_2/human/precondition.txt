t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer representing the number of slimes in each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers representing the sizes of the slimes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
