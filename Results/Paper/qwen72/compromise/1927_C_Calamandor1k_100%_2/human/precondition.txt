t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k. n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, respectively, and k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)) representing the number of elements to be chosen. Each test case is followed by two lists of integers, a and b, of lengths n and m, respectively, where each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6). The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
