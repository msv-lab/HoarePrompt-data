### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It converts the arrays `a` and `b` to sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to get the unique elements in each array.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` is the set of elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

4. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results because it is not possible to choose enough elements from `a` to satisfy the condition.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results because it is not possible to choose enough elements from `b` to satisfy the condition.
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If this total is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results because not all integers from 1 to `k` are covered.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for determining whether it is possible to choose the required elements is sound.
- The conditions for checking the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and the total distinct elements are appropriate and cover the necessary cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
