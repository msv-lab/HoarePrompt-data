The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000, representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The integers `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 200,000, `k` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 times the minimum of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b` contain integers within the range 1 to 1,000,000. The function returns a list of strings, `results`, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether certain conditions were met for each tuple in `cases`. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions for each tuple were met. The length of the returned list is equal to the number of tuples in `cases`.**
