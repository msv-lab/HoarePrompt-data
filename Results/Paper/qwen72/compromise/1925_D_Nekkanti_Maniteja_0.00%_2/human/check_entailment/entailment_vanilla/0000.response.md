### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The teacher chooses `k` pairs of children randomly, and if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen, and output this value as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends plus the expected number of new pairs of friends chosen.

3. **Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends is \( a \).

4. **Expected Increase in Friendship Values:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times k \).

5. **Sum of Friendship Values Over `k` Excursions:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{m \times k \times (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
     \]

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - We need to compute the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) is used to compute the division in modular arithmetic.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions, adding the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

8. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values. It should be:
     \[
     s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a
     \]
   - The program uses `c * i * c * m` which is incorrect. It should be `c * m * (i + 1)` to correctly account for the expected increase in each excursion.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a \) instead of \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).
