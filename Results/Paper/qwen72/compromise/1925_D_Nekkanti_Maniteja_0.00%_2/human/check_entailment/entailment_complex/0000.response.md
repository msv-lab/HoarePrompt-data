Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.
2. **Modulo Calculation**: The function uses \(10^9 + 7\) as the modulo value, which is correct as specified in the problem.
3. **Probability Calculation**: The function calculates the probability \(c\) of choosing a specific pair of children as \( \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \) using modular inverse. This is correct because the total number of pairs of children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \). However, the function simplifies this to \( \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \), which is incorrect. The correct probability should be \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
4. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The function initializes `a` to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values and `s` to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over all excursions. This is correct.
5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The function attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. However, the formula used in the loop is incorrect. The correct formula should account for the probability of choosing a friend pair and the increasing friendship value over each excursion.

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is:
\[ \text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot (f + i) \right) \]
where \( f \) is the sum of initial friendship values.

The function should be modified to use the correct probability and formula.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        # Correct probability of choosing a specific pair of friends
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        # Sum of initial friendship values
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Calculate the expected sum of friendship values
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        
        print(s)
```

Explanation of the corrections:
- **Probability Calculation**: Changed `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` to `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to correctly calculate the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: Changed the loop to correctly accumulate the expected value using the formula \( \text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot (f + i) \right) \). This ensures that the friendship value increases correctly over each excursion.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each test case.
