Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 1000000007.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the result of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 1000000007. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged.
