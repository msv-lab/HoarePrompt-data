The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is `s + c * c * m + c * a`**
