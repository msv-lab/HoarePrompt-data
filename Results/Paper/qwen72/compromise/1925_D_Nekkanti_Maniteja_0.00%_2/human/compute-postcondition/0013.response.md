Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is increased by `f`**

Explanation:
- The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user, which are split and converted to integers.
- The variable `a` is still described as being increased by `f`, but the specific value of `a` is not provided, so this part of the state remains as a description.
