Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- The modular multiplicative inverse of a number `x` modulo `M` is a number `y` such that `(x * y) % M = 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `a`, `s`, `n`, `M`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
