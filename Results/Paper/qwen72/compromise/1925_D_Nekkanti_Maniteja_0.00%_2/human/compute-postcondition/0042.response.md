The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`**
