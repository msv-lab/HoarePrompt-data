Output State: **`i` is `k`, `m` is the second input integer, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the third input integer, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `k` must be less than `m`, `s` is increased by the sum of `c * (m-1 + j) * c * m + c * a` for `j` from `0` to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.
- `m` is now the second input integer.
- `u` is now the first input integer.
- `v` is now the third input integer.
- The initial state mentions that `i` is `k`, and this remains unchanged.
- The initial state also mentions that `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, and this remains unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be less than `m` remains valid.
- The initial state mentions that `s` is increased by the sum of `c * (m-1 + j) * c * m + c * a` for `j` from `0` to `k`, and this remains unchanged.
