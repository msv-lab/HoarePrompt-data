The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is `m - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
