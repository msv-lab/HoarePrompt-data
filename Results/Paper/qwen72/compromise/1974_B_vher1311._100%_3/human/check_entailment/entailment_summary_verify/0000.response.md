### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, handling multiple test cases.
   - The index `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Auxiliary String `r`**:
     - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` and constructs the auxiliary string `r` by first creating a set of unique characters from `b` and then sorting these characters in alphabetical order.
     - This step is correct as it ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - **Mapping Creation**:
     - The mapping is created by pairing each character in `r` with its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character with the last, the second with the second last, etc.).
     - This is done using a dictionary comprehension: `{r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`.
     - This step is also correct as it follows the problem description for creating the symmetric mapping.
   - **Decoding**:
     - The function then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding value from the mapping.
     - This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method: `''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))`.
     - This step is correct as it applies the mapping to each character in the encoded string to produce the decoded string.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of all test cases in a list `results` and prints them separated by newlines.
   - This is consistent with the problem description, which requires the output to be the original string for each test case.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The function `func_1` correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` and the symmetric mapping.
- The decoding process is implemented correctly, ensuring that each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart.
- The program handles multiple test cases and ensures that the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed the constraints.

### Final:
**True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` for each test case, following the problem description and constraints.
