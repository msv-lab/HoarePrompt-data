### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the modulus value `m`.
   - It then reads the array `arr` and the command string `s`.

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 1 and multiplies it by each element of the array `arr`. This calculates the product of all elements in the array.
   - The product is then taken modulo `m` and stored in `res[0]`. This is correct, but the additional modulo `MOD` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Command Processing:**
   - The function uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array.
   - For each command in the string `s`, it updates the product `ans` by dividing it by the appropriate element (either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]`), and then takes the result modulo `m` and stores it in the result list `res`.
   - The pointers `l` and `r` are updated accordingly to reflect the removal of the element.
   - However, the division operation `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` is incorrect. The division should be performed without the modulo `MOD` to ensure the product is correctly updated. The modulo `m` should be applied only once after the division.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the result list `res`.

### Issues:

1. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The function uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it to the product `ans` multiple times. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the problem only requires the modulo `m`.

2. **Division and Modulo:**
   - The division operation `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` is incorrect. The correct operation should be `ans //= arr[l]` and `ans //= arr[r]` to ensure the product is correctly updated.
   - The modulo operation should be applied only once after the division to get the correct remainder.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans //= arr[l]
                res[k + 1] = ans % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans //= arr[r]
                res[k + 1] = ans % m
                r -= 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program addresses the issues mentioned above and should now correctly process the commands and output the remainders as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the unnecessary `MOD` and the incorrect division and modulo operations.
- The original program is incorrect due to these issues.

Final: **False**
