Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is 1, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input, `s` is a list of characters provided as input, and `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `i`, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input that must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters provided as input, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, `i` is the first element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `i * i`, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input that must have at least two elements, `s` is a list of characters provided as input, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, `i` is the second element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `i * i * i`, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input that must have at least three elements, `s` is a list of characters provided as input, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, `i` is the third element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
