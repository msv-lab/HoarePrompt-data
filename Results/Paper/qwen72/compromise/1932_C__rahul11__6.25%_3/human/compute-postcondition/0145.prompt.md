Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the array a, an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) for the modulus operation, a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) representing the elements of the array, and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `MOD` is now 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is the result of dividing `ans` by the elements of `arr` based on the characters in `s` and taking modulo `MOD`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` is `n - 1 - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all updates, `res` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` based on the conditions of `s[k]`, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, and `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the elements of `arr` based on the characters in `s` (from index 0 to `n-2`), and `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the subsequent elements are updated based on the division of `ans` by `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` and the characters in `s` (from index 0 to `n-2`), `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from index 0 to `n-2`, and `r` is `n - 1 - l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
