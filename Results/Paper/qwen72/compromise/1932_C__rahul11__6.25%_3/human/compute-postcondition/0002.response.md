The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `m`. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, which reads a new input and assigns it to `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (this condition is no longer directly relevant as a new input is taken).**
