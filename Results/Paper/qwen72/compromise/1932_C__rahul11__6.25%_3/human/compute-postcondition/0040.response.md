Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `c` is `c + 2`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2.**

The code snippet `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. The value of `c` is `c + 2`, and the value of `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The initial state of `res[c]` being `ans % m % MOD` is still valid, but it is now updated to the new value of `ans % m % MOD` after `ans` has been modified.
