Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 0. If the first element of `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the first element of `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decremented by 1.***
