Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `ans` remain as they were after the previous updates.
- The value of `res[c-1]` is also still `ans % m % MOD` as it was previously updated.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `res[c]`.
