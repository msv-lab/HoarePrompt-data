Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are updated based on the first element of `s` and the values of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` and `MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.***
