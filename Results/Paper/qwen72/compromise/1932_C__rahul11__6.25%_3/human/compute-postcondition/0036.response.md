Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, and `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`. If the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[1] % MOD` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, if the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is `r - 2`.***
