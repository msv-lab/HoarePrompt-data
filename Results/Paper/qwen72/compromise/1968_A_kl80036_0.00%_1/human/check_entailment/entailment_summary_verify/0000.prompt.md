You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, and prints the result of the integer division of `x` by 2. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not always find a `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized. For example, consider the case where `x = 10`. The program outputs `5`, but the maximum value of `gcd(10, y) + y` for `1 <= y < 10` is actually achieved when `y = 6` (since `gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8`, while `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10` is not the maximum possible value). The program always outputs `x // 2`, which is not guaranteed to maximize `gcd(x, y) + y` for all `x`.
