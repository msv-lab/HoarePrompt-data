### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for a given \( x \).

2. **GCD Analysis**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For \( y = x // 2 \), \( \gcd(x, y) \) is at least \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even, and \( 1 \) if \( x \) is odd.
   - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) will be a large divisor of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) will be the largest integer less than \( x \) that is not a divisor of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

3. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) = x // 2 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x // 2 + x // 2 = x \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + x // 2 \).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program always prints \( y = x // 2 \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is correct because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is also correct because it is the largest possible \( y \) that is less than \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), which is the best possible GCD for an odd \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
