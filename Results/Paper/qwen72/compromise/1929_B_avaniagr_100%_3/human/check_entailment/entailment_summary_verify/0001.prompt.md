You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n` x `n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value. After processing all input lines, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `k` are not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then determines the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - This condition is based on the observation that each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.

   - **Condition 2: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \), the program prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - This condition is based on the fact that to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, which results in \( 2n - 1 \) cells being colored.

   - **Condition 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( 2n \).
     - This condition is based on the fact that to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, plus one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered, which results in \( 2n \) cells being colored.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (4 <= 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 <= 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 2 \) (10 = 10), so the program prints \( 2n = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells are needed to cover all 10 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 3 \) (9 = 9), so the program prints \( 2n - 1 = 5 \).
     - This is correct because 5 cells are needed to cover 9 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (7 <= 12), so the program prints \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).
     - This is correct because 4 cells can cover 7 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (11 <= 24), so the program prints \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells can cover 11 diagonals.

   - **Test Case 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 <= 4), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
