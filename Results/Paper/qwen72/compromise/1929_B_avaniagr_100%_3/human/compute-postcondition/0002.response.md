The function `min_cells_to_color` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in the grid to satisfy the condition that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. It returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition.**
