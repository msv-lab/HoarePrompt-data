You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases, and for each test case, the output is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or the sum of `ans` and `p2` where `ans` is the sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b` and `p2` is `(n - k) * a` if `a < b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are unchanged, but the loop has completed its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, each between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` as the sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. It also calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. The function then prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all the potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Condition for Usual Price**: If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, Bob will sell all buns at the usual price `a` because it is more profitable. This is correctly handled by the line `if a >= b: print(n * a)`.

3. **Condition for Modified Price**: If `a` is less than `b`, Bob will choose the optimal `k` to maximize his profit. The program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range and maximizes the profit from the modified price.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` is calculated using the formula `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then printed as `print(ans + p2)`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the program correctly handles this by either selling the single bun at the usual price or the modified price, whichever is more profitable.
   - When `b` is 1, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price if `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and otherwise sells the single bun at the modified price.
   - When `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)), the program correctly calculates the profit without any issues.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
