Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, each between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` as the sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. It also calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. The function then prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain unchanged. **
