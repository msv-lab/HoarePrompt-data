The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will start from 0 as it is used in the `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0**
