### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - This part of the program is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative values for movements to the right and left, respectively.

3. **Array `A`**:
   - `A` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '>'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `>` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_A` that keeps track of the positions of `>`.
   - The logic for building `A` and `idx_A` is correct and matches the problem requirements.

4. **Array `B`**:
   - `B` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '<'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `<` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_B` that keeps track of the positions of `<`.
   - The logic for building `B` and `idx_B` is correct and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over each position `i` in the string `s` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current position `i` contains `>` or `<`, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios, such as the pinball moving to the left or right and the positions of the nearest `>` and `<`.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the complexity and the use of cumulative arrays and index lists to ensure efficient calculations.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the first or last cell and moves out of the grid immediately.
   - It also handles cases where there are no `<` or `>` in the string, ensuring that the pinball leaves the grid in the correct number of steps.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that these edge cases are handled.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `A` and `B` arrays.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the time and space complexity.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Setup**:
  - The program initializes `A` and `idx_A` for positions where `s[i] == '>'`.
  - It initializes `B` and `idx_B` for positions where `s[i] == '<'`.
  - These initializations are correct and align with the problem description.

- **Main Loop**:
  - The main loop iterates over each position `i` in the string `s`.
  - For each position `i`, it checks if `s[i] == '>'` or `s[i] == '<` and calculates the time accordingly.
  - The calculations involve using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` and adjusting for the positions of the nearest `>` and `<`.
  - The logic for these calculations is complex but appears to be correct based on the problem requirements and the annotated states.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where the pinball starts at the first or last cell and moves out of the grid immediately.
  - It also handles cases where there are no `<` or `>` in the string, ensuring the correct output.
  - The edge case handling is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative arrays and index lists ensures that the calculations are efficient and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
