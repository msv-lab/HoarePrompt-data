### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to systematically analyze the program's behavior based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The grid is a one-dimensional array of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball placed on the `i`-th cell will move left if `s_i` is '<' and right if `s_i` is '>'.
- After each move, the direction of the cell is inverted.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
- We need to answer `n` queries for each test case, where each query places a pinball on the `i`-th cell and computes the time it takes to leave the grid.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of a main loop that reads multiple test cases and calls the `func_1` function for each test case. The `func_1` function is responsible for computing and printing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` processes the string `s` to compute and print the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
- It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store intermediate values for cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
- It also uses `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of these cells.
- The function prints the results directly and does not return any values.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s)` to compute the results for the current test case.

2. **Processing the String:**
   - `func_1` initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting from '>' and '<' cells, respectively.
   - It also initializes `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of these cells.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Times:**
   - The first loop calculates the cumulative time for pinballs starting from '>' cells and appends these times to `A`.
   - The second loop calculates the cumulative time for pinballs starting from '<' cells and appends these times to `B`.

4. **Handling Each Cell:**
   - The program then iterates through each cell `i` and computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative times stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the current cell and using the appropriate cumulative times to compute the result.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case when the pinball is placed on the last cell and the last cell is '>'. Specifically, for the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2 1
```
However, the program outputs:
```
1 2 3
```
This is incorrect because the pinball placed on the last cell (3rd cell) should leave the grid immediately, taking 1 second, not 3 seconds.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the program's behavior for the specific input `">>>"`:
- For the first cell (1st cell), the pinball moves to the right and leaves the grid immediately. The program correctly outputs `1`.
- For the second cell (2nd cell), the pinball moves to the right, then the cell is inverted to '<', and it moves back to the right. The program correctly outputs `2`.
- For the third cell (3rd cell), the pinball should move to the right and leave the grid immediately. However, the program outputs `3`.

The issue lies in the logic for handling the last cell when it is '>'. The program does not correctly account for the immediate exit of the pinball from the grid when it is placed on the last cell and the last cell is '>'. This is a clear bug in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case when the pinball is placed on the last cell and the last cell is '>'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
