You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to compute and print a series of integers. Each integer represents a specific calculation based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are populated with intermediate values used in the calculations. The final state of the program includes the printed output and the populated lists, but the original string `s` is not modified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative values for movements to the right and left, respectively.

3. **Array `A`**:
   - `A` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '>'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `>` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_A` that keeps track of the positions of `>`.

4. **Array `B`**:
   - `B` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '<'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `<` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_B` that keeps track of the positions of `<`.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over each position `i` in the string `s` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current position `i` contains `>` or `<`, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios, such as the pinball moving to the left or right and the positions of the nearest `>` and `<`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the first or last cell and moves out of the grid immediately.
   - It also handles cases where there are no `<` or `>` in the string, ensuring that the pinball leaves the grid in the correct number of steps.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `A` and `B` arrays.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative arrays and index lists ensures that the calculations are efficient and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
