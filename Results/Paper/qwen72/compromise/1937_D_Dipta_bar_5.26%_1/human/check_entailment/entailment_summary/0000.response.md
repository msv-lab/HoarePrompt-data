### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute and print the results for each cell.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store intermediate results.
   - It also initializes two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The first loop populates `A` and `idx_A` for '>' characters.
   - The second loop populates `B` and `idx_B` for '<' characters.
   - The third loop calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell and prints the result.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **First Loop (for '>' characters):**
     - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the next '>' character and stores it in `A`.
     - It also stores the index of each '>' character in `idx_A`.
   - **Second Loop (for '<' characters):**
     - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the next '<' character and stores it in `B`.
     - It also stores the index of each '<' character in `idx_B`.
   - **Third Loop (for each cell):**
     - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve using the cumulative times stored in `A` and `B` and the indices stored in `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the grid contains only '>' or only '<' characters.
   - It also handles cases where the grid is of length 1.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each cell in the format specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules. The use of cumulative times and indices ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate for each cell. The program handles all edge cases and produces the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**
