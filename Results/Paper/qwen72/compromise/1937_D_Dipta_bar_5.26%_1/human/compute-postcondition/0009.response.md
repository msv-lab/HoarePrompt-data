Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '>' character, `idx_B` is a list of indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`, in reverse order, `l` is 0.** 

The variable `l` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
