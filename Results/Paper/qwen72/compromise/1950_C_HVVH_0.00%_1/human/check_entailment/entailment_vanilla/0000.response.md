Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled with `n = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times to process each test case. This is correctly implemented with `for _ in range(n):`.

3. **Splitting the Time**: For each test case, the program reads a string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into two integers `h` and `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`. This is correct as it converts the hour and minute parts into integers.

4. **Handling 12-Hour Format**:
   - If `h == 0`, the program sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h > 12`, the program sets `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format are converted to 1 to 11 in 12-hour format with 'PM'.
   - If `h <= 12`, the program sets `day` to 'PM' and then checks if `h == 12`. If `h == 12`, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is incorrect because hours from 1 to 11 in 24-hour format should be 'AM', and only 12 should be 'PM'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the time in the 12-hour format using `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)`. This is correct as it ensures the hour and minute are always two digits and includes the 'AM' or 'PM' part.

However, there is a logical error in the handling of the `day` variable. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours from 1 to 11, and then corrects it only if `h == 12`. This will result in incorrect outputs for hours from 1 to 11.

To fix this, the program should set `day` to 'AM' by default and only change it to 'PM' if `h >= 12`.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h = h - 12
        elif h == 0:
            h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given the logical error in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
