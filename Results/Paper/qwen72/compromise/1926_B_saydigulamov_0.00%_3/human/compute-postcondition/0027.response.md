The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and is incremented internally by the loop, we do not need to explicitly state its value. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a list. If the input string `b` contains the character '1', `k` contains the number of '1' characters in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list. `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `b` is the input string.**
