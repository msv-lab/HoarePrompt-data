### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of integers, and we can perform an operation that splits any integer in the array that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order (i.e., `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`).
   - If an out-of-order element is found and it is greater than 10, the program splits that element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function returns `True` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program only attempts to split the first out-of-order element it encounters. This is a significant issue because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it won't split `28` to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not recheck the array after each split to see if the array is sorted or if further splits are needed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the possibility of multiple splits being required to sort the array. It only attempts to split the first out-of-order element it finds, which is not sufficient to solve the problem in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
