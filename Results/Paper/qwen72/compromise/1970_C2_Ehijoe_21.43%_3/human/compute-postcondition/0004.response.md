The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n` should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True**
