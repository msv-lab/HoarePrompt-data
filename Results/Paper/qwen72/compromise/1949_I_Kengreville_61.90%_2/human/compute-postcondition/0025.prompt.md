Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists of integers or booleans, each of length n. The elements of `x` and `y` represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of `r` represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The list `visited` now has the value `True` at index `i`, indicating that the disk at index `i` has been visited in the DFS traversal. The lists `coef0` and `coef1` are unchanged. The list `nodes` now includes the integer `i`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[0]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and the sum of `r[i]` and `r[0]` squared is equal to the sum of `dx` squared and `dy` squared, then `visited[j]` is `True`, `coef0[j]` is equal to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is equal to `-coef1[i]`. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[1]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
