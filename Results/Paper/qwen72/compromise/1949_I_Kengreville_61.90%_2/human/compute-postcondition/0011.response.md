The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the condition that `n` must be greater than `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[0]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated or remain unchanged depending on the previous iteration's condition.**
