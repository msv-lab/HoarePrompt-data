Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains at least one more element after the current `j`, `j` is the next element in `nodes`, `ok` might be `True` or `False` depending on the specific condition within the `dfs` function, `c0` is 1, `c1` is 2 + coef1[j].**

Explanation:
- The value of `c1` is incremented by the value of `coef1[j]`.
- Initially, `c1` is 1 + `coef1[j]`.
- After the increment, `c1` becomes 1 + `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]`, which simplifies to 2 + `coef1[j]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
