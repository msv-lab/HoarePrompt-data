The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `nodes`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `nodes`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the second element in `nodes`, and `nodes` has at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must have at least three elements, and `j` will be the third element in `nodes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least three elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 2**
