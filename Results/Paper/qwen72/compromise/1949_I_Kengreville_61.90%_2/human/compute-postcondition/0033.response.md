Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains all the indices that have been visited, `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` might be `True` or `False` depending on the specific condition within the `dfs` function, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variables `c0` and `c1` will contain the sum of the values in `coef0` and `coef1` respectively for all indices `j` that are present in the `nodes` list. The `nodes` list will contain all the indices that have been visited, and `j` will be the last index in this list. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited[0]`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `ok` is still dependent on the condition within the `dfs` function.
