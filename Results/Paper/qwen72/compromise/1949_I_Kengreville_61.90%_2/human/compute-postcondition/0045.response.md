Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least one element, `j` is the first element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `coef1[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value at index `j` in the list `coef1`. Since `j` is the first element in `nodes`, and `coef1` has the value 1 at indices 0 and 1, `c1` will be incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
