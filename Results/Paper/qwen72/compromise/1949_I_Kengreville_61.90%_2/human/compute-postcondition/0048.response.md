Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0 + `coef0[j]`, and `c1` is `2 * coef1[j]`.** 

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Since `c1` was initially `coef1[j]`, after the increment, `c1` becomes `2 * coef1[j]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
