You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False, 0, and 1 respectively. nodes is an empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements. The list `nodes` remains empty.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 1. `nodes` is a list with `n` elements, each element being an index from 0 to `n-1`. `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `n`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 1. `nodes` is a list with `n` elements, each element being an index from 0 to `n-1`. `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `n`. If `ok` is `True`, the condition `ok` remains `True`. If `ok` is `False`, the condition `ok` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. It likely processes a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), and may return information related to these disks, such as their visitation status or calculated coefficients.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
