Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` remains unchanged and is still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements if `visited[0]` is `True`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, the element at index `2` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`. `nodes` is a list with `m` elements (1 <= m <= n), `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.**
