Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements if `visited[0]` is `True`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains the index `0`, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (which is 0), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is 1.***
