Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

First sample (left) and a valid way to change the radii of the disks (right).

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then `n` sets of coordinates and radii for disks, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to track the state of each disk. The function then iterates through each disk, and if a disk has not been visited, it sets `coef0` and `coef1` for that disk, collects indices of connected disks into `nodes`, and updates a cumulative sum of `coef0` and `coef1` values. If the cumulative sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, the function sets `ok` to `True`. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `ok` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise. After the function concludes, `n` remains the same, `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the input values, `visited` is a list of `n` `True` values, `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros, `coef1` is a list of `n` ones, `nodes` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1`, and `ok` is either `True` or `False` based on the cumulative sum of `coef1` values.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the disk at index `i`. If the disk at index `i` has not been visited, it marks it as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list. For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is exactly touching the disk at index `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`. The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and the `nodes` list, but does not change the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will have `True` for all disks that are part of the same connected component as the disk at index `i`, and the `nodes` list will contain the indices of these visited disks in the order they were visited. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated to reflect the coefficients for the disks in the connected component.
