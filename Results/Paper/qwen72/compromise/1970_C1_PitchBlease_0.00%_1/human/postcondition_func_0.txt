The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), a list of tuples `edges` (where each tuple (u, v) satisfies 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v), and an integer `start` (where 1 ≤ start ≤ n). It constructs an undirected tree from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
