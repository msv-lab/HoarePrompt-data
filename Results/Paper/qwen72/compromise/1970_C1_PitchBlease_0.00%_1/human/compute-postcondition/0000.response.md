Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= start, target <= n, and `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node index and each value is a list of neighboring node indices. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**
