The loop head in this case is `queue`. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. Given the state right before the loop, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` already contains one element, it is not empty, and the loop can proceed without any adjustments.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node index and each value is a list of neighboring node indices, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
