Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a sorted list that may contain elements, each of which is the result of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range [1, len(a) - 1] where `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) != 2`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. In all cases, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is updated to `y - i` and `ans` is updated to `ans + i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` must contain at least two elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is updated to `y - i + 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`. In both cases, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must contain at least three elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
