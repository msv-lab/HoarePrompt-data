Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must contain at least three elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
