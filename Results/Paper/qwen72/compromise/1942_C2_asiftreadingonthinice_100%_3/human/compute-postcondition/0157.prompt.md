Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. Otherwise, if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 != 0`, then `ans` remains `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` does not include the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element. If `y` >= `i - 1`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` < `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least two elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `y` is updated to `y` - (`i` - 1) and `ans` is updated to `ans` + `i`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 3, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least three elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `y` is updated to `y` - (`i` - 1) and `ans` is set to the value of the third element in `tmp`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
