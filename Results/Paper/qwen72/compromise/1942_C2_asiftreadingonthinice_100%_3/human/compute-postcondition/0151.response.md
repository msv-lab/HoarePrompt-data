Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least two elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `y` is updated to `y` - (`i` - 1) and `ans` is updated to `ans` + `i`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
