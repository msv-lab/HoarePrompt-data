You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bessie has a regular polygon cake with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - You can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we start with `x` vertices and can add up to `y` more.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means there is one additional vertex that can be used to form a triangle, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even, the gap can be divided into segments of 2, and the number of such segments is added to a list `tmp`.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The program also checks the gap between the last and first vertex in the sorted list.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the number of segments of 2 to the list `tmp`.

6. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted.
   - The program iterates through `tmp` and tries to use the available `y` vertices to form additional triangles.
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` (where `i` is the number of segments of 2), it adds `i` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, it breaks out of the loop.

7. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After the loop, any remaining `y` vertices are added to `ans`.
   - The final answer is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` (since the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in an `n`-sided polygon is `n - 2`).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial setup and the gaps between chosen vertices.
- It correctly optimizes the number of triangles by using the available `y` vertices.
- The final adjustment ensures that the answer does not exceed the maximum possible number of non-intersecting triangles.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
