### Reasoning

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown
1. **Grid and Pinball Movement:**
   - The grid is a string `s` of length `n` containing characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball placed on the `i`-th cell moves left if `s[i]` is `<` and right if `s[i]` is `>`.
   - After each move, the character at the current cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either the left or right border.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each cell `i` (from 1 to `n`), we need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid if it starts at cell `i`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

#### Solution Analysis
The solution provided uses two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to help calculate the number of steps for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the string `s1` of length `n`.
   - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing `>`.
   - It calculates the cumulative sum of these indices using `accumulate` and stores it in `preOne`.
   - It initializes `suffZero` to keep track of the cumulative sum of indices of cells containing `<` from the right.
   - It initializes an array `ans` to store the results for each cell.
   - It iterates over the cells from right to left:
     - If the current cell contains `>`, it updates the answer using the cumulative sums and the number of `>` and `<` cells.
     - If the current cell contains `<`, it updates the cumulative sum of `<` cells and the answer using the cumulative sums and the number of `>` and `<` cells.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

#### Verification
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

1. **Handling `>` Cells:**
   - When the pinball starts on a cell containing `>`, it moves right and inverts the cell to `<`.
   - The function uses the cumulative sums to calculate the time it takes to reach the right border or a cell containing `<`.

2. **Handling `<` Cells:**
   - When the pinball starts on a cell containing `<`, it moves left and inverts the cell to `>`.
   - The function uses the cumulative sums to calculate the time it takes to reach the left border or a cell containing `>`.

3. **Cumulative Sums:**
   - The cumulative sums `preOne` and `suffZero` are used to efficiently calculate the total number of steps without simulating each move individually.

4. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid from either the left or right border.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1: `s = "><<"`**
  - For `i = 1` (cell 1 contains `>`):
    - Moves right to cell 2, inverts `>` to `<`.
    - Moves right to cell 3, inverts `<` to `>`.
    - Moves right to cell 4, leaves the grid.
    - Total time: 3 seconds.
  - For `i = 2` (cell 2 contains `<`):
    - Moves left to cell 1, inverts `<` to `>`.
    - Moves right to cell 2, inverts `>` to `<`.
    - Moves left to cell 1, inverts `<` to `>`.
