Output State: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial state for each test case, with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), remains unchanged.**
