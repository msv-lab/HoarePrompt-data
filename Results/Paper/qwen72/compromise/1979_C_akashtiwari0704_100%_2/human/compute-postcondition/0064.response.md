Output State: **`sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[i])` to its current value, which was `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`. Therefore, `sumo` is now `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
