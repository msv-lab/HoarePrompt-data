The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.**
