Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `sumo` will contain the sum of the values of `prod // a[j]` for all indices `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
- The variable `bets` remains the same input integer greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will be `bets - 1` after the loop completes.
- Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` will be updated to `prod // a[j]`.
- The variable `sumo` will still be less than `prod`.
- The variable `ans` will be a string containing the updated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`, each followed by a space.
- The variable `T` will be incremented by the number of iterations, which is `bets`.
- The variable `t` must still be greater than `T`.
- The list `a` and the variable `prod` remain unchanged from their initial values.
