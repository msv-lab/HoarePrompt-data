The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `bets` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]` + `a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`**
