Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.**
