Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `bets - 1`
   - `bets` is the same as the initial `bets`
   - `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `bets - 1`, but this value is not used in the code snippet provided.
   - The variable `bets` is mentioned but not used in the code snippet provided.
   - The variable `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space.

4. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - The initial state mentions that `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space.
   - This means that `ans` will be a string that concatenates all elements of the list `a` with a space in between each element.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`.

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`.

Output: **" ".join(map(str, a)) (where a is the list of elements, and each element is converted to its string representation followed by a space)**
