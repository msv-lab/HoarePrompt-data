Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**

The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
