Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `T` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user for the last test case, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a` for the last test case, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output for that test case is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the integers in the list `a` after updating each `a[j]` to `prod // a[j]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the loop reads an integer `bets` and a list of integers `a`.
- The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of the integers in `a`.
- The variable `prod` is set to the LCM of the integers in `a`.
- Each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]`.
- The variable `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that test case is `-1`.
- Otherwise, the output for that test case is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the updated elements in `a`.
- After all iterations, `T` is equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
