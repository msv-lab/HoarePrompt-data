Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `bets - 1`, and the string `ans` will contain the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`, each followed by a space. The array `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`. The variable `sumo` will have been increased by the sum of these updated values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, and it will still be less than `prod`. The initial conditions for `bets` and `prod` remain unchanged.
