The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, the input is expected to be provided in the form of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the outcomes. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
