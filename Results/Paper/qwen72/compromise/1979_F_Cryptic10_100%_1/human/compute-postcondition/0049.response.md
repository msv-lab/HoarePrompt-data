Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0.**
