To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it.
- `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ops` is empty**:
   - Since `ops` is empty, it contains no elements.

2. **`p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it**:
   - `p1` will contain the elements of `vx` because `ops` is empty and thus no elements from `ops` are appended to `p1`.

3. **`p2` contains elements from `ops` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`**:
   - Since `ops` is empty, no elements are appended to `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

4. **`p1[::-1]`**:
   - This is a reversed version of `p1`. If `p1` contains elements from `vx`, then `p1[::-1]` will be those elements in reverse order.

5. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**:
   - Since `p2` is empty, this will simply be the reversed list `p1`.

6. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**:
   - This converts each element in the reversed `p1` list to a string and joins them with a space.
   - For example, if `p1` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `p1[::-1]` is `[3, 2, 1]`, and `' '.join(map(str, [3, 2, 1]))` will be `"3 2 1"`.

7. **`'! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**:
   - This formats the string to include the reversed and joined elements of `p1`.
   - For example, if `p1` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `! 3 2 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `!` followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order, separated by spaces. Since `p2` is empty, it does not contribute to the output.

Output: **! [elements of p1 in reverse order] (where p1 contains the remaining elements of vx and any elements from ops that were appended to it, and ops is empty)**
