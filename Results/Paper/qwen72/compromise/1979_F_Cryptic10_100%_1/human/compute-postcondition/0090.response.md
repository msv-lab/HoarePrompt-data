Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the first and second values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, respectively. `ops` is either empty or contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`. `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it. `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. `vx` must contain at least 3 elements.**
