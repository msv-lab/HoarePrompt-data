To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` from the `ops` list. The loop will execute if `ops` is not empty. The state of `p1`, `p2`, and `vx` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given the loop head:
```
for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:
```
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
- `v1` and `v2` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left**
