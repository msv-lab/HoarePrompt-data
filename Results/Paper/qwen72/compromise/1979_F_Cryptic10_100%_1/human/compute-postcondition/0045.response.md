The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` adds a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are not changed, but `ops` now contains this tuple. The other variables (`vx`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 1`, and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**
