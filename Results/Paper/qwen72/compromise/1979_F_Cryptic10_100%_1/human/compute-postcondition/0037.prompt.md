Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive). `ops` is a list containing tuples, where each tuple represents the elements removed from `vx` during the iterations. If `v2` > 0, the tuple `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`. The exact elements in `vx` and the contents of `ops` depend on the values returned by the function `q` during each iteration. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` will be assigned from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and `p1` has been updated to include `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` has been updated to include `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the first tuple in the original `ops` list, and `v1` is appended to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
