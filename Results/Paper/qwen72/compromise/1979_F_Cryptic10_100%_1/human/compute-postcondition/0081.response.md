Output State: **`ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus `v1`, `v1` is the first value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is the second value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`**

Explanation:
- The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the integer `v1` from the set `vx`.
- The initial state specifies that `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and the input integer must be greater than 2.
- After removing `v1` from `vx`, the set `vx` now contains all integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`.
- The values of `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged, except for the updated state of `vx` after the removal of `v1`.
