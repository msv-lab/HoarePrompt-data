Output State: **The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), but `v1`, `v3`, and the new `v1` have been removed from `vx`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. `ops` is a list. If the new `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If the new `v2` â‰¤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `v3` is also removed from `vx`. In this case, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `v1` and `v2` are the new values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, and `v1` is no longer in `vx`. `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `v3` is no longer in `vx`.**
