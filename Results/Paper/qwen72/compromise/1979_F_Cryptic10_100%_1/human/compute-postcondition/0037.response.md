Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples it originally had, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`vx`**: The set `vx` remains unchanged and still contains exactly 2 integers.
- **`ops`**: The list `ops` remains unchanged and contains all the tuples it originally had.
- **`p1`**: The list `p1` starts with the two integers from `vx`. For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops` (processed in reverse order), if the last element in `p1` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- **`p2`**: The list `p2` starts empty. For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops` (processed in reverse order), if the last element in `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `p1` and `p2` will contain elements from `ops` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2` for each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops` (processed in reverse order).
