The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `num` is at least 1. The loop iterates from the last index of `num` down to 0, so for the loop to start, `i` must be set to `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
