### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and processes them.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Handling:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates through each item in the `array`, adding the length of the item (number of digits) to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the count to the `zeros` list if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing every other element to `subtract_zero`.
   - The idea is to simulate the optimal play where Anna reverses numbers with trailing zeros, and Sasha concatenates numbers to maximize the total number of digits.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If it is, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The program sets the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a typographical error and should be corrected.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Corrected from 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Evaluation:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The original assessment correctly identified the typographical error where "Sashah" should be "Sasha".
  - This error would cause the program to produce incorrect output for test cases where Sasha wins.

- **Logic and Strategy:**
  - The logic for counting total digits and trailing zeros is correct.
  - The strategy of sorting the `zeros` list and summing every other element to simulate optimal play is also correct.
  - The winning condition check is logically sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Final Decision:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the typographical error.
- The program is incorrect due to the typographical error.

Final: **False**
