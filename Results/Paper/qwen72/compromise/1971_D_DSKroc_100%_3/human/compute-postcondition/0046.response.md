Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 1, `s` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the first character of `s` is less than the integer value of the second character of `s`. If the integer value of the third character of `s` is not equal to the integer value of the fourth character of `s`, then `count` is either 2 or 3. If the integer value of the third character of `s` is equal to the integer value of the fourth character of `s`, then `count` remains 2.***
