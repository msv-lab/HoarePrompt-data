Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 1, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, and `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the first character of `s` is less than the integer value of the second character of `s`. If the integer value of the first character of `s` is not equal to the integer value of the second character of `s`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
