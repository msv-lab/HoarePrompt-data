Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the integer values of the characters are not equal, and `i` is `len(s) - 2`. If `flag` is 0, it indicates there are no pairs of adjacent characters in `s` where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character. If `flag` is 1, it indicates there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character.**
