Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 2, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count` is 0, and `flag` is either 0 or 1.** 

The initial state of `t`, `q`, `s`, `i`, and `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `count` is explicitly set to 0.
