Postcondition: **The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The function should take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases. `r` is a list of integers read from the input. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`.**
