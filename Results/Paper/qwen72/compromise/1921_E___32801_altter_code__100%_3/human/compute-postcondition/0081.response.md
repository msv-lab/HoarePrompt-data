Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first element of the list `r` (i.e., `r[0]`).
- `m` is the second element of the list `r` (i.e., `r[1]`).
- `x1` is defined as `r[2] + a`.
- `x2` is defined as `r[4] - a`.
- `x2` is still greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` remains even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is defined as `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1` is not within the range 1 to `m` inclusive, or `x1` is not within the range 1 to `n` inclusive.

### Analysis:
1. **List `r` and its elements**:
   - `r[0]` is `n`.
   - `r[1]` is `m`.
   - `r[2]` is some integer.
   - `r[4]` is some integer.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer (not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a known value or variable).

2. **Variables `x1` and `x2`**:
   - `x1 = r[2] + a`
   - `x2 = r[4] - a`
   - `x2 > x1` and `x2 - x1` is even.

3. **Variables `b` and `t`**:
   - `b = x2 - x1`
   - `t = abs(y2 - y1)`

4. **Conditions**:
   - `y1 != y2`
   - `x1 >= 1`
   - `x2 <= n`
   - One of the following conditions must be true:
     - `b // 2 <= a`
     - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
     - `y1` is not within the range 1 to `m` inclusive
     - `x1` is not within the range 1 to `n` inclusive

### What is printed:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions provided in the initial state are complex, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is simply printing a fixed string `'draw'`.
- The conditions are likely used to determine whether the program should reach this point, but they do not change the content of the `print` statement.

Output: **draw**
