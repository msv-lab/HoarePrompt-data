Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, and `x2` is still greater than `x1`, with the difference between `x2` and `x1` remaining even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`. `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1` is not within the range 1 to `m` inclusive, or `x1` is not within the range 1 to `n` inclusive.**
