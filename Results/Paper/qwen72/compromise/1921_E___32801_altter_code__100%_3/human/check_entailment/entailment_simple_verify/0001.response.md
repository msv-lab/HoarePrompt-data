### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `tt`, and iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the input for each test case, which includes the dimensions of the board `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function is not correctly defined in terms of parameters. It should take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, but it reads these from the input directly. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the input format is consistent.
   - The function checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's row (`x2 <= x1`). If so, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row. This is correct.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position.
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is directly below Bob's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Alice wins. This is correct.
   - If not, it simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position. The logic here is complex and involves updating `y1` and `x1` based on the relative positions of `y1` and `y2`.
   - The program then checks if the new positions of the chips are within the board boundaries and if Alice can force a win. If not, it checks if Bob can force a draw by moving to a position where Alice cannot win. This is also correct.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`), Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position.
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is directly above Alice's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Bob wins. This is correct.
   - If not, it simulates Bob's and Alice's moves to see if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position. Similar to the odd difference case, the logic involves updating `y1` and `x1` based on the relative positions of `y1` and `y2`.
   - The program then checks if the new positions of the chips are within the board boundaries and if Bob can force a win. If not, it checks if Alice can force a draw by moving to a position where Bob cannot win. This is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).
   - It ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries by checking `1 <= x1 <= n` and `1 <= y1 <= m`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game for each test case. The output is consistent with the problem description and the logic implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
The program's logic and handling of the game rules are correct. The function `func_1()` reads the input directly within the function, which is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the input format is consistent. The program correctly simulates the moves and checks the winning conditions for both Alice and Bob.

Final: **True**
