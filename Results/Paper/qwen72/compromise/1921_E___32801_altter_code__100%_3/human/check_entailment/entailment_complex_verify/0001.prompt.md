You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from the input, representing the dimensions of a board (`n`, `m`) and the initial positions of two chips (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`). It then determines the outcome of a game based on the positions of the chips and prints one of three possible results: 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and one of the outcomes has been printed, but no variables are modified outside the function's scope.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `tt`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the dimensions of the board `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - It checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's row (`x2 <= x1`). If so, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row.
   - If Bob's chip is above Alice's row (`x2 > x1`), it checks if the difference in rows is odd or even.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position.
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is directly below Bob's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Alice wins.
   - If not, it simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
   - If Alice cannot force a win, it checks if Bob can force a draw by moving to a position where Alice cannot win.
   - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`), Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position.
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is directly above Alice's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Bob wins.
   - If not, it simulates Bob's and Alice's moves to see if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position.
   - If Bob cannot force a win, it checks if Alice can force a draw by moving to a position where Bob cannot win.
   - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).
   - It also ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the given conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic of the game and the rules provided in the problem description. The simulation of moves and the checks for winning conditions are implemented appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****

However, it's always a good idea to test the program with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected in all scenarios. If you have any specific test cases or concerns, feel free to share them for further verification.
