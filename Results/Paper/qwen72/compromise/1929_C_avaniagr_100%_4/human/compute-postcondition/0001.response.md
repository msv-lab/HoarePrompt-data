Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases from the input, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The loop itself has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.**
