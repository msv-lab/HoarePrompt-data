Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` contains the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same) or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different), and the uppercase version of the second character of `a` is appended to `template`.***
