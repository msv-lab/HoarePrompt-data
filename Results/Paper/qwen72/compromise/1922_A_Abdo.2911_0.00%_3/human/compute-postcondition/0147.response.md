Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. `match_a_b` is set to `False` if any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches when converted to lowercase. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `False`. The character at position `i` in `template` is not lowercase, and the character at position `i` in `c` is the same as the character at position `i` in `template` when both are converted to lowercase.**
