Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.**
