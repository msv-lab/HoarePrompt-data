Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`, `match_a_b` is `False`, the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase, and the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` (or both) is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
