Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter. The current value of `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If any character in `template` is a lowercase letter and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match it, or if any character in `template` is not a lowercase letter and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches it in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `True`.**
