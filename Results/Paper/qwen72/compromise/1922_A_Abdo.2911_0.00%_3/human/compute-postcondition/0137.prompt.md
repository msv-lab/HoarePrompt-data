Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. `match_a_b` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and the character at position `i` in `a` or `b` does not match `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
