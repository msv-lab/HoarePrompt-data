Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `template`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, and `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace. These conditions are still valid after the code has been executed.
