The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.**
