Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. `match_c` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `template` remain unchanged. The variable `match_c` is still `False`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
