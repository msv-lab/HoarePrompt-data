Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, and `match_a_b` is `True`.** 

The variable `match_a_b` has been set to `True`, and all other variables (`n`, `i`, and `template`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
