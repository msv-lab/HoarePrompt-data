The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `template` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
