The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, `template` is a list. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` contains the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same) or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different), and the uppercase version of the second character of `a` is appended to `template`.**
