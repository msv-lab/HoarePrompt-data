Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`.
   - `match_a_b` is `True`.
   - `match_c` is `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
