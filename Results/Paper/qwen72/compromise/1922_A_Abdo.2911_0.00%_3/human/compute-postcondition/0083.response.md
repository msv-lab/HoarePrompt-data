Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`.
- `match_c` is `False` if any character in `template` is a lowercase letter and does not match the corresponding character in `c`, or if any character in `template` is not a lowercase letter and matches the corresponding character in `c` in a case-insensitive manner. Otherwise, `match_c` is `True`.
- `match_a_b` is `True`.
- `match_c` is `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and objects, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The value of `match_c` is `False`, but this does not influence the `print` statement since the `print` statement is not conditional.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
