Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The template is constructed by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it must match the corresponding character in `a` and `b`.
     - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The function then checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the construction of the template.
   - The matching conditions for `a` and `b` are correctly implemented.
   - The condition for `c` not matching the template is also correctly implemented.
   - The function processes multiple test cases and prints the correct output for each.

4. **Example Validation**:
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, `a="a"`, `b="b"`, `c="c"`):
     - The template is "A" (since `a[0]` != `b[0]`).
     - `a` and `b` match the template (both do not have 'a' at position 0).
     - `c` does not match the template (it has 'c' at position 0).
     - Output: "YES".
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, `a="aa"`, `b="bb"`, `c="aa"`):
     - The template is "AA" (since `a[0]` != `b[0]` and `a[1]` != `b[1]`).
     - `a` and `b` match the template (neither has 'a' at position 0 or 1).
     - `c` matches the template (it has 'a' at both positions 0 and 1).
     - Output: "NO".
   - For the third test case (`n=10`, `a="mathforces"`, `b="luckforces"`, `c="adhoccoder"`):
     - The template is "MATHFORCES" (since `a[0]` != `b[0]`, `a[1]` != `b[1]`, etc.).
     - `a` and `b` match the template (neither has 'm', 'a', 't', 'h', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'c', 'e', 's' at the respective positions).
     - `c` does not match the template (it has 'a' at position 0, which is not allowed).
     - Output: "YES".
   - For the fourth test case (`n=3`, `a="acc"`, `b="abd"`, `c="abc"`):
     - The template is "ACC" (since `a[0]` != `b[0]`, `a[1]` != `b[1]`, and `a[2]` == `b[2]`).
     - `a` and `b` match the template (neither has 'a', 'c', or 'c' at the respective positions).
     - `c` matches the template (it has 'a' at position 0, which is allowed).
     - Output: "NO".

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The function's logic aligns with the problem description and correctly processes the input and output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
