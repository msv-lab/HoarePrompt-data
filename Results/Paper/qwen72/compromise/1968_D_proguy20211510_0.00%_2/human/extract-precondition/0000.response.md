Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. For the problem described, the function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), `p` is a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and `a` is an array of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
