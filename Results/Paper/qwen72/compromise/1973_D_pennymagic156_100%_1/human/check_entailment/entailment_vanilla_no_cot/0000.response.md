Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues:

1. **Query Strategy**: The program starts by querying the maximum possible value of `f(l, r)` for the entire array (`i * n`), which is not necessary and may not help in finding the correct subarray splits. The strategy should focus on finding the correct `m` value that can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` value.

2. **Subarray Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the array into `k` subarrays is flawed. The program attempts to find a value `i * v` and then tries to split the array using this value, but it does not ensure that the subarrays are valid according to the problem's constraints. Specifically, it does not check if the subarrays have the same `f(l, r)` value.

3. **Handling of Queries**: The program does not handle the queries efficiently. It makes unnecessary queries and does not use the results effectively to determine the correct `m` value.

4. **Termination Condition**: The program does not correctly handle the termination condition for the loop where it tries to find the correct `m` value. It may incorrectly conclude that no valid `m` exists even when one does.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Use a more efficient strategy to find the maximum possible `m` value.
- Ensure that the subarrays are split correctly and that each subarray has the same `f(l, r)` value.
- Handle the queries and responses more effectively to ensure the correct solution is found within the allowed number of queries.

Here is a revised approach that might work better:

1. **Binary Search for Maximum `m`**: Use binary search to find the maximum possible `m` value.
2. **Verify Subarray Splits**: For each candidate `m`, verify if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` value.
3. **Efficient Querying**: Use the results of the queries to adjust the search range and find the correct `m`.

This approach would be more structured and likely to produce the correct result.
