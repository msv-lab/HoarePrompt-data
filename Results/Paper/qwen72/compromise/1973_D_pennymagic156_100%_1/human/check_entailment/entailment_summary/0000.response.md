### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same value of `f(l, r)`.
   - The function `f(l, r)` is defined as `(r - l + 1) * max(a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r])`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1, func_2, func_3, func_4:** These functions are utility functions for reading input. They are used to parse different types of input data.
   - **func_5:** This is the main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

3. **func_5 Logic:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_3`.
     - Initializes `v` to 1.
   - **Finding the Maximum Value:**
     - Iterates from `n` down to 1, querying the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
     - If the response `v` is `n`, sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Subarrays:**
     - Iterates through possible values of `i` from 1 to `n // k + 1`.
     - For each `i`, initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to 1.
     - Queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - If all `k` subarrays are found and `l` reaches `n + 1`, prints the result `i * v` and returns.
   - **No Valid Split:**
     - If no valid split is found, prints `-1` and returns.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and initializes variables.
   - The logic for finding the maximum value `v` and checking for valid subarrays is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The function handles the edge cases and ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the limit.
   - The function correctly prints the result and handles the interaction with the judge.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
