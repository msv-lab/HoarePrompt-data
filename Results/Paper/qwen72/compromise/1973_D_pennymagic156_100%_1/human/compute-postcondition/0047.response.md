Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, so `cnt` is now `k - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
