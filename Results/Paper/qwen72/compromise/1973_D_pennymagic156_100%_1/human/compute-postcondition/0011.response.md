Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `i` is `n - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `v = func_2()` updates the value of `v` to the return value of the function `func_2()`. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `v` and retains the initial conditions for `n` and `i`.
