The function `func_2()` is called, but since no specific implementation or side effects of `func_2()` are provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables or state directly from this call. However, based on the initial conditions, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, calling `func_2()` does not change the fact that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.**
