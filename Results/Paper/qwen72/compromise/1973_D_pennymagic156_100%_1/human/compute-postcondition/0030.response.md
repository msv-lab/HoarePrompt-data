Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the initial state already specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`, the value of `l` remains the same after the code is executed. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.
