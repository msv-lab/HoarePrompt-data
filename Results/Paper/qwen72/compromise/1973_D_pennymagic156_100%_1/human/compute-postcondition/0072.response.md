To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is non-zero.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 2.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. This means `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2()` being less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Ensure `k` is greater than 2.
- **`l`**: Ensure `func_2()` is less than `n`.

### Final State:
Given the conditions, the state should be adjusted to ensure that both `cnt` and `l` meet the criteria for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer and greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
