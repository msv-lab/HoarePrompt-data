Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`), and `v` is the last value of `i * v` printed before the loop exits.**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_2()` does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, `l`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only information provided about `l` is that it is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`. The value of `v` is described as the last value of `i * v` printed before the loop exits, which remains the same as in the initial state.
