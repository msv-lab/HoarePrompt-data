To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The variable `cnt` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 2 (since `k - 2 > 0`).

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The variable `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`cnt`**: Ensure that `k` is greater than 2 so that `cnt` remains non-zero.
- **`l`**: Ensure that `func_2()` is less than `n` so that `l` remains less than `n + 1`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted as follows:

- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2 (unchanged).
- `k` must be a positive integer greater than 2 (adjusted from greater than 1).
- `cnt` is `k - 2` (unchanged).
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (unchanged).
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n` (unchanged).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`**
