Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `v` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `n`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the `break` statement. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of the fact that the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
