Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3.
- `k` must be a positive integer.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
- `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`l`**: According to the initial state, `l` is 1.
2. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 3.
3. **`v`**: The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can represent it symbolically as `v`.

### Constructing the Output:
- The print statement will format the string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.
- `l` is 1.
- `i * v` is `3 * v`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 3 * v** (where `v` is the value of the variable `v`)

This is the most precise description based on the given initial state.
