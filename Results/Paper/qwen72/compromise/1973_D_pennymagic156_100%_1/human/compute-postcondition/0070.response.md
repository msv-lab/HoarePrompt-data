Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The new value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, which is consistent with the initial state where `l` was already defined as `func_2() + 1`.
- The condition that `l` is not equal to `n + 1` remains valid.
- The condition that `func_2()` must be less than `n` remains valid.
- The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` remains valid.
