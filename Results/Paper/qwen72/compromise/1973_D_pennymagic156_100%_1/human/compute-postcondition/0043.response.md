Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`.
- `l` is updated to 1.
- The conditions that `n // k` is at least 2 and `k` is a positive integer remain unchanged.
- The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` is still valid because `cnt` is now `k` (which is a positive integer) and `l` is 1, which is not equal to `n + 1`.
