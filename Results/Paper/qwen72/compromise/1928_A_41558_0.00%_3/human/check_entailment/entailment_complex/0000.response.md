Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Case**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is because any cut parallel to one of the sides will result in at least one rectangle with a non-integer side. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **One Dimension is Half of the Other**: If one dimension is exactly half of the other, then cutting the rectangle will result in two identical smaller rectangles. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these two rectangles can only form a 2x4 or 4x2 rectangle, which are considered the same. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Other Cases**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then Bob can always form a different rectangle. For example:
   - A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be combined to form a 4x3 rectangle.
   - A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can then be combined to form a 1x6 rectangle.
   - A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can then be combined to form a 1x4 rectangle.
   - A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can then be combined to form a 1x8 rectangle.

The function correctly handles all these cases by printing 'YES' when neither condition is met.

However, there is a minor issue with the code: the function uses `a / 2 == b` and `b / 2 == a` to check if one dimension is exactly half of the other. This can lead to floating-point precision issues. It is better to use integer division and comparison to avoid such issues.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Final Correctness:
Despite the minor issue with floating-point division, the original program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. However, for best practices, the integer division should be used.

Correctness: **True**
