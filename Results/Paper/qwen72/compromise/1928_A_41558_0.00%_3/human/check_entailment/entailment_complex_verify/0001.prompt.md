You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` for each test case are processed, and the loop prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly half of the other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one dimension is exactly half of the other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and the test case inputs `a` and `b` are not retained after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` which represent the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both are odd, it prints "NO" because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, it proceeds to the next condition.
   - The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". This is because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles that can only form the original rectangle when recombined, and no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES".

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - **Odd Dimensions**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is correct.
   - **Even Dimensions**: If either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The program further checks if the cut results in two rectangles that can only form the original rectangle when recombined. This is a valid check because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when recombined.
   - **Other Cases**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES". This is correct because in all other cases, Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting and recombining the pieces.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs "NO" and "YES" in uppercase, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that the output can be in any case.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly handles the problem's requirements and logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
