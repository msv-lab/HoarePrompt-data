Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program has a logical flaw in its conditions for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. This condition checks if one side is exactly half of the other, but this is not a valid criterion for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions (a or b) is even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, any cut will result in two rectangles with odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks if either dimension is even and prints "YES" if so, otherwise it prints "NO". This logic correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description.
