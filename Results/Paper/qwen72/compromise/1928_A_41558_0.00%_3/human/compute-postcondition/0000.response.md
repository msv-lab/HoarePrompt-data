The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The number of test cases, `t`, is still a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle.**
