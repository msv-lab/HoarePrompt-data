The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times an integer appears in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in `arr` by 4.**
