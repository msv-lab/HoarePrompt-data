### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program is designed to simulate a simplified version of a Quidditch match, where players from two teams (Red and Blue) compete to score goals by moving and throwing the Quaffle. A Bludger can eliminate players if they are in the same cell.
   - The field is represented as a grid, and the actions are performed step by step.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`**
   - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
   - The function correctly modifies the position of the entity by adjusting the row and column indices.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(t)`**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players whose positions match the Bludger's position.
   - It then updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
   - The function sorts the list of eliminated players and prints the elimination events in the required format.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

4. **Overall Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the initial field configuration and processes the actions step by step.
   - It handles player movements, ball catching, and throwing.
   - It checks for goal scoring and player eliminations.
   - It prints the events and the final score.

5. **Detailed Analysis of the Main Logic:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program correctly initializes the field, goals, Bludger, players, and the ball.
   - **Processing Actions:**
     - The program correctly handles the movement of the Quaffle and the Bludger using `func_1`.
     - The program correctly handles the movement of players and updates their positions.
     - The program correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle by players.
     - The program correctly handles the throwing of the Quaffle by players.
     - The program correctly checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the scores accordingly.
     - The program correctly handles player eliminations by the Bludger and prints the elimination events.
   - **Final Score:**
     - The program correctly prints the final score after processing all actions.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the basic movements and eliminations correctly.
   - It correctly handles the Quaffle's movement and goal scoring.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle returns to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program correctly prints the events in the required format and order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented and integrated into the main logic of the program. The program correctly simulates the game, processes the actions, and prints the events and final score as specified.

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
