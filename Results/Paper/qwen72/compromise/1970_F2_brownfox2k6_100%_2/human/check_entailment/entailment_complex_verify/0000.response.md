### Reasoning:

1. **Movement and Elimination Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of entities (players, Quaffle, and Bludger) using the `func_1` function. The function updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction provided.
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same cell as the Bludger. It also prints the elimination message and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.

2. **Scoring and Ball Reset:**
   - The program correctly handles the scoring of goals. When a player throws the Quaffle (`d == 'T'`), it checks if the ball is in a goal of the opposing team and updates the score accordingly.
   - The program also correctly handles the reset of the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored. The coordinates are set to `[n // 2, m // 2]`.

3. **Catching the Quaffle:**
   - The program correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle (`d == 'C'`), the `carry` variable is updated to the player who caught it.

4. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game using the `print('FINAL SCORE:', rs, bs)` statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where a player scores in their own goal by correctly awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The program also handles the edge case where a player is eliminated by a Bludger, and it correctly updates the player's position and prints the elimination message.

### Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment:** The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to handle scoring, ball reset, and final score output. However, upon closer inspection, the program does indeed handle these aspects correctly.
- **Annotations:** The annotations confirm that the program correctly updates the positions of entities, handles scoring, and prints the final score.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles the necessary logic correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
