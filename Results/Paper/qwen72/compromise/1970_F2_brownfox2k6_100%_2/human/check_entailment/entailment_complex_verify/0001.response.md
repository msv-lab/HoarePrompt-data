### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program simulates a Quidditch match where players from two teams (Red and Blue) compete to score goals by moving and throwing the Quaffle. A Bludger can eliminate players if they are in the same cell.
   - The field is represented as a grid, and the actions are performed step by step.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`**
   - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
   - The function correctly modifies the position of the entity by adjusting the row and column indices.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(t)`**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players whose positions match the Bludger's position.
   - It then updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
   - The function sorts the list of eliminated players and prints the elimination events in the required format.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the initial field configuration and processes the actions step by step.
   - It correctly handles player movements, ball catching, and throwing.
   - It checks for goal scoring and player eliminations.
   - It prints the events and the final score.

5. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Reading the Initial Field Configuration:**
     - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field and initializes the positions of the goals, players, Quaffle, and Bludger.
   - **Processing Actions:**
     - The program correctly processes each action:
       - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):**
         - The `func_1` function is called to update the position of the entity.
       - **Catching the Quaffle (`C`):**
         - The program updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
       - **Throwing the Quaffle (`T`):**
         - The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, it updates the score and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
   - **Player Elimination:**
     - The `func_2` function is called after each action to check for player elimination. It correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same cell as the Bludger.
   - **Goal Scoring:**
     - The program correctly checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - **Final Score:**
     - The program prints the final score after processing all actions.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the basic movements and eliminations correctly.
   - It correctly handles the Quaffle's movement and goal scoring.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and updates their positions to `[-1, -1]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly processes the actions, handles movements, eliminations, and goal scoring, and prints the events and final score in the required format.

Final: **True**
