Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `l` is an input string. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`, and the first two elements of `lst` are removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is set to the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
