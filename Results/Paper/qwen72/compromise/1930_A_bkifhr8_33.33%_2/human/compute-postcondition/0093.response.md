The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `ans_f`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `ans_f`. If `ans_f` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0, and `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations. Since `t` is 0, `ans_f` is likely to be an empty list, which means the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `ans_f` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `ans_f` is not empty.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least one element**
