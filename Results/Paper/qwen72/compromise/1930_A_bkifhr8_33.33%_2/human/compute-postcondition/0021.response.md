Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
