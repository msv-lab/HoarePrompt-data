To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the list `a` (since `n` is a constant and does not change).

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop is iterating over `range(n * 2)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is a list of 2n integers. The state of `a` does not change between iterations of the loop, as it is not modified in the loop head. Therefore, `a` remains a list of 2n integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.

3. **Variable `n`**: `n` is an input integer and remains constant throughout the loop. It is between 1 and 50 inclusive.

4. **Variable `t`**: `t` is greater than 2n + 1. Since `t` is not modified in the loop head, it remains greater than 2n + 1.

5. **Variables `ans_f` and `ans`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and are not modified in the loop head. Therefore, their states remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration. `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, and `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst` added to the original value of `ans` if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is an empty list. If the length of `lst` is 2, the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst` added to the original value of `ans` if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is an empty list. If the length of `lst` is 2, the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
