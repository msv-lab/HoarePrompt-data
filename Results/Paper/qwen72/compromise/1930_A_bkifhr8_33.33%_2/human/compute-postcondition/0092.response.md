Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed its execution. The variable `i` will also be 0 because the loop counter `i` is reset after the loop finishes. The variable `n` will still be an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, as it is read from the input for each iteration. The list `a` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The list `ans_f` will contain the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations. For each iteration, `lst` will either be an empty list (if the number of elements in `a` was even) or a list with 2 elements (if the number of elements in `a` was odd).
