The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n * 2` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n * 2` will always be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which guarantees that `n * 2` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` using a space as the delimiter.**
