Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, ans_f is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n - 1` (or `2n` depending on the final iteration), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the initial `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2` at the end of the loop, `lst` will be empty. If `len(lst) == 2` at the end of the loop, `lst` will contain the last two elements from the initial `lst` that were not removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n`, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is unchanged, the length of `lst` is 2 or 0, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2n, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block and the new value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
