Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n - 1` (or `2n` depending on the final iteration), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the initial `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2` at the end of the loop, `lst` will be empty. If `len(lst) == 2` at the end of the loop, `lst` will contain the last two elements from the initial `lst` that were not removed.**
