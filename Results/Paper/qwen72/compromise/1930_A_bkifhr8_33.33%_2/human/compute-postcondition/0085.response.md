The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst` because `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`, and `lst[0]` is the first element of the list. The length of `lst` was initially 2, so after removing the first element, `lst` will have a length of 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, `lst` has a length of 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
