The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000), an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and a list `a` of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
