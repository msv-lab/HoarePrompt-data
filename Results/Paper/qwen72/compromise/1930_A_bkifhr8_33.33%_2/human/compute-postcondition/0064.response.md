Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2n + 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is 0, the length of `lst` is 2 or 0, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.**

The value of `n` is updated to the input integer provided by the user, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
