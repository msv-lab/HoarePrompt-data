Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **List Splitting and Conversion**: The program splits the input string `l` into a list `lst` and converts the elements to integers. This step is necessary to work with the numbers.

3. **Loop for Each Test Case**: The program iterates `t` times, processing each test case as described.

4. **Pair Selection and Summing**: The program attempts to select pairs of integers from the list and add the minimum of each pair to the score `ans`. However, the way it selects and removes elements from the list is incorrect. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
   lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
   ```
   are problematic. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which means the program is not correctly removing the first two elements of the list. Instead, it should remove the first two elements directly.

5. **Correct Pair Removal**: The correct way to remove the first two elements from the list and add their minimum to the score is:
   ```python
   ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
   lst.pop(0)
   lst.pop(0)
   ```
   This ensures that the first two elements are removed after their minimum is added to the score.

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the list has exactly two elements left, but it should also handle the case where the list has fewer than two elements, which should not happen if the input is valid.

7. **Output**: The program correctly appends the score for each test case to the list `ans_f` and prints the results after processing all test cases.

Given the issues with the pair selection and removal, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
