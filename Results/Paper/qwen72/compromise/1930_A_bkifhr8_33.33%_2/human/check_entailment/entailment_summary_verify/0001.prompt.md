You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers from the user. It then processes these integers by repeatedly selecting the minimum of the first two elements, summing these minimum values, and removing the selected elements until the list is either empty or contains only two elements. The function appends the sum of these minimum values to a list `ans_f` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `ans_f` contains `t` elements, and the list `lst` is either empty or contains 2 elements for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Processing the List:**
   - The program attempts to iterate over the list and select pairs of integers to add their minimum value to the score.
   - However, the way it removes elements from the list is incorrect. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are not removing the correct elements. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, which will lead to incorrect removals and potential index errors.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always select the smallest two numbers from the list and add the smaller of the two to the score.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the list and then iterating over the sorted list, adding the first `n` elements to the score (since the first `n` elements will be the smallest `n` pairs).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The program should sort the list of integers and then sum the first `n` elements to get the maximum score.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - `t = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n = int(input())` reads the number of pairs.
  - `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads the list of integers and converts them to a list of integers.

- **Sorting and Summing:**
  - `lst.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order.
  - `ans = sum(lst[:n])` sums the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest `n` pairs.

- **Output:**
  - `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the score for the current test case to the results list.
  - After processing all test cases, the program prints each score in the results list.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed method of removing elements from the list. The corrected program follows the optimal strategy and is correct.
