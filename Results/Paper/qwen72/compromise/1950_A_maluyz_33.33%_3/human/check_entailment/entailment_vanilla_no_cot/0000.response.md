Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met. This correctly identifies a stair.

3. **Equal Digits Condition**: The program checks if `a == b == c` and prints "NONE" if this condition is met. This correctly identifies the case where all digits are the same, which is neither a stair nor a peak.

4. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met. This correctly identifies a peak because `b` being the maximum means `a < b` and `b > c`.

5. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This correctly handles all other cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
