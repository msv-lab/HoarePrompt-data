### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It then checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If true, it prints "NONE".
   - Next, it checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using `max(a, b, c) == b`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
   - The condition `a == b == c` correctly identifies when all digits are the same, which should be "NONE".
   - The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is intended to identify a peak. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that `a < b > c`. For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `c = 3`, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true, but `a < b > c` is not satisfied because `a == b`. This is a logical error.
   - The else condition correctly handles all other cases, which should be "NONE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where `b` is not the maximum but the digits do not form a stair (e.g., `4 1 7`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions, except for the logical error in the peak condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair or neither. However, the peak condition is not correctly implemented because it does not account for the case where `a` and `b` are equal. This can lead to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Correctness:
