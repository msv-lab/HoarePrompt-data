Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits form a peak but the peak is not centered at `b`. For example, if the input is `3 4 1`, the program will incorrectly output "PEAK" because it checks if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, according to the problem description, a peak should satisfy the condition `a < b > c`, and `3 4 1` does not satisfy this condition because `3 < 4 > 1` is not true. The correct output for `3 4 1` should be "NONE".
