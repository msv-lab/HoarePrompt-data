To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `c` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1` after the loop executes all iterations.
- `n` remains the same as provided by the user.
- `m` remains the same as provided by the user.
- `k` is `k - n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` initially.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` after each iteration.
- `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `t` is `n * s`.
- `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - Initially, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - After each iteration, `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and the current value of `k`.

2. **Determine `t`**:
   - `t` is calculated as `n * s`.

3. **Determine `c`**:
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This means `c` is computed as:
     \[
     c = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} s \times (l[j] + t)
     \]
   - Substituting `t`:
     \[
     c = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} s \times (l[j] + n \times s)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} n \times s \right)
     \]
   - Since `n` is constant and there are `n` terms in the summation:
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n^2 \times s \right)
     \]

4. **Final Value of `c`**:
   - Let `sum_l` be the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - Then:
     \[
     c = s \times (sum_l + n^2 \times s)
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     c = s \times sum_l + s \times n^2 \times s
     \]
     \[
     c = s \times sum_l + s^2 \times n^2
     \]

5. **Convert `c` to an Integer**:
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will convert `c` to an integer before printing it.

### Final Output:
Given the above calculations, the value of `c` is determined by the formula:
\[
c = s \times sum_l + s^2 \times n^2
\]
where:
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` after the loop.
- `sum_l` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **int(s * sum_l + s^2 * n^2)**

This is the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the computation of `c`.
