The provided Python code snippet reads three integer values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the current values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with new values provided by the user. Since the input values are not specified, we will refer to them as `new_n`, `new_m`, and `new_k`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- `n` is reassigned to `new_n`.
- `m` is reassigned to `new_m`.
- `k` is reassigned to `new_k`.

The other variables (`i`, `s`, `c`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `new_n`, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m`, `k` is `new_k`, `s` is the minimum of `new_m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `new_n-1`, `t` is `new_n * s`, `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `int(input())` must be greater than `new_n`.**
