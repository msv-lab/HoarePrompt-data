The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. The value of `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`.**
