You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        t = 0
        
        s = 0
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        
        print(int(c))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as provided by the user, `m` remains the same as provided by the user, `k` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than `m`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration, `c` is the total cost calculated as the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `t` is the total number of tickets bought, which is equal to the initial `k` or the maximum possible tickets that can be bought within the constraints. The list `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to buy (`k`), and a list of prices per ticket for each day (`a`). It returns the minimum cost to buy exactly `k` tickets across the given days, adhering to the daily purchase limit.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
