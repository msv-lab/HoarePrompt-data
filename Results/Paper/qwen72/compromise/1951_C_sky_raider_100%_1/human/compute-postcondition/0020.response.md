Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is `t + 3 * s`, `k` is `k - s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is incremented by `s`.
- The previous value of `t` was `t + 2 * s`, so after adding `s` again, `t` becomes `t + 3 * s`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the update to `t`.
