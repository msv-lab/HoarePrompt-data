To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1` after the loop executes all iterations.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `m` remains an integer.
   - `k` is updated to `k - n * s` after each iteration.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `l`.
   - `m` is an integer that influences the value of `s`.
   - `k` is updated in each iteration, but its initial value is not specified.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and the current value of `k` before each iteration.
   - `c` is the sum of a series of terms where each term is `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the term `s * (l[j] + j * s)` is computed.
   - `s` is the same for all iterations because it is determined once per iteration of the loop.
   - `l[j]` is the `j`-th element of the sorted list `l`.
   - `j * s` is the product of the index `j` and `s`.

4. **Summing Up:**
   - The total sum `c` is the sum of all these terms.
   - Since `s` is constant for each iteration, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     c = s \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] + j \cdot s)
     \]
   - This can be further broken down into:
     \[
     c = s \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + s \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} j \right)
     \]
   - The first part is the sum of the elements in the list `l`.
   - The second part is the sum of the first `n` non-negative integers, which is \(\frac{(n-1) \cdot n}{2}\).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Let `sum_l` be the sum of the elements in the list `l`.
   - Let `sum_j` be the sum of the first `n` non-negative integers, which is \(\frac{(n-1) \cdot n}{2}\).
   - Therefore:
     \[
     c = s \left( \text{sum\_l} + s \cdot \text{sum\_j} \right)
     \]

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the integer value of the calculated `c`.

Output: **int(c) (where c is the sum of s * (l[j] + j * s) for j from 0 to n-1, with s being the minimum of m and k before each iteration, and l being a sorted list of integers provided by the user)**
