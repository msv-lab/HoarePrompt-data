Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer provided by the user, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is 0, `c` is 0, `t` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `c` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `c` while keeping all other variables the same.
