Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
