Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube. In such a case, the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed, depending on its initial position and the positions of other cubes with the same value.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `f = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`
- After sorting: `a = [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`
- The favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3, and the k-th cube (index 2) also has a value of 3.
- The program will output "MAYBE" because `a[k] == x` and `a[k + 1] == x`.

However, in this case, the favorite cube could be in any of the positions 1, 2, or 3 after sorting, and it could either be removed or not removed. The correct output should be "MAYBE" if the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube and there are multiple cubes with the same value. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" in some cases where it should output "MAYBE".
