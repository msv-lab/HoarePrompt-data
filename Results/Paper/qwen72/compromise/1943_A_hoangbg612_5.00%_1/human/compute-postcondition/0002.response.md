Output State: **The value of `cur` is the largest integer such that all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the list `N` and the sum of their counts in `M` is equal to `S`. The variable `M` is a dictionary that maps each integer from 0 to `cur` to its count in the list `N`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `T` remain unchanged.**
