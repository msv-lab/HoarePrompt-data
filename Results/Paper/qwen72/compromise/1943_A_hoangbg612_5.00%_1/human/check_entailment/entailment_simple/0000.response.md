### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted to facilitate the MEX calculation.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each number in `N`.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX is found.
     - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is a valid adjustment because it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present.
   - Another loop iterates from 0 to `cur` to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated. If the count of any number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `cur`, which should be the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the game logic where Alice and Bob take turns. The current implementation simply calculates the MEX of the sorted array, which does not reflect the optimal strategy of both players.
- The dictionary `M` is not necessary for the MEX calculation. The MEX can be determined directly from the sorted array.
- The final loop to adjust `cur` is unnecessary and incorrect. The MEX should be determined by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice and Bob should take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (for Alice) or just removing them (for Bob).
- Alice should always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
- The MEX of `c` should be calculated after all elements are picked.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and MEX calculation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
