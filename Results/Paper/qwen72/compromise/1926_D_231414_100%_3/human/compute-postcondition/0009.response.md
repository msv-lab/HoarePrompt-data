Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first integer in `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR `2147483647`.** 

The value of `s` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `i` (the first integer in `data`) and `2147483647`. All other variables remain unchanged.
