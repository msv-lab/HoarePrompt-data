Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays. The penalty of each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

However, the function `func_1` simply counts the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. The provided function, however, would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is correct in this case but not by the intended logic.

In the fourth test case where `s = "--+++++++-"`, the optimal way to split the array is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, which results in a penalty of `2 + 5 + 1 = 8`. The provided function would return `abs(1 - 9) = 8`, which is again correct but not by the intended logic.

The fifth test case where `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"` is more illustrative. The optimal way to split the array is more complex, and the provided function would return `abs(10 - 10) = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum penalty for this case is `4`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.

Correctness: **False**
