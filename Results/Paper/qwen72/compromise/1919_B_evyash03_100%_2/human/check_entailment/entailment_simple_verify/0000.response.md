Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not equivalent to the process described in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray, then summing these penalties to find the minimum possible total penalty. The provided function `func_1` does not perform any splitting or calculate penalties for subarrays; it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+---
```
The array `a` derived from the string `s` would be `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1]`.

The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is:
- `[1, -1]` (sum = 0, penalty = 0 * 2 = 0)
- `[1, -1]` (sum = 0, penalty = 0 * 2 = 0)
- `[-1, -1]` (sum = -2, penalty = 2 * 2 = 4)

The total penalty is 0 + 0 + 4 = 4.

However, the provided program would output:
```
3
```
This is because it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3` (3 '-' characters and 3 '+' characters).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Convert the string `s` into the array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
2. Iterate through the array to find the optimal way to split it into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

The provided program does not perform any of these steps, and thus, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
