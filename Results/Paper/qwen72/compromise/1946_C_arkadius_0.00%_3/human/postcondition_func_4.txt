The function `func_5` reads input values for integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\), and `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and adds `n-1` edges to it. The tree is then rooted, and the function calls `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as arguments, printing the result of `func_4`. After the function concludes, the tree is fully constructed and rooted, and the result of `func_4` is printed.
