Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case where the tree is not rooted properly. The function `func_5` constructs the tree and roots it using `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`, but the implementation of `root_tree_non_recursive` is not provided. This function is crucial for ensuring that the tree is correctly rooted before the other functions are called. Without a proper implementation of this function, the program may not work as expected for some inputs.

Additionally, the `Tree` class and its methods (like `add_edge` and `vertices`) are not defined in the provided code. This makes it impossible to verify the correctness of the program as it stands, because the behavior of these methods is unknown. For example, if `add_edge` does not correctly add edges to the tree, or if `vertices` does not store the tree nodes correctly, the program will not function as intended.

To be considered correct, the program should include a complete and correct implementation of the `Tree` class and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method.
