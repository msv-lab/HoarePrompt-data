### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are defined in the annotated code, which were missing in the original assessment. This provides a complete structure for the tree.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree by appending the connected vertices to each other's `edges` list.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is implemented and correctly roots the tree. It uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal and sets the parent and children relationships, as well as the subtree sizes, which are crucial for the subsequent functions.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree using a stack. It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex.
   - The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the starting vertex `s`, which is the root of the tree in this context.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is a recursive version of the post-order traversal. It correctly calculates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the subtree rooted at vertex `v`.
   - The function returns the same values as `func_1` but uses recursion instead of a stack.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the entire tree.
   - The conditions for returning `True` or `False` are correctly implemented based on the problem description.

5. **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and satisfy the conditions.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, and the function uses `func_3` to check the conditions for each midpoint.

6. **Function 5 (`func_5`):**
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum value `x`.
   - The input reading and tree construction are correctly implemented.
   - The tree is rooted using `root_tree_non_recursive`, which is correctly defined and implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because it did not consider the complete and correct implementation of the `Tree` class and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method provided in the annotated code. The program, as annotated, correctly handles the tree construction, rooting, and the logic for finding the maximum `x` such that the conditions are satisfied.

**Final: True**
