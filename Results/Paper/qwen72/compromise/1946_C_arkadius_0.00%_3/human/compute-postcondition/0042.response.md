Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`, the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the `stack` will contain the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the vertex `v` in the tree, in the order they were processed. The number of these child tuples will be equal to the number of children of `v`. The other variables (`tree`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
