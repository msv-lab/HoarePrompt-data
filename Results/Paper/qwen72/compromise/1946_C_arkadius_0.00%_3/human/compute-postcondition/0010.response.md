Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`, `u` and `v` are now updated to the integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the integers provided by the user, and the edge is added based on these new values.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains valid.
- The precondition that `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes remains valid.
- The precondition that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 remains valid.
