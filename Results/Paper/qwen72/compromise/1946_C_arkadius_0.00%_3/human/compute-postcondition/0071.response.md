The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of children of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and `u` is the second child of `v`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, and `u` will be the third child of `v`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, where `u` is the third child of `v`**
