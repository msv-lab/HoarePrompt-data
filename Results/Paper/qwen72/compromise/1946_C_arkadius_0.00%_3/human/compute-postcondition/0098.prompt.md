You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object with n vertices, s is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), and x is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `stack` is empty. For each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The initial variables `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the tree. `good_components` is the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` representing a starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of the `good_components` of all children of `s` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`; and `remaining_size`, which is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all children of `s` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the tree. `good_components` is the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
