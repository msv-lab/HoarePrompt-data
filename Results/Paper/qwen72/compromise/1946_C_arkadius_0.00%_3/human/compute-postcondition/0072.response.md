Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, where `u` is the third child of `v`.**

The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to `stack`, where `u` is the third child of `v`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
