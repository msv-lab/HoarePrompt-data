The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input values directly, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The function then reads `n-1` lines, each containing a pair of integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), representing the edges of a tree. After processing this input, the function returns a specific value or result based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function reads input values for integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of a tree. It processes this input and returns a result based on the given data.**
