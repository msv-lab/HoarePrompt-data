The function `func_2` accepts a `Tree` instance `tree`, a non-negative integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the total count of "good" components in the subtree rooted at `v`, where a "good" component is defined as either a child subtree that has a `remaining_size_subtree` greater than or equal to `x` or the sum of all such components in the child subtrees. `remaining_size` is the total size of the remaining components in the subtree rooted at `v` that have a `remaining_size_subtree` less than `x`, plus 1.
