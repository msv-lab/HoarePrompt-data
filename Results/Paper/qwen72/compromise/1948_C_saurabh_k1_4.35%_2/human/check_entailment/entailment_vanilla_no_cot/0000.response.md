Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the robot's movements according to the problem description. The program only checks if the second-to-last cell in the bottom row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) points to the left. This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n) by following the rules:

1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. It must move left, right, up, or down every second.
3. After moving, it must follow the arrow in the current cell.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the robot's starting position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Set to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops
    visited = set()
    visited.add((1, 1))
    
    while True:
        # Determine the next move
        if row == 1:
            if a[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        else:  # row == 2
            if b[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        
        # Check if the robot is out of bounds
        if col < 1 or col > n:
            print('No')
            return
        
        # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            print('Yes')
            return
        
        # Move the robot to the next row based on the current cell's arrow
        if row == 1:
            row = 2
        else:
            row = 1
        
        # Check if the robot is in a visited cell to avoid infinite loops
        if (row, col) in visited:
            print('No')
            return
        
        # Mark the current cell as visited
        visited.add((row, col))

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        can_reach_target(n, a, b)

# Example usage
func()
```

This version of the program correctly simulates the robot's movements and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n) while avoiding infinite loops.
