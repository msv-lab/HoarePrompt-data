The function should accept three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. Each string consists only of the characters '<' and '>', and n is even. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
