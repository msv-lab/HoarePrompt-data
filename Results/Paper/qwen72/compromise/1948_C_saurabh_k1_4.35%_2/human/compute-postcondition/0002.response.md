The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `n` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case. The list of tuples contains pairs of strings, where each string is of length `n` and consists only of the characters '<' and '>'. Each `n` is even, and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to rotate the arrows in the grid such that no arrow points to another arrow in the same column. If it is possible, the function returns "YES" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "NO".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length `n` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. The function returns a list of results, where each result is "YES" if it is possible to rotate the arrows in the grid such that no arrow points to another arrow in the same column, or "NO" otherwise.**
