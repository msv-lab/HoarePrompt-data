Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`.
- The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user input.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `m`, and `_`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.
