Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged. The loop condition (`_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again) is still valid.
