To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the variables and objects that are directly involved in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable that is used to iterate over the range, and it does not need to be adjusted explicitly since it is managed by the loop itself.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is valid and within the specified range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t` for the loop to execute `t` times.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is already defined and within the specified range.
- The loop will execute `t` times if `int(input())` is equal to `t`.
- The loop variable `_` is managed by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state is adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input.
