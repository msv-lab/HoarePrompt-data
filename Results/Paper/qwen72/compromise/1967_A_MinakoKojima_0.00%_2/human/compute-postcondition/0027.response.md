Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, and `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.***
