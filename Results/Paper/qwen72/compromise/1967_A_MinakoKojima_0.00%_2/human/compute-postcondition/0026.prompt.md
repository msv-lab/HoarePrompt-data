Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a`, `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the difference between the second element and the first element of the updated list `a`, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the difference between the second element and the first element of the updated list `a` and then multiplied by the difference between the third element and the second element of the updated list `a`, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the difference between the second element and the first element of the updated list `a` and then multiplied by the difference between the third element and the second element of the updated list `a`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
