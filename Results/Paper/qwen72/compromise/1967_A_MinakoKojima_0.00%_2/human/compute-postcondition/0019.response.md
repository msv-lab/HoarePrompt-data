Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the first element of the updated list `a`, which is `a[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `i` remain as they were after the previous updates.
- Specifically, `ans` is now equal to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, which is the value of the first element in the updated list `a`.
