Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the difference between the second element and the first element of the updated list `a`, `i` is 1.**
