Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
4. `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
5. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
6. `ans` is initially 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range [1, 100].
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`.
   - Otherwise, the following steps are executed:
     - `i` is set to `n-1`.
     - `n` remains unchanged.
     - For each `i` in the range `n`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each iteration.
     - `ans` is set to the product of `a[0]` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the above conditions and updates are applied.

### Determining the Output:
- **Case 1: \( k \geq n * m \)**:
  - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`.
  - The output will be the factorial of `n`.

- **Case 2: \( k < n * m \)**:
  - If `k` is less than `n * m`, then the list `a` is updated in a loop.
  - The value of `ans` is calculated as the product of `a[0]` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.
  - The output will be this calculated product.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the conditions and the structure of the problem, the output will be:

- **The factorial of `n` if \( k \geq n * m \)**.
- **The product of `a[0]` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` if \( k < n * m \)**.

Output: **ans (where ans is the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to n * m, or the product of a[0] and the differences between consecutive elements of a from a[1] to a[n-1] if k is less than n * m)**
