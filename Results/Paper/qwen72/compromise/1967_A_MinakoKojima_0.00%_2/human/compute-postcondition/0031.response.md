Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` with a new list of integers obtained from the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, and `_`) remain unchanged, except that `m` will now be the smallest integer in the newly obtained list `a`.
