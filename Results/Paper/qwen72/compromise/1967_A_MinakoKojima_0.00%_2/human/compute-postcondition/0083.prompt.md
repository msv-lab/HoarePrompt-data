Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `m` is the smallest integer in the updated list `a`, and `ans` is equal to the first element of the updated list `a` multiplied by the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is equal to the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each iteration, and `ans` is the product of `a[0]` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
