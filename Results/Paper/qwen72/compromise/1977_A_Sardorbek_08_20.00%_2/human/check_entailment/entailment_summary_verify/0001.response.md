### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `b == c`:**
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This is correct.
   - **If `b < c`:**
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. This is correct.
   - **If `a % 2 == b % 2`:**
     - This condition is incorrect. The parity of the number of test cases `a` is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - **Else:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs "No". This is correct for the case where `b` and `c` have different parities.

3. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. If they do, it is possible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even (i.e., the number of moves to add and remove cubes must balance out to achieve the desired height).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Evaluation of the Original Program:
- The original program has a logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. This condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to correctly determine if it is possible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
