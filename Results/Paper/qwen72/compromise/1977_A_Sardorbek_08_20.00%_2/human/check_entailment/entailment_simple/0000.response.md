### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates `a` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent `n` and `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result:**
   - The first condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower in each move.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If this is true, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes using only `b` moves, so it prints 'NO'.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. This is incorrect because the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) should not influence the result for each individual test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the parity of `b` and `c` is the same. If the parity of `b` and `c` is the same, it is possible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves, so it should print 'Yes'.
   - The final `else` condition prints 'No' if none of the above conditions are met.

3. **Correct Conditions:**
   - The correct conditions should be:
     - If `b == c`, print 'Yes'.
     - If `b < c`, print 'No'.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, print 'No'.

4. **Output:**
   - The program should output 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, and it does so, but with an incorrect condition in the third case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to check the parity of `b` and `c`. The correct condition should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` instead of `if a % 2 == b % 2:`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
