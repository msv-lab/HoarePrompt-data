Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `a` is the last element in the list `L` (which is undefined since `L` is empty)**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `L` is still an empty list, `tot` remains 0 and `a` is still undefined.
