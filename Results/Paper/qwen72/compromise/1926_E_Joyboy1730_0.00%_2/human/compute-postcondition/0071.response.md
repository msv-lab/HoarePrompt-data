Output State: **`L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a` (from the last iteration), `k` is `k - (tot + a)` (from the last iteration), `pow` is `pow * 2` (from the last iteration), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `L`, `a`, `tot`, `k`, and `pow` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
