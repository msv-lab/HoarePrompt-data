Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n` is 0.
   - `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0.
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `a` is the third element in the list `L`.
   - `tot` is increased by `a`.
   - `k` is updated to `k - tot`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer within the specified range.
   - `n` is 0, so \((n + 1) // 2\) is \((0 + 1) // 2 = 0\). Therefore, `m` is 0.
   - `L` is a list with at least 3 elements. Let's denote the elements of `L` as `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]`.
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `a` is the third element in the list `L`, so `a = L[2]`.
   - `tot` is increased by `a`, so `tot = a`.
   - `k` is updated to `k - tot`, so `k = k - a`.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.
   - We need to substitute the values of `pow` and `k` into the expression.

4. **Substituting Values:**
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `k` is updated to `k - a`, so the expression becomes `4 * (2 * (k - a) - 1)`.

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `2 * (k - a) - 1` simplifies to `2k - 2a - 1`.
   - Therefore, the expression `4 * (2 * (k - a) - 1)` simplifies to `4 * (2k - 2a - 1)`, which further simplifies to `8k - 8a - 4`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `8k - 8a - 4`.
   - Since `a` is the third element in the list `L` and `k` is an integer, the output will be `8k - 8L[2] - 4`.

Output: **8k - 8L[2] - 4 (where k is the value of k and L[2] is the third element in the list L)**
