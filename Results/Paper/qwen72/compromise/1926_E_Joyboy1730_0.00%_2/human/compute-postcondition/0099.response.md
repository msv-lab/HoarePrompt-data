Output State: **`L` is a non-empty list, `a` is the first element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is now equal to `k - (tot + a)`, `tot` is now equal to `tot + a`, and `pow` is now equal to `2 * pow`.**
