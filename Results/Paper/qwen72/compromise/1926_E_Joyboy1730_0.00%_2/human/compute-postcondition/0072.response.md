Postcondition: ***`L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a` (from the last iteration), `k` is `k - (tot + a)` (from the last iteration), `pow` is `pow * 2` (from the last iteration). If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
