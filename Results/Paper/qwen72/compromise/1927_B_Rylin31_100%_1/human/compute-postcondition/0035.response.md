Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.**

Explanation:
- The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `array`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ans` is still defined as a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, but the specific values of `ans` depend on the new `array` and the initial `s` list.
- The new `array` list is populated with the integers provided by the user.
