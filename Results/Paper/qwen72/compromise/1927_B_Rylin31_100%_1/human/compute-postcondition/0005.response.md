The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `array`. For the loop to execute, the list `array` must contain at least one integer. The variable `j` will take the value of each element in `array` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)
- `i` is 0
- `l` is equal to `t`
- `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros
- `array` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `ans` is an empty string

To ensure the loop executes, `array` must have at least one integer. The variable `j` will be set to the first integer in `array` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros, `array` must have at least one integer, `j` is the first integer in `array`, `ans` is an empty string**
