Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a new input integer (which must be greater than 1).
   - `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`.
   - `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is a list of length `l` initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - For each element `j` in `array`, the corresponding element `s[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is constructed by converting each element `s[j]` to a character using the formula `s[j] + 97` and concatenating these characters in the order they appear in `array`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `l = 5` and `array = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]`.
   - Initialize `s` as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - Increment `s` based on `array`:
     - `s[0]` is incremented by 1 (from `array[0]`).
     - `s[1]` is incremented by 1 (from `array[1]`).
     - `s[2]` is incremented by 1 (from `array[2]`).
     - `s[1]` is incremented by 1 (from `array[3]`).
     - `s[3]` is incremented by 1 (from `array[4]`).
   - After these increments, `s` becomes `[1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.
   - Construct `ans`:
     - For `array[0]` (which is 0), `s[0]` is 1, so `ans` gets the character corresponding to `1 + 97` which is `98` (i.e., 'b').
     - For `array[1]` (which is 1), `s[1]` is 2, so `ans` gets the character corresponding to `2 + 97` which is `99` (i.e., 'c').
     - For `array[2]` (which is 2), `s[2]` is 1, so `ans` gets the character corresponding to `1 + 97` which is `98` (i.e., 'b').
     - For `array[3]` (which is 1), `s[1]` is 2, so `ans` gets the character corresponding to `2 + 97` which is `99` (i.e., 'c').
     - For `array[4]` (which is 3), `s[3]` is 1, so `ans` gets the character corresponding to `1 + 97` which is `98` (i.e., 'b').
   - Therefore, `ans` will be the string "bcbcb".

4. **General Case:**
   - For each element `j` in `array`, the corresponding element `s[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - The `ans` string is constructed by converting each `s[j]` to a character using the formula `s[j] + 97` and concatenating these characters in the order they appear in `array`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which is constructed as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`)**
