### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the resulting string.

3. **String Construction:**
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` which will store the final result.
   - For each element `j` in the trace array `array`, it appends a character to `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`.
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which converts the index `s[j]` to a lowercase letter (since `97` is the ASCII value of 'a').
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences for that character.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string `ans` for each test case, it prints the string.

### Analysis:
- **Trace Array Interpretation:**
  - The trace array `array` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the current character at each position.
  - For example, if `array[3] = 1`, it means that the character at position 3 has appeared once before in the string.

- **Character Assignment:**
  - The program uses the `s` array to keep track of how many times each character has been used.
  - When it encounters a trace value `j`, it converts `s[j]` to a character and appends it to `ans`.
  - This ensures that the character at position `i` in `ans` has appeared exactly `j` times before.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the trace array is all zeros (e.g., `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`), which corresponds to a string with all unique characters.
  - It also handles the case where the trace array has values indicating repeated characters (e.g., `0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a string based on the given trace array. It ensures that the number of previous occurrences of each character matches the values in the trace array, and it outputs a valid string for each test case.
