To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`, which means the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
   - `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters).
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `tmp` is an empty string.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop, as it will iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.**
