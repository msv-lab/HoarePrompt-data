Postcondition: ***`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, and `ans` is a string that has been updated according to the rules defined in the initial state. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then the character `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, where `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, and `i` is set to `k - 1`.***
