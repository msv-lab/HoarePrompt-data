Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- `cur_ss` is assigned the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- `ord(ss)` gives the ASCII value of the first character of `s`.
- `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
- The result of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` is stored in `cur_ss`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `cur`, `s`, `ss`) remain unchanged.
