Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` remains the same, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.**
