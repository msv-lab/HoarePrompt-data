Based on the initial state provided:

- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in the string `s`.
- `ans` is a string that has been updated according to the rules defined in the initial state.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
