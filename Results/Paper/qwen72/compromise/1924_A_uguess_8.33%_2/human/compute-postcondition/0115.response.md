The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust these. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. The state of `cur` and `cnt` are also provided, but they are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still be non-empty, and `ss` must be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is now 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.**
