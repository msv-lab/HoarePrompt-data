The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character of `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `ss` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, if the bit corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a' is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to have this bit set.**
