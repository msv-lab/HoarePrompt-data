Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), n and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the current value of `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `ans` is now extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` and then `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a', where `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << (k-1) == 0`). Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, and `ans` is a string that has been updated according to the rules defined in the initial state. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then the character `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, where `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, and `i` is set to `k - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
