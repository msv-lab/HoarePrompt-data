Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged, and if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
