Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `cur` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- The variable `cnt` is still the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`.
- The variable `ans` is still a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
- The variable `cnt` is still less than `n`.
- The loop iterates `k` times, so `i` will be `k-1` after the loop finishes.
- The variable `tmp` will be the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`. If any bit at position `i` in `cur` is 1, `tmp` will remain an empty string.
