Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Counting of Subsequences**: The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, it does not correctly count all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters, but it does not account for the order or the length of the subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by using the bitmask `cur` and the count `cnt`. However, the logic for generating the missing subsequence is flawed. It does not ensure that the generated subsequence is of length `n` and does not correctly handle the case where the subsequence is missing.

3. **Incorrect Use of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of times the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, which indicates that all `k` characters have been seen. However, this does not directly translate to the number of valid subsequences of length `n`.

4. **Incorrect Output for Missing Subsequence**: The program generates a missing subsequence by appending characters in a way that does not guarantee the subsequence is of length `n` and does not correctly handle the case where multiple characters are missing.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is missing, you should print "NO" followed by the missing string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        all_possible_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        
        for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, possible_string):
                print('NO')
                print(possible_string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is missing, it prints "NO" followed by the missing string.
- If all strings are present, it prints "YES".
