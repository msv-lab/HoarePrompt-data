You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the string `s` can be divided into `n` substrings, each containing all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints 'YES'. If it cannot, the function prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string that represents the closest possible valid substring to meet the condition, padded with additional characters as needed. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes `t` being 0, `i` being the total number of test cases processed, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` from the final test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to check all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets to see if they occur as a subsequence in `s`. Instead, it only checks for the presence of all `k` characters in the string `s` and counts how many times this condition is met. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are considered.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The program will output:
```
NO
bb
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
The program fails to correctly identify that the string "aa" is a valid string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence in "abb". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
