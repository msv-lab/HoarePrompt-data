Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ac` is 0, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is 0, which is not greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`). Otherwise, `ac` is 0, which is less than or equal to `bc`.**
