Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32.
- `q` is 1.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- After the loop completes, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s'.
- The current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('A')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply prints the character 'A'. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, `ac`, and `bc` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The condition that `ac` is greater than `bc` is also irrelevant to the output of this particular print statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **A**
