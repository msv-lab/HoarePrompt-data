The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `i` is 'A', `bc` was 0, and if `i` is not 'A', `bc` was 1. After the increment, if `i` is 'A', `bc` becomes 1, and if `i` is not 'A', `bc` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a new string input by the user that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 1. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**
