Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color by performing the specified operations. The function processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it reads the grid and checks certain conditions to decide if the grid can be uniform in color.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first characters of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last characters of each row.
   - The function then checks two conditions:
     - If the first row contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row.
     - If the first column (represented by `first_row`) contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last column (represented by `last_row`).

3. **Output:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the function prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`**
  - This condition checks if the first row contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row.
  - If this is true, it means the first row and the last row have different colors, and since the first row is uniform, it is impossible to change the last row to match the first row using the given operations.

- **Condition 2: `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`**
  - This condition checks if the first column contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last column.
  - If this is true, it means the first column and the last column have different colors, and since the first column is uniform, it is impossible to change the last column to match the first column using the given operations.

### Edge Cases and General Correctness:
- **Uniform Grid:**
  - If the grid is already uniform (all squares are the same color), the function correctly prints 'YES'.
- **Single Row or Column:**
  - For a grid with only one row or one column, the function correctly handles these cases by checking the uniformity of the first and last rows/columns.
- **General Case:**
  - For a general grid, the function's logic is based on the idea that if the first row or first column is uniform and different from the last row or last column, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform. This is because the operations can only affect subrectangles that are already uniform in color, and if the first and last rows/columns are different, there is no way to bridge this difference.

### Conclusion:
The function's logic is sound and covers the necessary conditions to determine if the grid can be made uniform. The conditions are correctly formulated to handle the edge cases and the general case.

Correctness: **True**
