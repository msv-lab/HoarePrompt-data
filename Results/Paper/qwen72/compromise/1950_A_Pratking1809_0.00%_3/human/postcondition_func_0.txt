The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `q` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9) from the user input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and any other variables outside the function remain unchanged.
