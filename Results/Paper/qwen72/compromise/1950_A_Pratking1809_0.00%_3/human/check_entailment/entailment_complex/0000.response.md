Reasoning:
- The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and iterates `q` times.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
- It checks if the digits form a "STAIR" by verifying the condition `a < b < c`.
- It checks if the digits form a "PEAK" by verifying the condition `a < b > c`.
- If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a logical issue in the program:
- The `else` block is directly under the second `if` statement, which means that if `a < b > c` is true, it will print "PEAK" and then "NONE" for the same test case.
- To fix this, the `else` block should be under the first `if` statement, and the second `if` should be an `elif`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Given the original code, the `else` block will always execute if the second `if` condition is not met, leading to incorrect output for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
