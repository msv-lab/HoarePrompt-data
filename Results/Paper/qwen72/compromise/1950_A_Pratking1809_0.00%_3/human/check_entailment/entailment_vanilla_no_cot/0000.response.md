Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the handling of the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". Specifically, the `else` clause is incorrectly placed, which can lead to incorrect outputs. The `else` clause should only be executed if neither the "STAIR" nor the "PEAK" condition is met. However, in the given program, the `else` clause is executed even if the "PEAK" condition is met, which can result in "NONE" being printed incorrectly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the `elif` statement ensures that only one of the conditions is checked and printed, and the `else` clause is only executed if neither condition is met.
