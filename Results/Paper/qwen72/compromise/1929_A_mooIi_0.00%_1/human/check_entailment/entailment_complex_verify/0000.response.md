Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.
3. Print the calculated sum for each test case.

However, the current program only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the required output. The program should instead calculate the maximum beauty by finding the sum of the differences after sorting the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output the sorted array `1 2 3` instead of the maximum beauty value.

Thus, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
