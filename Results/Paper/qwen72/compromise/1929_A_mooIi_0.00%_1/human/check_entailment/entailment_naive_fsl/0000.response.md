Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and then prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output the sorted array `1 2 3` instead of the maximum beauty value.

The program should instead calculate the maximum beauty by finding the maximum possible sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the sum of the differences.
