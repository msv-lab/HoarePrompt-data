Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the binary string `s` as a parameter. However, since the function reads input directly, it is not a critical issue in this context.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. This is a valid approach to handle the input.

3. **Counting Zeroes**: The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of 0s in the string `s`. This is correctly done using `s.count(0)`.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The function uses a list `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far. The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the cost of sorting the string. The logic for updating `ans` is as follows:
   - If the current character `c` is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one 1 encountered before.
   - If the current character `c` is 1, it adds the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the total cost to sort the string.

6. **Algorithm Logic**: The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the cost of each cyclic shift operation. The logic ensures that the cost is minimized by only considering necessary shifts.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The only minor issue is the function definition, but since the function reads input directly, this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
