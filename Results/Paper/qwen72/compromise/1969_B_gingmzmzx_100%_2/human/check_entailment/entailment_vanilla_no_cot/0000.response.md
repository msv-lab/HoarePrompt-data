Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to solve the problem correctly based on the given problem description and the example test cases. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **String Conversion**: Each binary string `s` is converted to a list of integers for easier manipulation.
3. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s as it iterates through the string.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of 0s (`cnt[0]`) and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of 1s (`cnt[1]`) and adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the positions of 0s and 1s and the necessary shifts to bring all 0s to the front and all 1s to the back.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem, and the output matches the expected results for the given example test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
