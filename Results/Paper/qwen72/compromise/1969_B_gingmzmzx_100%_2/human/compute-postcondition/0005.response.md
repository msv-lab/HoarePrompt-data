Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in `s`, `cnt` is a list with values [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The other variables `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
