The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and the loop iterates `n` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 to ensure it is still greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s` before each 1, plus the number of 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`**
