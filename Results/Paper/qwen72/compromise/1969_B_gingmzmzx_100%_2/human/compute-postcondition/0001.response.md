The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
