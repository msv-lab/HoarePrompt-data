Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s` before each 1, plus the number of 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is reset to [0, 0], which means it no longer holds the previous count of 0s and 1s in the list `s`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `ans`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged from the initial state.
