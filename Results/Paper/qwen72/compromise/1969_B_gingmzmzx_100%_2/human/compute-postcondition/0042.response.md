Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 1] if the first integer in `s` is 0 and `c` is 1, or [2, 0] if the first integer in `s` is 0 and `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if the first integer in `s` is 1 and `c` is 1, or [1, 1] if the first integer in `s` is 1 and `c` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is 1, `ans` is increased by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
