Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1 or 0. If `s[0]` is `'1'` and `s[1]` is `'1'`, then `s[0]` is set to `'-1'`, `s[1]` remains `'1'`, and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains `'0'` and `flag` is 0. Additionally, if `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is `'0'`, then `flag` is set to 0 and `s[1]` remains `'0'`. Now, `s[1]` is `'-1'`, and `flag` is 1.**
