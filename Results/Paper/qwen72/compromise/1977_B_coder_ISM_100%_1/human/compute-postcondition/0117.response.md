Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` are both '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `s[0]` is not '1', `s[0]` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 0. In all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.***
