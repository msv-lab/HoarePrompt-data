Output State: **After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first. `flag` is 0.**
