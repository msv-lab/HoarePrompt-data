The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the index `i - 1` is 1. Therefore, the second element of `s` (which was previously either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`) is now set to `'-1'`.

The initial conditions state that the third element of `s` is `'0'`. The condition that if `s[1]` is `'-1'` and `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `s[1]` is updated to `'0'` and `s[0]` remains `'-1'` does not apply here because the code explicitly sets `s[1]` to `'-1'`, which means the condition is not met.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. The third element of `s` is `'0'`, the second element of `s` is `'-1'`, and the first element of `s` remains unchanged.**
