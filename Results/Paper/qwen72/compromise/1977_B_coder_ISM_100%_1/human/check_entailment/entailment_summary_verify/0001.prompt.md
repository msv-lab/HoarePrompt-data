You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) from user input, processes each integer to transform its binary representation according to specific rules, and prints the transformed binary string along with its length. The transformation involves replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' followed by '0', and handling carry-over operations when necessary. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but outputs the transformed binary strings and their lengths.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: For each `x`, it constructs a list `s` of length 30, where each element is either '0' or '1' based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set. This is done using bitwise AND with powers of 2.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**: The function then processes the list `s` to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero (either '1' or '-1'). It uses a flag to track when a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and subsequent elements need to be adjusted accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After processing, the function checks if the last element needs to be adjusted due to the flag being set. If so, it adjusts the last element and possibly appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the length of the list and the list itself.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Representation**: The initial binary representation is correct. Each bit of `x` is correctly identified and stored in the list `s`.

- **Adjusting for Constraints**: The logic for adjusting the list to meet the constraint that no two consecutive elements can be non-zero is complex but generally correct. The flag mechanism ensures that when a '1' is encountered, it is changed to '-1' and the next elements are adjusted accordingly.

- **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments to handle the last element and potentially increase the length of the list are also correct.

- **Output**: The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the length of the list followed by the list itself.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle edge cases where `x` is very small (e.g., 1) or very large (approaching \(2^{30}\)) correctly. The current implementation seems to handle these cases well.

- **Complexity**: The complexity of the function is reasonable for the given constraints. The operations are linear with respect to the length of the list (30), which is manageable.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the logic for adjusting the list to meet the requirements is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
