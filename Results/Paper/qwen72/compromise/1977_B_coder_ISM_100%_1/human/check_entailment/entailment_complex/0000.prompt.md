Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `nalla` is `t - 1`, `x` is the last input integer provided, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements (depending on whether `flag` was set in the last iteration), and `length` is 30 or 31 accordingly. The list `s` contains strings of '1', '0', or '-1', reflecting the transformations applied during the loop. Specifically, any consecutive '1's in the list `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and any '-1' and '1' pairs have been transformed such that the '-1' moves one position to the left and becomes '0'. The final state of `s` will reflect these transformations, with the last element (`s[29]`) potentially being modified based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) from user input, processes each integer to transform its binary representation according to specific rules, and prints the transformed binary string along with its length. The transformation involves replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' followed by '0', and handling carry-over operations when necessary. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but outputs the transformed binary strings and their lengths.
