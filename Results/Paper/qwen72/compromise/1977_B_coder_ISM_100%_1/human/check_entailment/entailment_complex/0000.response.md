Reasoning:

The program aims to convert a given positive integer \( x \) into a sequence of \( a_i \) values where each \( a_i \) is either 1, 0, or -1, and the sum of \( a_i \cdot 2^i \) equals \( x \). Additionally, no two consecutive \( a_i \) values should both be non-zero.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program starts by converting \( x \) into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit.
2. **Handling Consecutive 1s**: The program then iterates through the binary representation to handle consecutive 1s by setting the first 1 to -1 and the next 1 to 0, effectively simulating a carry operation.
3. **Final Adjustments**: The program makes final adjustments to ensure the last bit is correctly handled, including potentially increasing the length of the array if necessary.
4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Binary Conversion**: The initial loop correctly converts \( x \) into a binary representation stored in the list `s`.
- **Consecutive 1s Handling**: The second loop correctly identifies and handles consecutive 1s by setting the first 1 to -1 and the next 1 to 0. This ensures that no two consecutive \( a_i \) values are non-zero.
- **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments ensure that the last bit is correctly handled, and the length of the array is adjusted if necessary.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when \( x \) is 1 or very close to \( 2^{30} \). The program appears to handle these cases correctly.
- **Carry Propagation**: The program correctly propagates the carry through the array, ensuring that the final result meets the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic to transform the binary representation of \( x \) into a sequence of \( a_i \) values that meet the problem constraints. The program handles all edge cases and ensures that no two consecutive \( a_i \) values are non-zero.

Correctness: **True**
