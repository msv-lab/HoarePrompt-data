The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 6. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
