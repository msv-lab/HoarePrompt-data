Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 6.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 6.
- The `print` statement converts `j` to a string, concatenates it with a space, and then concatenates it again with the string representation of `j`.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string "6 6".

### Final Output:
Output: **6 6**
