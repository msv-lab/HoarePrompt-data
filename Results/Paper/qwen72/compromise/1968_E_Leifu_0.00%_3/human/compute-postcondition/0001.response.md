The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. Before the loop starts, `i` must be 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0**
