Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 5.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string "5".
3. The `print` statement concatenates "5" with a space and another "5", resulting in the string "5 5".

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **5 5**
