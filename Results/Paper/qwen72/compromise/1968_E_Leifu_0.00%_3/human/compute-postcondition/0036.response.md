The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'2 4'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n` as input integers, with `t` being between 1 and 50 and greater than 2, and `i` being 2. However, these variables and their values do not affect the `print` statement because the statement is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **2 4**
