The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'2 4'`. The initial state describes that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 50, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. However, these variables and their values do not affect the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of them.

Output: **2 4**
