Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. If the input for `n` is 3, `n` will remain 3. If the input for `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` will be set to `n` in the next step, but `j` is not affected by this code snippet.
