The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'2 3'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as the statement is printing a fixed string.

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer.

None of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement, so they do not influence the output.

Output: **2 3**
