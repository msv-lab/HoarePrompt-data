The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6**
