Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only prints a fixed pattern of points for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\), and for \(n > 3\), it prints a pattern that does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```
This set of points does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
- \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
- \(|2-3| + |4-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
- \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) here is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has 7 elements. However, for \(n = 4\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) can be 10, as shown in the problem description.

A correct approach would involve generating points that ensure all possible Manhattan distances are covered, which is more complex than the fixed pattern used in the provided program.
