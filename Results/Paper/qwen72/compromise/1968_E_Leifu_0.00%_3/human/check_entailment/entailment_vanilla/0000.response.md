Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer `n` and need to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints a set of `n` points.
   - The points are printed in a specific pattern:
     - The first point is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second point is always \((1, 2)\).
     - If `n == 3`, the third point is \((2, 3)\).
     - If `n > 3`, the third point is \((2, 4)\), and the remaining points are \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Pattern:**
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\) and \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has size 2. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 4. This is correct.
   - For \(n > 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to `n`.
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - For points \((j, j)\) where \(j\) ranges from 4 to `n`, the distances between these points and the first three points will be:
         - \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
         - \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2j-3\)
         - \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2j-6\)
       - The distances between the points \((j, j)\) themselves will be \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|\) for \(4 \le j, k \le n\).

4. **Checking the Distinctness:**
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has size 7. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
       - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
       - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 4\)
       - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has size 9. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
       - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
       - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 4\)
       - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
       - \(|1-6| + |1-6| = 10\)
       - \(|1-6| + |2-6| = 9\)
       - \(|2-6| + |4-6| = 6\)
       - \(|4-6| + |4-6| = 4\)
       - \(|5-6| + |5-6| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has size 11. This is correct.

5. **General Case:**
   - For \(n > 3\), the pattern ensures that the distances between the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(4 \le j \le n\) are distinct and cover a wide range of values.
   - The distances between \((j, j)\) points are also distinct and contribute to the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly generates points that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given test cases.
   - The pattern used in the program ensures that the distances are distinct and cover a wide range, which is necessary to maximize the set.

Correctness: **True**
