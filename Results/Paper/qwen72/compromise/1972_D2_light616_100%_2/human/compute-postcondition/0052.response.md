Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 5, `y` is 6, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 55, m // 11)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `y` by 1 in each iteration.
- After the third iteration, `y` is 4. The next iteration will set `y` to 5.
- For the fourth iteration, the condition \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) must still hold true. This means \( (5 + 5) * 5 = 50 \leq n \) and \( (5 + 5) * 5 = 25 \leq m \).
- Since `gcd(5, 5) == 5` (not 1), `cnt` is not incremented in this iteration.
- The fifth iteration sets `y` to 6.
- For the fifth iteration, the condition \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) must still hold true. This means \( (5 + 6) * 5 = 55 \leq n \) and \( (5 + 6) * 6 = 66 \leq m \).
- Since `gcd(5, 6) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 55, m // 11)`.
- After the fifth iteration, the loop terminates because \((5 + 7) * 5 = 60 > n\) or \((5 + 7) * 7 = 84 > m\) (assuming the minimum values for `n` and `m` are 55 and 24, respectively).

Thus, the final state after all iterations is `x` is 5, `y` is 6, and `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 55, m // 11)`.
