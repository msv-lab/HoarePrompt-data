The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two values, `n` and `m`, from standard input, where both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function then processes these values and returns a result based on the input.

Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
