To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Current State:
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` must be at least 10
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` remains unchanged

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **First Condition: `(x + y) * x <= n`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - The condition becomes: `18 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be at least 15, this condition is already satisfied because 18 is greater than 15.

2. **Second Condition: `(x + y) * y <= m`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - The condition becomes: `18 <= m`
   - Since `m` must be at least 10, this condition is not necessarily satisfied because 18 is greater than 10.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `m` must be at least 18.

### Final State:
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` must be at least 18
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` remains unchanged

State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` remains unchanged**
