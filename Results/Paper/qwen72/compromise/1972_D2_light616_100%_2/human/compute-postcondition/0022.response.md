To determine if the loop can execute for the first time, we need to evaluate the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`
- `n` must be at least 9

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
   - Substituting the values: \((3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12\)
   - Therefore, the condition becomes \(12 \leq n\)

2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)
   - Substituting the values: \((3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4\)
   - Therefore, the condition becomes \(4 \leq m\)

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true:
- \(12 \leq n\)
- \(4 \leq m\)

Since `n` must be at least 9, the condition \(12 \leq n\) is already satisfied. The condition \(4 \leq m\) must also be satisfied.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 4.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 9, and `m` must be at least 4**
