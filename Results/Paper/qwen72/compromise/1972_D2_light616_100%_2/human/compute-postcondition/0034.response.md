The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, the conditions for `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `cnt` remain as specified in the precondition.**
