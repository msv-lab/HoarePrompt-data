The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition that the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1 is no longer relevant since `y` has been updated, but the preconditions for `n` and `m` still hold.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 9, `m` must be at least 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
