Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 2, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that (2 + y) * 2 > n or (2 + y) * y > m, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- The value of `y` is recalculated based on the new value of `x` (which is now 2), so `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that (2 + y) * 2 > n or (2 + y) * y > m.
- The value of `cnt` is updated to reflect the new value of `x` (which is now 2), so `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
