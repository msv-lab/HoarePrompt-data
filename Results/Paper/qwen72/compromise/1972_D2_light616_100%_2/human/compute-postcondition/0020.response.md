The variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. If this condition is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented to a value such that `x * x <= n` still holds true. Since `x` is 2, the next value for `x` would be 3 (assuming `x` increments by 1 each iteration).

However, the problem statement does not specify how `x` changes between iterations, but typically in such loops, `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, we assume `x` will be incremented to 3. We need to ensure that `3 * 3 <= n` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and `x` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `x` should be 3. The condition `3 * 3 <= n` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `x` must be 3.
- `n` must be at least 9 (since 3 * 3 = 9).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 3, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that (2 + y) * 2 > n or (2 + y) * y > m, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 9**.
