The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop counter `_` is not used and does not affect the state).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (specifically, it will be `t - 1` from the previous state).
- `func_1()` has been called twice, but this state is not affected by the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice**
