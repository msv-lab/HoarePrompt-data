The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `y`. This changes the value of `y` from its initial state, which was defined as the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(2 + y) * 2 > n` or `(2 + y) * y > m`, to `1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` was initially the smallest integer greater than 1 satisfying certain conditions.
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`.
- `n` must be at least 9.

After executing the code, the only change is in the value of `y`, which is now `1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((2 + y) * 2), m // ((2 + y) * y))` for all pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 9.**
