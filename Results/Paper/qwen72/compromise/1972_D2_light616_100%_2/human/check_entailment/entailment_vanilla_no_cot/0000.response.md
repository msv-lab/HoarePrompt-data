Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The main issue lies in the logic used to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Pair Generation**:
   - The code generates pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are incremented in a nested loop. However, the pairs `(a, b)` should be generated such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. The current logic does not ensure this.

2. **GCD Condition**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is used to check if `x` and `y` are coprime. However, the problem requires checking if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`, which is not directly related to whether `x` and `y` are coprime.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The way the code counts valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. This does not correctly account for all possible pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute `gcd(a, b)`.
3. Check if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition correctly, ensuring that the output matches the problem requirements.
