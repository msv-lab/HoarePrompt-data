You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function then calls another function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function itself does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Pair Generation**: The nested loops generate pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ y ≤ m`. The condition `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m` ensures that the generated pairs are within the specified bounds.

3. **GCD Check**: The program checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is necessary to ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program counts the number of valid pairs using the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each `(x, y)` pair.

5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
