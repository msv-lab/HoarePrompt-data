Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Pair Generation**: In `func_1`, the nested loops generate pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ y ≤ m`. The condition `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m` ensures that the generated pairs are within the specified bounds. However, the loop conditions should be carefully examined to ensure they cover all possible pairs.

3. **GCD Check**: The program checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` using `math.gcd(x, y)`. This is necessary to ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. The GCD check is correctly implemented.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program counts the number of valid pairs using the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This expression correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each `(x, y)` pair. However, the loop conditions and the way pairs are generated need to be verified to ensure they cover all possible pairs.

5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

However, there is a subtle issue in the loop conditions and the way pairs are generated. Specifically, the loop conditions `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` might not cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. For example, if `n` and `m` are large, the loop might terminate prematurely, missing some valid pairs.

To ensure the program is correct, we need to verify that the loop conditions and the way pairs are generated cover all possible pairs. Given the current implementation, it is likely that some valid pairs are missed, especially for larger values of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle all possible pairs due to the loop conditions.

Final: **False**
