You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_1`. The function reads `n` and `m` from standard input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\), `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where gcd(x, y) == 1 and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. It calculates the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x, y, (x + y) * x ≤ n, (x + y) * y ≤ m, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. The function then prints this count. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the count of valid pairs is printed to the standard output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function then calls another function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function itself does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are potential values for \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - The loop conditions ensure that \(x\) and \(y\) are within the bounds defined by \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the gcd to be 1.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the number of valid multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - The logic correctly checks for the gcd condition and counts the valid pairs.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The use of `math.gcd` and the conditions inside the loops ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
