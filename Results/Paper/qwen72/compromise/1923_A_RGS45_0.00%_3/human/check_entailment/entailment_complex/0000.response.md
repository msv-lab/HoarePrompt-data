Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding Chip Positions**: The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (1) and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon. This is correct because:
   - `arr.find('1')` returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string.
   - `arr[::-1].find('1')` returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string, but from the end of the string. The value `y` is then the number of cells from the end to the last chip.

3. **Extracting Substring**: The function extracts the substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` which represents the segment of the ribbon between the first and last chips. This is correct because:
   - `x` is the index of the first chip.
   - `n - y` is the index of the last chip in the original string (since `y` is the number of cells from the end to the last chip).

4. **Counting Free Cells**: The function counts the number of free cells (0) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints this count. This is correct because:
   - The number of free cells between the first and last chips is the number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

5. **Output**: The function prints the number of free cells between the first and last chips for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue with the input handling:
- The function reads `arr` as a string, but the problem description suggests that `arr` should be a list of integers. This could lead to issues if the input is not provided as a space-separated string of '0's and '1's. To ensure the program is robust, it would be better to convert the input string to a list of integers.

Despite this, the function will work correctly if the input is provided as a space-separated string of '0's and '1's, which is a common format for such problems.

Correctness: **True**

However, for better clarity and robustness, the function could be improved by converting the input string to a list of integers. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = input('').strip().split()
        arr = [int(a) for a in arr]
        
        x = arr.index(1)
        
        y = arr[::-1].index(1)
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count(0))
```

This version ensures that `arr` is a list of integers, which is more in line with the problem description.
