### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon. However, `arr` is read as a string, not a list of integers.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (1) in the string `arr`.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (1) in the string `arr` when reversed. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the end of the string.

3. **Extracting the Substring:**
   - The program then extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This substring `z` contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - Finally, the program prints the number of free cells (0) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to count the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is indeed the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
- The logic is sound because moving chips to form a single block without any free cells between them can be achieved by moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are contiguous.
- The substring `z` correctly captures the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the substring `z` will contain only that chip, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Chips Already in a Block:** If all chips are already in a single block, the substring `z` will contain no free cells, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Multiple Free Cells Between Chips:** The program correctly counts the free cells between the first and last chip, which is the minimum number of moves required.

### Issues:
- **String vs. List:** The program reads `arr` as a string, which is not a problem in itself because the operations used (`find` and `count`) work correctly on strings. However, the problem description specifies that `arr` should be a list of integers. This discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the solution but should be noted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples. The only minor issue is that it reads `arr` as a string instead of a list of integers, but this does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
