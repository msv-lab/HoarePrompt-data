The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon, with a_i = 0 indicating a free cell and a_i = 1 indicating a cell with a chip. Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.
