The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value input by the user, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be an integer value input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `t` must be greater than 0**
