The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `arr` from the input, where `arr` represents a ribbon with cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). The function then finds the first and last positions of the chip (1) in the ribbon, extracts the substring between these positions, and prints the number of free cells (0) in this substring. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After all iterations, the initial variables `t` and the list of tuples (if any) will remain unchanged.
