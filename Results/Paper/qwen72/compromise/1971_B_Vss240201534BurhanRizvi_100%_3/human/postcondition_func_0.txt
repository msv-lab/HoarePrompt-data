The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), where each test case includes a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each test case, if the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of `s` (or a modified version if the shuffle resulted in the same string). After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the variable `s` is undefined or reset for each iteration.
