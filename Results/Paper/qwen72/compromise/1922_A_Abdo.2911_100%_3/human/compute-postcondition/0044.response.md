Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions within the loop. If `possible` is True, `possible` remains True. If `possible` is False, `possible` remains False.***
