Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**
