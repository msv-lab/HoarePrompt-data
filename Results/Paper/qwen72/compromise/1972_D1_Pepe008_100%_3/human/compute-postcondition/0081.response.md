Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a sum `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and prints `suma - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `T` is a positive integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the last input, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the last test case, and `suma` is the calculated sum for the last test case. **
