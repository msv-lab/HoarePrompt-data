To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings from the new input
- `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`
- `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 1
- `x` is \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 2
- `b` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\)**
