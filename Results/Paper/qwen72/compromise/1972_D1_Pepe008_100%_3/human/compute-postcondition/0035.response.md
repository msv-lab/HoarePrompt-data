Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than 0, `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`, and the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) is true.**
