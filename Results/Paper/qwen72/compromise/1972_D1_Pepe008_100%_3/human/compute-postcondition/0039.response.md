The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `b`. The loop iterates from `1` to `b` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `b` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). If the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) is true, then `suma` is `a + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `0`.**
