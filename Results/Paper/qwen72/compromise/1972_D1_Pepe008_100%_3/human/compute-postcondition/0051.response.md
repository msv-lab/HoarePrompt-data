Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The variables `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- The variable `T` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `t` remains 1.
- The list `info` remains unchanged, with `a` being the integer value of the first string and `b` being the integer value of the second string in `info`.
- The variable `b` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\). Additionally, for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\), an extra 1 is added to `suma`.
