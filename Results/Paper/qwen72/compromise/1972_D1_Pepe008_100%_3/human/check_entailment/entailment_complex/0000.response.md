Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic

- **Condition for Valid Pairs**:
  - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
    \[
    a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
    \]
  - This implies:
    \[
    a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
    \]
  - Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    a = (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \cdot b
    \]
  - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

- **Program Logic**:
  - The program calculates \(x\) as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\).
  - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but it is not clear why \(i\) is used in place of \(\gcd(a, b)\).
  - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is also not directly related to the problem's condition.
  - The final output `suma - 2` is also not explained and seems arbitrary.

### Conclusion

The program's logic does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The use of \(i\) in place of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and the additional checks are not aligned with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
