Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `k` is a new input integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. The exact values of `a` are not specified, but we know that `a` has at least `2 * n` elements because the precondition mentions `a[j]` for `j` in `0` to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Output of the `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - Since `i` is 1, the statement will print `a[1]` twice.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the input list `a`.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
