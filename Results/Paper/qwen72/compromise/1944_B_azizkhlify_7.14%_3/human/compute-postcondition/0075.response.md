Based on the initial state, we know that `res` is a list with at least 3 elements. The variable `i` is defined as the third element of the list `res`.

When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is the third element of the list `res`. The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the third element of the list `res`)**
