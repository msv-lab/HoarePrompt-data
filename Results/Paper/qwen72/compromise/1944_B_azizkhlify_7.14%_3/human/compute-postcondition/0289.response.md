Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`res`**: This is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
2. **`i`**: This is equal to `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
3. **`n`**: This is an integer greater than 0.
4. **`ul` and `ur`**: These are two values that are not equal. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, `ur` has been increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 for any `i` up to `n`, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: Since `i` is defined as `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2. This means `i` is an index that is out of bounds for the list `a` if `a` has fewer than `i + 1` elements.
2. **`a[i]`**: The print statement attempts to access `a[i]` twice. If `i` is out of bounds, this will raise an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2. If `a` has fewer than `i + 1` elements, accessing `a[i]` will result in an `IndexError`. Therefore, the print statement will not execute successfully and will raise an error.

Output: **IndexError (since `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`)**
