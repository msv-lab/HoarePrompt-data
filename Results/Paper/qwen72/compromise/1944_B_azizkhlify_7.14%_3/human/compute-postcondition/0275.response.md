Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
- `i` is the second element in `res`.

### Explanation:
1. **`res` List**: 
   - `res` is a list that contains elements from another list `a`.
   - These elements are specifically those that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1.
   - The list `res` is populated up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0). This means that `res` contains at most `k` elements.

2. **`i` Variable**:
   - `i` is the second element in the list `res`.
   - Since `res` is non-empty and contains at least one element, `i` must be the second element in this list.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i` followed by a space.

### Output Calculation:
- Since `i` is the second element in the list `res`, and `res` contains elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, the value of `i` will be one of these elements.
- The exact value of `i` depends on the specific elements in `a` and the conditions that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will output the second element in the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is the second element in the list `res`)**
