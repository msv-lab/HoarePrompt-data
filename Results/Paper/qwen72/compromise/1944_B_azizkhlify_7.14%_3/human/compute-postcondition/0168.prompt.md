Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, and `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is 0 or 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, and `k` is non-zero. If `re` is equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, then `res` contains the first element of `a` and `re` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list and `re` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, and `k` is non-zero. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, `res` contains the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), and `re` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list and `re` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 3, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, `k` is non-zero. If `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 1, and `res` contains the first and third elements of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` and `a[3]`). Otherwise, `re` is 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
