Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement. `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
