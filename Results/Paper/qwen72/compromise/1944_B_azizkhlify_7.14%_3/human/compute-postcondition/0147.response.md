Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `k` is non-zero.
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is 0.
   - The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `0` of the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the value of `a[0]` is not explicitly provided, but it is an integer. Therefore, the output will be the integer value at index 0 of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the integer value at index 0 of the list a)**
