Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is incremented by 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is incremented by 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
