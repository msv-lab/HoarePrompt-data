You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    5 3
    
    4 1 1 4 4
    
    1 10
    
    7
    
    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cards_left(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of occurrences of each unique integer in the list `l`. If the maximum count of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the frequency of each unique integer in the list. If the maximum frequency of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to minimize the number of cards left. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will output `2` because it sees that the maximum count of any number is `5`, which is greater than or equal to `3`, and it prints `k - 1` which is `2`. However, the correct output should be `1` because you can perform the operation twice:

1. Exchange 3 cards of `1` for 2 cards of any number.
2. Exchange the remaining 2 cards of `1` plus one of the new cards for 2 more cards of any number.

After these operations, you are left with 1 card. The program fails to consider this scenario and hence is incorrect.
