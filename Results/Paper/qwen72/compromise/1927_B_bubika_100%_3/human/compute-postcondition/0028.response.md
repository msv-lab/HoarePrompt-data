Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the element at index -1 incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one integer, `r` is 'z', `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `x` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value at the index `x` in the list `b` by 1.
- Since `x` is -1, the last element in the list `b` is incremented by 1.
- The list `b` was initially a list of 26 zeros, so after the increment, the last element (index -1) becomes 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.
