The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- The variable `a` is currently a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, the input must be a positive integer, and `t` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`a` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
