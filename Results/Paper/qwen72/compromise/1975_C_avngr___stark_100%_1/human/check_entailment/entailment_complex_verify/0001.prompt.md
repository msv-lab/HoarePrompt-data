You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is equal to `t`, `max` is the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value in the list `a`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, each with its respective `n` and `a`, and the appropriate values have been printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints the minimum of the two elements in the array. This is correct because, in an array of length 2, the only possible operation is to set both elements to the minimum of the two, which is the median.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program initializes `max` to 0.
   - It iterates over the array in subarrays of length 3 (from index `i` to `i + 2`).
   - For each subarray of length 3, it sorts the subarray and checks the median (which is the second element in the sorted subarray).
   - If the median of the current subarray is greater than the current `max`, it updates `max`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all subarrays, the program prints the maximum median found.

### Analysis:
- The problem requires finding the maximum possible value that the array can be uniformly set to using the given operations.
- The key insight is that the maximum value the array can be set to is the maximum median of any subarray of length 3.
- The program correctly identifies and processes subarrays of length 3, which is the smallest subarray that can have a median.
- By sorting each subarray of length 3 and selecting the middle element, the program correctly identifies the median.
- The program then keeps track of the maximum median found and prints it.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n == 2`, the program correctly handles the base case by printing the minimum of the two elements.
- For `n > 2`, the program iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3, ensuring that it considers all potential medians.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value that the array can be uniformly set to using the given operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
