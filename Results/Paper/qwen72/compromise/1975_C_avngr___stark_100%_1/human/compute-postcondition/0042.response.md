The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` is already described as a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order, this operation does not change the state of `temp`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order, `max` is the maximum value between the initial `max` and `temp[1]` if `temp[1]` > `max`.**
