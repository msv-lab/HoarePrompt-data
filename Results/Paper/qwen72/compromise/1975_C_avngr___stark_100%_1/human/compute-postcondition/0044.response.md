Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.** 

The value of `max` is now updated to be equal to the second smallest element in the sorted list `temp`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
