Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
