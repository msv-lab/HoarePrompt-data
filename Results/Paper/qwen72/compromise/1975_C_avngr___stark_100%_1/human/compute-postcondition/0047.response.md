Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` in ascending order, and `max` is the maximum value between the initial `max` and `temp[1]` if `temp[1]` > `max`. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the `temp` variable to a new list containing the elements from `a` starting at index `i` (which is 2) and ending at index `i + 2` (which is 4). This new list is not sorted yet.
- The initial state specifies that `temp` was a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. After the code execution, `temp` now contains the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` but is not necessarily sorted.
- The value of `max` is updated only if `temp[1]` (the second element of the new `temp` list) is greater than the initial `max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `_`) remain unchanged.
