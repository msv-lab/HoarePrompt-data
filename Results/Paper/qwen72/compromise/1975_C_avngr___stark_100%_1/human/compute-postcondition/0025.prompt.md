Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is 0. If `n` is equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or skips the rest of the current loop body.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `temp` is a sorted list containing the first 3 elements of `a` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. If `temp[1]` is not greater than `max`, `max` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. If `temp` is not empty and `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` if `n` is at least 5, otherwise `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. If `temp` is not empty and `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
