Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of `a` of length 3.**

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is within the range 3 to 10^5. The other variables remain unchanged.
