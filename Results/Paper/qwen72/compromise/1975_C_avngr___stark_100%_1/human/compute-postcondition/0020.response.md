The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 (since `n - 2` must be greater than `i`).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. If `temp` is not empty and `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
