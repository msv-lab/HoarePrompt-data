Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `max` is `temp[1]`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`, and the second element of `temp` is greater than the previous value of `max`.**

In natural language: The value of `max` is now equal to the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which contains the first three elements of `a`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
