The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers
- `max` is 0

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` should start at 0. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is 0, `i` is 0**
