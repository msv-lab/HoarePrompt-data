The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
