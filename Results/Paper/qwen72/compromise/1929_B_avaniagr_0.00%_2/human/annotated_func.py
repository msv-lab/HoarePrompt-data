#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and then prints a calculated value based on the given formula. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration, but they are not retained after the loop finishes. The output state does not include the values of `n` and `k` since they are not relevant after the loop. The function `func` remains undefined as it was in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it extracts two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is the printed output for each valid input line.
