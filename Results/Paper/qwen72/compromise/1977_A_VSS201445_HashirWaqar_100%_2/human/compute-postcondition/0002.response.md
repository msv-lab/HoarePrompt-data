The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to work within a context where `t`, `n`, and `m` are predefined or passed in a way that is not shown in the function signature. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function is expected to return a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the description.

Since the exact output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions in a testing context:

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100). For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100) and returns a result based on these inputs. If `t` is outside the valid range, the behavior is unspecified.**
