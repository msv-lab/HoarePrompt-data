Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The conditions for this to be possible are:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to `m` (since he can only add or remove one cube per move).
2. The difference `(n - m)` must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the total number of moves is even.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`. It then checks the two conditions mentioned above:
- `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example.

The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding outputs have been printed based on the conditions specified in the loop.

Correctness: **True**
