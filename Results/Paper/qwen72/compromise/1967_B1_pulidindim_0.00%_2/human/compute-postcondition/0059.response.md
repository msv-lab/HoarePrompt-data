Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n / 5 - 4`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / 5 + 1) + g / count + 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
