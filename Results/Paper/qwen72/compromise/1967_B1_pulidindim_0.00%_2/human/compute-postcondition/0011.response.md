Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is equal to `n / 2 - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins` (which is 1). Therefore, `g` is now equal to `n / 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that if `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, still holds true.
