Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values.***
