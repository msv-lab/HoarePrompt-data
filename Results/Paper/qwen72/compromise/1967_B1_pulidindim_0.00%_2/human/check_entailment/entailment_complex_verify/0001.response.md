### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified as follows:
     - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
     - The condition becomes \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot d} = \frac{d \cdot a' + d \cdot b'}{d \cdot b' \cdot d} = \frac{a' + b'}{b' \cdot d}\) must be an integer.
     - This implies \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the count of valid pairs to \(n\) (which is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1\)).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values by considering the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program uses a variable `countmins` which is set to `count - 1` (i.e., \(b - 1\)).
   - It then calculates \(g = \frac{n}{b}\) and checks if \(g < countmins\). If true, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) to `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The initial value of `ans` being set to \(n\) is correct because all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - The condition \(g < countmins\) is used to break the loop early if no more valid pairs can be found, which is a valid optimization.
   - However, the update to `ans` using the formula \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) is not accurate. This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) because it does not account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) condition properly.

5. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
   - However, this formula does not accurately capture the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) because it does not consider the \(\gcd(a, b)\) condition. Specifically, it does not ensure that \(a' + b'\) is a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used in the loop is not accurate for the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
