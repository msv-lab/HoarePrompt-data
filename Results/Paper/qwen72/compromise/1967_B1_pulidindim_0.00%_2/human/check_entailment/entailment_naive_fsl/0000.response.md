Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is not correct. The number of valid pairs should be initialized to 0, as we are counting pairs that satisfy the condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
   - The calculation `g = n / count` and `g -= countmins` is not correct. The variable `g` should represent the number of valid pairs for a given `b`, but the current logic does not correctly compute this.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition `while count <= m` is correct, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program should iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and count the valid pairs for each `b`.

4. **Incorrect Pair Counting:**
   - The program attempts to count pairs using `ans += g / count + 1`, but this is not the correct way to count valid pairs. The correct approach involves checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

**Example of Incorrect Output:**

For the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

However, the program outputs:
```
4
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
