Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case.
2. **Logic for Bob's Wins**: The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{max\_wins} = \left( \sum_{i=0}^{3} \left( 3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x_i}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( x_i \mod 2 \right) \times (i < 3) \right) \right) // 3
   \]
   where \( x_i \) is the number of occurrences of the integer \( i+1 \) (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4).

3. **Explanation of the Formula**:
   - \( 3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x_i}{2} \right\rfloor \): This term accounts for the pairs of numbers. Each pair of numbers \( i+1 \) (for \( i = 0, 1, 2, 3 \)) can be removed without changing the XOR result, as \( (i+1) \oplus (i+1) = 0 \).
   - \( \left( x_i \mod 2 \right) \times (i < 3) \): This term accounts for the single remaining number if \( x_i \) is odd. For \( i = 0, 1, 2 \), a single remaining number can be used to potentially make the XOR non-zero, which helps Alice win. For \( i = 3 \), a single remaining 4 does not affect the XOR result because \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \).

4. **Sum and Division by 3**: The sum of the above terms is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win. This is because each group of 3 numbers (or pairs of numbers plus one single number) can be balanced to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program will produce the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
