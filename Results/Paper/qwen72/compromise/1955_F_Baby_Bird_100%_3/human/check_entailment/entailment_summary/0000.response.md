### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key insight is to understand how the XOR operation behaves with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
   - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
   - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
   - \(1 \oplus 2 = 3\)
   - \(1 \oplus 3 = 2\)
   - \(1 \oplus 4 = 5\)
   - \(2 \oplus 3 = 1\)
   - \(2 \oplus 4 = 6\)
   - \(3 \oplus 4 = 7\)

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - The function `func` calculates the sum of a modified version of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then performs integer division by 3. This approach is based on the observation that the XOR of a sequence of numbers can be zero if the counts of certain numbers are balanced in a specific way.

3. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the sum is `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
   - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of the same number that can be removed, and each pair contributes 0 to the XOR.
   - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is 1 if `x` is odd and 0 if `x` is even.
   - `(i < 3)` is a boolean that is 1 for the first three numbers (1, 2, 3) and 0 for the fourth number (4).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` for each count `x` and index `i` is calculated.
   - This sum is then divided by 3 to get the result.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the sum is `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`. Dividing by 3 gives `1`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, the sum is `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 0 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 4`. Dividing by 3 gives `1`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, the sum is `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0 = 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`. Dividing by 3 gives `3`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, the sum is `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 0 = 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10`. Dividing by 3 gives `3`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, the sum is `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 1 + 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * 0 = 0 + 0 + 12 + 1 + 12 + 1 + 12 + 0 = 36`. Dividing by 3 gives `12`, which matches the expected output.
