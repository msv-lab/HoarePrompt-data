The function `func` reads a series of test cases, each defined by a list of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts, specifically summing a modified version of these counts and then performing integer division by 3. The function prints the results for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
