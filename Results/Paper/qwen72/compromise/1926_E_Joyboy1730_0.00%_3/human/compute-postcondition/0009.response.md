Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than 1 or less than -1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - m`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than 1 or less than -1.
- `k` is still an input integer.
- `L` is still an empty list.
- `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is updated to `n - m`, which is equivalent to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
