Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than 1 or less than -1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is then updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `m` and `n` depend on the initial value of `n`, but the expressions for their new values are provided.
