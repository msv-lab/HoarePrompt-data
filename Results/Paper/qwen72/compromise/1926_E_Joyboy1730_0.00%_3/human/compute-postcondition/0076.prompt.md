Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `2 * a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (a + a)`, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (3 * a)`, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is `3 * a`, `pow` is 8, `m` is 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
