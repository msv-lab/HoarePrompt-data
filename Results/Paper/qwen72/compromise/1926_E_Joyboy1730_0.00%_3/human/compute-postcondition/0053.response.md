Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0.**

The code snippet `pow = 1` does not change the value of `pow` because it is already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
