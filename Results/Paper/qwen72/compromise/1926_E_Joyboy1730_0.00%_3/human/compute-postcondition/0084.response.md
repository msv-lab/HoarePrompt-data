Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero and greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is `2^0` (which is 1), `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `_` is 1**

Explanation:
- `m` is assigned the value `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `pow` is `2^len(L)`, and since `L` is an empty list, `len(L)` is 0, so `pow` is `2^0` which is 1.
- The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
