Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - a`, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 1, `_` is 1, and if `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
