Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `2 * a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
