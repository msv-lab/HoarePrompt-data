Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0, and `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
