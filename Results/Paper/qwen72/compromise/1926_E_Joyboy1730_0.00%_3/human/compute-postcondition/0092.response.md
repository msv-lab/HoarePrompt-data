The only objects in the loop head are `a` and `L`. For the loop to execute, `L` must contain at least one element. Since `L` is currently an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to have at least one element. The variable `a` will be the first element of the list `L` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 1, `_` is 1**
