The code snippet `temp = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `temp`. This overrides the previous value of `temp`, which was \(2^i\) (where `i` is 0, making `temp` equal to 1). Since the new value of `temp` is explicitly set to 1, the previous calculation of \(2^i\) no longer applies.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, and `k0` is now equal to `k`.**
