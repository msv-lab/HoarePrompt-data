Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, `i` is 0, and `k0` is now equal to `k`. Additionally, `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
