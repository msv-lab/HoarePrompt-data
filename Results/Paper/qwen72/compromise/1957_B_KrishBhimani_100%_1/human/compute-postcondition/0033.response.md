Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `_` is 0.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
4. `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
5. `n` is not equal to 1.
6. `arr` is an empty list.
7. `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` (which is the same as `k`).
8. `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros.
9. `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
10. `temp` is \(2^i\).

### Explanation:
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). This means \(i\) is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- \((1 << i)\) is equivalent to \(2^i\).
- \((1 << i) - 1\) is \(2^i - 1\).
- \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\) is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).

### Constructing the `ans` List:
- The first element of `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\).
- The second element of `ans` is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).
- The remaining `n - 2` elements are zeros.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `k = 10` and `n = 4`:
- The largest integer \(i\) such that \(2^i < 10\) is 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\)).
- \((1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).
- \(k - ((1 << 3) - 1) = 10 - 7 = 3\).
- Therefore, `ans` would be `[7, 3, 0, 0]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*ans)
```
This will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list, the output will be the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), 0, ..., 0 (where the list has n elements, the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining n - 2 elements are zeros)**

For a specific example with `k = 10` and `n = 4`, the output would be:
Output: **7 3 0 0**
