Given the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be satisfied for the loop to continue executing. A `while True:` loop will always execute unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body that causes the loop to terminate.

Since the loop head does not contain any conditions that depend on the state of the program, and the loop is designed to run indefinitely until a `break` is encountered, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
