Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
- If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
- `temp` is \(2^i\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is defined as the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- Since `k` is directly derived from the input list `l1`, it will retain the value of the second element of `l1`.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `k`, which is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list l1)**
