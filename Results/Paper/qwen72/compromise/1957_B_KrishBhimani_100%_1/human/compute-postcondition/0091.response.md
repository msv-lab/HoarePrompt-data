Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is now `temp * 2`, `i` is 1, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
