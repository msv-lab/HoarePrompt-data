The provided code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, assigning this list to `l1`. This operation updates the value of `l1` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here's the detailed impact:

- `l1` is updated to the list of strings obtained from the input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is in `l1`. The new value of `l1` is the list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `l1` is a list of strings from the input.**
