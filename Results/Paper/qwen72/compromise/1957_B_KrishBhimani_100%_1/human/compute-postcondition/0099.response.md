Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`, and `l1` is a list of strings from the input. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `arr` is an empty list.***
