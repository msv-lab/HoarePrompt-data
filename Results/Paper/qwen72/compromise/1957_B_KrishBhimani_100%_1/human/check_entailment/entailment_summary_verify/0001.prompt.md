You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a list of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`. If `n` is 1, the function simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list where the first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is the remainder needed to reach `k`, and the rest are zeros, ensuring the list has exactly `n` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t`, the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case, and the generated list `ans` for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition with a single number is to use `k` itself.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the resulting sequence.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`, where `i` is the exponent of the largest power of 2 found.
   - It appends the remaining value `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads the list `ans` with zeros to ensure it has `n` elements.

4. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - By choosing `(1 << i) - 1`, it ensures that the number has the maximum number of 1s possible for the given `k`.
   - The remaining value is added to the sequence to ensure the sum is `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and using `(1 << i) - 1` is correct for maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation.
- The remaining value is correctly added to ensure the sum is `k`.
- Padding with zeros ensures the sequence has `n` elements.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is very small and `n` is large. For example, if `k` is 1 and `n` is 10, the program will still try to find a large power of 2, which is not necessary. Instead, it should distribute the value of `k` among the first few elements and set the rest to zero.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but could be optimized for edge cases where `k` is very small and `n` is large. However, the core logic is sound and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
