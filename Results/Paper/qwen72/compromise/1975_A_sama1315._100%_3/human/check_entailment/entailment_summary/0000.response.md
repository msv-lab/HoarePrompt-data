### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array, then the array can be sorted using the described operation.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** A list `a` of positive integers.
   - **Process:**
     - The function first sorts the input list `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates the list `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - The function checks if any contiguous subsequence of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such subsequence is found, the function returns 'No'.
   - **Output:** 'Yes' if the array can be sorted by the described operation, otherwise 'No'.
   - **Correctness:** This function is correct because it effectively checks if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array. By concatenating the array with itself, it simulates all possible splits and checks if any of them result in a sorted array.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** Standard input containing multiple test cases.
   - **Process:**
     - The function reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
     - It applies `func_1` to the array `a` and collects the results.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.
   - **Output:** The results of applying `func_1` to each test case, printed on separate lines.
   - **Correctness:** This function is correct because it correctly processes the input, reads the test cases, and applies `func_1` to each array. It also correctly prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the given problem. `func_1` correctly checks if the array can be sorted by the described operation, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each one.

### Correctness:
**True**
