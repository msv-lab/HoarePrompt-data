Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
