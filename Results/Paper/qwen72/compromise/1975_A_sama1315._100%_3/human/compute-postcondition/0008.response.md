Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
- `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop.
- `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `idx` is the index after the last processed element in `data`.
- `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`data`**: This is a list of strings obtained by splitting some input. For example, if the input is `"3 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"`, then `data` would be `['3', '5', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.

2. **`t`**: This is the integer value of the first element in `data`. So, if `data` is `['3', '5', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`, then `t` is `int('3')` which is `3`.

3. **`results`**: This is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to a corresponding list `a`. The list `a` is processed in a loop, and each result is stored in `results`.

4. **`func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know it is applied to each list `a` and produces a result.

5. **`print('\n'.join(results))`**: This statement joins all elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string.

### Explanation:
- Since `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `results` will have `t` elements.
- Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1` applied to a corresponding list `a`.
- The `print` statement will print each element of `results` on a new line.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the results of `func_1` applied to each list `a`, with each result on a new line. Since the exact input and the definition of `func_1` are not provided, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in `results`. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **[result_1]  
[result_2]  
[result_3]  
...  
[result_t] (where each result_i is the result of func_1 applied to the corresponding list a, and t is the integer value of the first element in data)**
