Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers from the user. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. Otherwise, it checks a specific condition involving the best friends' relationships in the list `p`. If the condition is met for any friend, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is not met for any friend, it prints 3. The function does not return any value. **
