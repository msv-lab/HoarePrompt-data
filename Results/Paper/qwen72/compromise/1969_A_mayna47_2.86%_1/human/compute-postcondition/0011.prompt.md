You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop will either print `2` and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything. The values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. If `n` is 2, `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the remaining two elements as integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop will either print `2` and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p`, and returns the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
