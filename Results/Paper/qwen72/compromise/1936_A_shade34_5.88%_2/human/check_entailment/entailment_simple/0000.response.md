### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The function `func()` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index for Bitwise OR:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the index of the element in the permutation that, when combined with itself using the bitwise OR operation, is the largest.
   - The program iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and asks the query `? mak mak i i` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `(p_i | p_i)` is larger, and `mak` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element with the largest value when ORed with itself.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Index for Bitwise OR:**
   - The variable `mak2` is initialized to `mak`. This variable will store the second largest index.
   - The program iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1` and asks the query `? mak mak2 i mak2` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `(p_i | p_mak2)` is larger, and `mak` is updated to `i`, and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `=`, it means `(p_i | p_mak2)` is equal to `(p_mak | p_mak2)`, and `i` is added to `pans`.
   - This step ensures that `pans` contains all indices that, when ORed with `mak2`, produce the same value as `mak`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0. This variable will store the index of the element in `pans` that, when XORed with `mak2`, produces the maximum value.
   - The program iterates through the indices in `pans` and asks the query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` to compare `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`.
   - If the response is `>`, it means `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])` is larger, and `mak` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` is the index in `pans` that, when ORed with itself, is the largest.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the answer to the test case.
   - The output buffer is flushed to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop makes `n` queries.
  - The third loop makes at most `len(pans) - 1` queries, where `len(pans)` is at most `n`.
  - The total number of queries is at most `2n + (n - 1) = 3n - 1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Logic for Finding Maximum XOR:**
  - The program correctly identifies the index `mak` with the largest value when ORed with itself.
  - It then identifies the index `mak2` and a list `pans` of indices that, when ORed with `mak2`, produce the same value as `mak`.
  - Finally, it finds the index in `pans` that, when XORed with `mak2`, produces the maximum value.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 2` correctly by outputting the only possible pair `(0, 1)`.
  - The program also handles the case where multiple indices produce the same maximum OR value by storing them in `pans`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and adheres to the constraints of the problem. It correctly finds a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value and does so within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
