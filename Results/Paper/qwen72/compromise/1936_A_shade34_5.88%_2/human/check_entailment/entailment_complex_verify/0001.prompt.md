You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: _ is t-1, n is the input integer, i is n-1, `mak` is the largest index in `pans` for which the input was '>', `mak2` is the largest index for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the input was '=' or the last index for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` interacts with an external system or user through a series of queries to determine and output two indices, `mak2` and `mak`, from a permutation sequence `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each test case to the standard output. After the function concludes, the output buffer is flushed, and the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the final values of `mak2` and `mak` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).

3. **Finding the Maximum Value:**
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and updates \( \text{mak} \) if \( p_i \) is greater than \( p_{\text{mak}} \).
   - This step ensures that \( \text{mak} \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

4. **Finding the Second Maximum Value:**
   - The second loop iterates over all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}} \).
   - If \( p_i \) is greater than \( p_{\text{mak2}} \), it updates \( \text{mak2} \) and resets the list \( \text{pans} \) to contain only \( i \).
   - If \( p_i \) is equal to \( p_{\text{mak2}} \), it appends \( i \) to the list \( \text{pans} \).

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The third loop iterates over the list \( \text{pans} \) and finds the index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{pans[mak]}} \) is the maximum value in \( \text{pans} \).
   - This ensures that \( p_{\text{mak2}} \) and \( p_{\text{mak}} \) are the two indices that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and \( \text{mak} \) as the answer.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
  - The second loop makes \( n \) queries.
  - The third loop makes at most \( \text{len(pans)} - 1 \) queries, where \( \text{len(pans)} \) is at most \( n \).
  - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)} - 1) \leq 3n \), which satisfies the problem constraints.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies the second maximum value and all indices that are equal to the second maximum value.
  - The third loop correctly identifies the maximum value among the indices in \( \text{pans} \), ensuring that the XOR of the two indices is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem constraints and logic to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The query count is within the allowed limit, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
