Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', and `s` is the input string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to 2, as `i` is 2.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s`) retain their initial values or conditions.
