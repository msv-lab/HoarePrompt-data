Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **`n`**: This is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: This is initialized to 0.
3. **`_`**: This is initialized to 1.
4. **`pans`**: This is an empty list.
5. **`mak`**: This is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution.
6. **`mak2`**: This is equal to `mak`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **`'?'`**: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- **`mak`**: This is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution. Since the exact user input and loop conditions are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `mak`, but we know it is an integer.
- **`mak2`**: This is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
- **`i`**: This is initialized to 0 and has not been modified in the given initial state. Therefore, it will be 0.
- **`mak2`**: This is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.

### Final Output:

The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output will include `mak` twice.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution)**
