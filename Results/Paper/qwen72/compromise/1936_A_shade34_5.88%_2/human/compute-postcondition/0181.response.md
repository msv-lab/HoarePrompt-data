Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is defined based on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0.
     - If `s` is '=', `mak` is not explicitly defined, but since `pans` is `[0]`, we can infer that `mak` might also be 0 (though this is not explicitly stated).
     - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `mak` is not defined in the initial state.
   - `mak2` is not defined in the initial state.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak2` is printed twice, but its value is not defined in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `mak2` is not defined, the print statement will raise a `NameError` when it tries to print `mak2`.

Therefore, the output will be an error message indicating that `mak2` is not defined.

Output: **NameError: name 'mak2' is not defined**
