Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `mak`. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` is also updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
