Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `mak` is either `n-1` or 0.
   - `mak2` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The next two elements printed are `pans[mak]`. Since `mak` can be either `n-1` or 0, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `mak` is `n-1`, then `pans[mak]` is the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.
     - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is the element at index 0 of the list `pans`.
   - The last two elements printed are `pans[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `pans[i]` is the element at index `n` of the list `pans`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `mak` is `n-1`, the print statement will output:
     ```
     '?', pans[n-1], pans[n-1], pans[n], pans[n]
     ```
   - If `mak` is 0, the print statement will output:
     ```
     '?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[n], pans[n]
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `pans[n]` is a valid element.
   - However, the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[n-1]`, and `pans[n]` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe them in terms of their indices.

Output: **'?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[n], pans[n] (where mak is either n-1 or 0, and pans is a list with at least n elements)**
