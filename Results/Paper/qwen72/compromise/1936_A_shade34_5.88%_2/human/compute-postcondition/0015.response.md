Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 3 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `mak` is 0 or 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a detail about the environment, not affecting the print statement directly).
   - If the input string is '<', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are `mak`, which can be either 0 or 2 depending on the input string.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are `i`, which is 3.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the input string is '<', `mak` is set to 2.
   - If the input string is anything other than '<', `mak` remains 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `mak` is 2:
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `mak` is 0:
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the exact input string is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise [mak] is 0)**
