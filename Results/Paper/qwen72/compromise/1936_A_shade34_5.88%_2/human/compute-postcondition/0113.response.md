Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if the new `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. The output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0 if the new `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the new input string.**
