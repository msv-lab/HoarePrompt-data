Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` for which the input was '=' during the loop execution, and the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' (if any).**

The code snippet `mak = 0` resets the variable `mak` to 0, overriding its previous value. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` is also updated to 0. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, and `pans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates.
