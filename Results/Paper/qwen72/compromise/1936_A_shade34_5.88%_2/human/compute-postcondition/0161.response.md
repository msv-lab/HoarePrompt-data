Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` twice, and the value of `i` twice.
   - Since `i` is 3, the last two values will be 3.
   - The value of `mak` will be either 1 or 2, depending on the user input.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is `<`, the output will be: `? 1 1 3 3`.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, the output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.

Given the precondition, we can't determine the exact user input, but we can describe the possible outputs based on the two scenarios.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 2)**
