Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and `s` is the input string.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the console or output stream. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
