Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. **`mak`**: The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as an unknown variable.
3. **`i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 1 in the initial state.

### Output:
The code will print a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is unknown), then the value of `mak` again, and finally the value of `i` (which is 1) twice.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 1 (where [mak] is the value of the undefined variable `mak`)**
