Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<'. It is guaranteed to have at least 3 elements.
   - `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a technical detail that does not affect the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - The next two elements are `pans[mak]` repeated.
   - The last two elements are `pans[i]` repeated.
   - `i` is set to `n`, so `pans[i]` is the same as `pans[n]`.
   - `mak` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the input condition.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If the input was '>', then `mak` is `n-1`.
   - If the input was not '>', then `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', but it is not used in the print statement.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - The value of `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[0]` or `pans[n-1]` depending on the input condition.
   - The value of `pans[i]` will be `pans[n]` since `i` is `n`.

Since `pans` is a list of indices and it is guaranteed to have at least 3 elements, `pans[n]` will be the last element of the list if `n` is the length of `pans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If the input was '>', the output will be: `? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]`.
- If the input was not '>', the output will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]`.

However, since the exact values of `pans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the indices.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[n] pans[n] (where `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, and `pans[n]` is the last element of the `pans` list)**
