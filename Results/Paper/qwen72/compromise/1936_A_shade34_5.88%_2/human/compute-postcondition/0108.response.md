Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
   - `mak` is 0 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is determined based on the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `s` is '<', then `mak` and `mak2` will both be 0.
   - If `s` is not '<', then `mak` and `mak2` will be the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution.

5. **Output:**
   - If `s` is '<':
     ```
     Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
     ```
   - If `s` is not '<':
     ```
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution)**
     ```

Since the exact value of `mak` depends on the user input during the loop execution, we need to consider both cases:

- If `s` is '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 1 0**

- If `s` is not '<':
  Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution)**

To provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is 0 if `s` is '<', otherwise [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution)**
