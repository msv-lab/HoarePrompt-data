Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `mak` is 0
- `i` is 1

The print statement is:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
- The value of `mak` is 0, so it will be printed twice.
- The value of `i` is 1, so it will be printed twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
