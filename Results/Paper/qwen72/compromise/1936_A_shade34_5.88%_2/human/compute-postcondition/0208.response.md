Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and the output state is the same as the initial state.
