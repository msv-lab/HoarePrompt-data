The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '<', `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and `mak2` remains 0.**
