The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `n`. The variable `_` is used as a counter in the loop and is incremented by 1 with each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.

State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
