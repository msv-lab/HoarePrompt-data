Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is the input string.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- If the new `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`.
- If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.
- If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`**:
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string `s`.
   - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1.
   - If `s` is '=', `mak` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer it is not 1.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `mak` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer it is not 1.

2. **Determine the value of `mak2`**:
   - The variable `mak2` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is not possible to determine its value based on the given information.

3. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

4. **Determine the value of `pans`**:
   - The value of `pans` depends on the input string `s`.
   - If `s` is '<', `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is '=', `pans` is `[0, 1]`.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is `[0, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `mak` is either 1 (if `s` is '<') or not explicitly defined (if `s` is '=' or neither '<' nor '=').
- The value of `mak2` is not defined in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `pans` is either `[1]` (if `s` is '<') or `[0, 1]` (if `s` is '=' or neither '<' nor '=').

Since `mak2` is not defined, the print statement will raise a `NameError` when it tries to print `mak2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'mak2' is not defined**
