The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered output is written immediately. However, this does not change the values of any variables or affect the program state in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list**.
