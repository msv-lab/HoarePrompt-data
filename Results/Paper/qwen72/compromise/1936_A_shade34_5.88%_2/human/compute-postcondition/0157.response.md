Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the output buffer, ensuring it is flushed. This action does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program beyond the output buffer. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and the output buffer is confirmed to be flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1, as stated in the initial condition.
