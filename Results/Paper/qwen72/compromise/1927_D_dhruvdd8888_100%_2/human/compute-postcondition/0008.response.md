To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the state and the loop head step by step:

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer value read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(N + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the expression `N + 1` is used to determine the range.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0. This means `N` must be at least 0 (i.e., `N >= 0`).

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
- **`N`**: To ensure the loop executes at least once, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0. The other variables (`s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0**
