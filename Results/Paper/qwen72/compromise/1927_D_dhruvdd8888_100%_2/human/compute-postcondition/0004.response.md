Output State: **`N` is an integer value read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0, `e` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `e` to 0. The values of `N`, `nums`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `e` being 0.
