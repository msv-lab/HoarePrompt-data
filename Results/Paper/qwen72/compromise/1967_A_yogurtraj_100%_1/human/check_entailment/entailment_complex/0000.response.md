### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Reading and Sorting the Cards**:
   - For each test case, the function reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers. It then sorts the list `a`. Sorting is a necessary step to ensure that we can efficiently determine the minimum number of cards of each type and how to distribute the coins.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `r` is initialized to `a[0]`, which is the smallest number of cards of any type after sorting. This is a good starting point for the algorithm.

4. **Coin Distribution and Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `a` to distribute the coins. The goal is to make the number of cards of each type as equal as possible.
   - The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` checks if the current coin budget `k` is sufficient to make the number of cards of the first `i + 1` types equal to `a[i + 1]`.
   - If the condition is true, the function calculates the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending the remaining coins and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is false, the function subtracts the cost of making the first `i + 1` types equal from `k` and updates `r` to `a[i + 1]`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if `k` is not zero, the function calculates the final number of cards that can be made equal by spending the remaining coins.
   - If `k` is zero, the function calculates the final score using the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The algorithm correctly handles the distribution of coins to make the number of cards of each type as equal as possible.
- The final score calculation is based on the number of cards that can be made equal and the remaining coins, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
- The function processes each test case independently and prints the correct result for each test case.
