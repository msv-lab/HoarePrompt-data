Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers.**

The initial state specifies that `t` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0. The code snippet assigns the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` based on the input provided by the user, converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Therefore, after the code execution, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, and the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
