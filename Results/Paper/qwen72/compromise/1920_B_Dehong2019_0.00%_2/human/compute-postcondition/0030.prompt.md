Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[2]`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`, and `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
