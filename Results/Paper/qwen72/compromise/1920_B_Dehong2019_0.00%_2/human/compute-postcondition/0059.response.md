Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans2` remains unchanged, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`. `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
