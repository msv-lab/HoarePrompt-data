Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the first element of `a` minus twice the second element of `a` minus twice the third element of `a`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the third element of the list `a` (since `i` is 2) from `ans1`.
- `ans1` was initially the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the first element and twice the second element.
- After executing the code, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the first element, minus twice the second element, and minus twice the third element.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains sorted in descending order.
