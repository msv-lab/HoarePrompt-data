Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the initial `ans2`**. 

In natural language, the initial state remains unchanged except for `ans1`, which is now the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, plus the value of the first element in the list `a`. The value of `ans` is still the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.
