The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. According to the given state, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, and it will start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
