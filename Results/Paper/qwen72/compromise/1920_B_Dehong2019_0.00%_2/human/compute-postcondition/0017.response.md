Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
