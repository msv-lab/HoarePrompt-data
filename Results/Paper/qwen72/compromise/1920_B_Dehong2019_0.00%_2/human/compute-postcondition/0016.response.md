Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the addition of `a[0]`, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
