The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, two integers `k` and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a modified sum of the elements in `a`. The modification involves subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from the total sum of `a`, then adding the sum of the first `k` elements, and finally subtracting twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` (if these indices are within the bounds of `a`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
