### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd using the condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`. If both are odd, it prints 'NO' because an odd-by-odd rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle. This is correct because any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these cannot form a different rectangle when combined.

2. **Equal Halves Check**:
   - The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other using the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because cutting the rectangle into two equal halves will result in two identical rectangles, and combining them will only form the original rectangle. This is also correct.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES'. This is because if at least one dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and there will always be a way to form a different rectangle by rearranging these smaller rectangles. This is correct because:
     - If `a` is even, it can be cut into two rectangles of size `a/2` by `b`, and these can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a` by `b/2` (or vice versa).
     - If `b` is even, it can be cut into two rectangles of size `a` by `b/2`, and these can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a/2` by `b` (or vice versa).

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, either 'NO' or 'YES', for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle. It handles all the edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
