Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal. For example, for the input `2 2`, the program will output `YES`, but the correct output should be `NO` because cutting a 2x2 rectangle into two 1x2 rectangles and then forming a 2x2 rectangle again does not result in a different rectangle. According to the problem description, if the resulting rectangle is the same as the original, the output should be `NO`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
