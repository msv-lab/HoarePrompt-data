The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one of them is exactly half of the other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `a` and `b` are not retained.
