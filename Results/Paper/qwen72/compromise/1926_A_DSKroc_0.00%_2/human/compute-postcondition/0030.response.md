The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `s`, and `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 1, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1 if `i` is 'B', otherwise `bc` is 0, and `i` is the second character of `s`.**
