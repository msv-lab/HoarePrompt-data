Let's analyze the state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

- The loop condition is `i <= j`.
- Before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true. Given that `i` is 0, the condition will be true if `j` is non-negative. Since `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr)` is at least 1 (as specified by `1 <= len(arr)`), `j` will be non-negative.

Therefore, the loop condition `i <= j` will be true on the first iteration, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
