Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
            j += 1
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False. If the first character of `s` is different from the second character, `count` is updated to 2. Additionally, if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character is '1', `j` is updated to 1 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `count`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `count` is 1 or 2, and `flag` is False or True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a new input binary string with a length of 3 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 or 4, `count` is 1 or 2, and `flag` is False or True. If `s[j-1]` is different from `s[j]`, then `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, the value of `flag` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
