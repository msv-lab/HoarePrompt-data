Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the characters are different. If `flag` is True, `count` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `count` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in `s`, and `flag` is True if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`. If there is no transition from '0' to '1', `flag` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `s` - 1, `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 1, and `flag` remains True. If `flag` is False, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
