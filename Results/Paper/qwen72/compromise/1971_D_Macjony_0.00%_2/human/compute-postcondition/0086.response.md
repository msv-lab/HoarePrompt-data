Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False. If the first character of `s` is different from the second character, `count` is updated to 2. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character is '1', `j` is updated to 1 and `flag` is set to True. If `s[j]` (which is the second character) is different from `s[j + 1]` (which is the third character), `count` remains 2, and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `j` is incremented to 2 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, `j`, `count`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
