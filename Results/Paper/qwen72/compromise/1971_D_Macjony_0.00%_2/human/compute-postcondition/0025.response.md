The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 3 or 4 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), the new value of `j` will be 4 or 5 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 4 or 5 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), `count` is 3 or 4 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), `flag` is True, and `len(s)` must be greater than 4.**
