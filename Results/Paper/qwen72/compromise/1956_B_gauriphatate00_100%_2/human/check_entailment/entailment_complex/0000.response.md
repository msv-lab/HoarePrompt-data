Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and the deck contains two cards for each integer from 1 to `n`. The game proceeds with each player taking turns to place a card on the table, scoring a point if the card matches an already placed card.

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally. Here's the breakdown of the function:

1. **Counting Card Frequencies**:
   - The function first creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand (`a`).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates over the list `a` and updates the dictionary accordingly.

2. **Calculating Maximum Score**:
   - The function then initializes `max_score` to 0.
   - It iterates over each integer from 1 to `n` and checks if that integer appears exactly twice in your hand.
   - If an integer appears exactly twice, it increments `max_score` by 1.

3. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `max_score`, which is the count of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice.

The logic of the function is based on the assumption that you will score a point for each integer that appears exactly twice in your hand, because Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. If an integer appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score a point for it by placing the second card after Nene has placed her card with the same integer.

However, the function does not account for the optimal play strategy of Nene. Specifically, it does not consider the following scenarios:
- If an integer appears exactly once in your hand, you cannot score a point for it because Nene will play her matching card first.
- If an integer appears twice in your hand, you can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same integer on the table before you play your second card.

Given the problem description, the function should consider the optimal play strategy of both players. The current function only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points you can score.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
- Track the cards that Nene has and the cards that are on the table.
- Simulate the game to determine the optimal moves for both players.

Since the current function does not simulate the game and only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice, it does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can score.

Correctness: **False**
