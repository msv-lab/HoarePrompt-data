Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any other value of \( n \) within the specified range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to output a checkerboard for any valid \( n \). For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program should generate a 10x10 checkerboard, but it fails to do so.

Final: **False**
