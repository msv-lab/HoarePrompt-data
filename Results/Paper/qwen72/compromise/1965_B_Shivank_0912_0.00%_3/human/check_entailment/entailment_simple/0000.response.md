Reasoning:

The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case by appending the tuple (n, k) to the list `cases`. Then, it calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of tuples `cases`.

In `func_1`, a fixed sequence is generated using powers of 2, i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to 2^24. This sequence is used for all test cases. The function then appends the tuple (25, sequence) to the `results` list for each test case, indicating that the sequence has 25 elements.

However, this approach is incorrect for the problem because:
1. **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The sequence generated using powers of 2 can form any sum that is a combination of these powers. Specifically, any integer from 1 to 2^25 - 1 can be represented as a sum of a subset of these elements. This means that if k is within this range, there will be a subsequence that sums to k, which violates the first condition of the problem.
2. **Subsequence for All v â‰  k**: The sequence must be able to form all sums from 1 to n, except k. The fixed sequence of powers of 2 can indeed form all sums from 1 to 2^25 - 1, but it does not guarantee that k cannot be formed, which is a requirement of the problem.

To correct this, the sequence needs to be dynamically generated for each (n, k) pair to ensure that no subsequence sums to k while all other sums from 1 to n (excluding k) can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
