The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns a result for each test case, where `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges, and the lists `a_i` and `b_i` contain integers within the specified ranges.**
