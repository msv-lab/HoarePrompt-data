#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers are the same as in `a` but possibly in a different order. `l` is n, `r` is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers are the same as in `a` but possibly in a different order, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order. `ans` was initially calculated in reverse order, so reversing it again returns the cumulative products in the original order of the elements in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` to create a new list `b` with the same elements as `a` but in a potentially different order. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of the elements in `b`. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains these cumulative products.
