Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element. Instead, it appends the elements to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the product in reverse order, which does not match the problem description.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program will produce:
```
24 24 24 24
```

This is because the program does not compute the product of the remaining elements at each step before removing an element. Instead, it multiplies the elements to be removed in reverse order, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to compute the product of the remaining elements at each step and then take the remainder with `m`.
