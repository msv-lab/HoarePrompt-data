Reasoning:  
The provided program processes the commands and outputs the required remainders, but it does not correctly compute the remainders of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step. Instead, it simply appends the elements to a list `b` based on the commands and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to output the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` before each command is executed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Compute the product of the current state of the array `a` before each command.
2. Take the remainder of this product with `m`.
3. Output this remainder.
4. Remove the appropriate element from the array `a` based on the command.

The current implementation does not compute the product of the current state of the array `a` before each command. Instead, it constructs a list `b` and then computes the cumulative product of `b` in reverse order, which is not the same as the required output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
