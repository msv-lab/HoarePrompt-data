Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the processing of the commands and the computation of the remainders.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - The program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1`, which are the indices for the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - For each command in the string `s`, it appends the appropriate element to the list `b` and updates the indices `l` or `r` accordingly.
   - This part of the program correctly simulates the removal of elements based on the commands.

4. **Computing Remainders**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to compute the cumulative product.
   - It iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and appending the result to `ans`.
   - The use of `reversed(b)` ensures that the cumulative product is computed in the correct order, as the elements in `b` are in the order they were removed from `a`.

5. **Returning Results**:
   - The program returns `reversed(ans)`, which reverses the list `ans` to match the order of the commands in `s`.
   - This ensures that the output is the correct sequence of remainders as required by the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1, and when all commands are either 'L' or 'R'.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
