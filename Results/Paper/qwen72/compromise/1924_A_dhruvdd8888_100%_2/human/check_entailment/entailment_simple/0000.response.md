Reasoning:

The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is called without being defined, and when it is defined, it does not take any parameters. This is incorrect because the function should take `n`, `k`, and `s` as parameters to match the problem description.

2. **Logic for Subsequence Check**: The logic inside the function is flawed. The program attempts to find sequences of `k` unique characters in `s` and then checks if the number of such sequences (`ps`) is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Output for NO Case**: The program's logic for generating a string that does not occur as a subsequence is also incorrect. It tries to find a character in `us` that is not in `win` and then constructs a string. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

4. **Use of `win` Set**: The `win` set is used to track unique characters in the current window, but it is cleared every time a set of `k` unique characters is found. This is not the correct approach for checking subsequences.

5. **Random Number Generation**: The random number generation (`rrr = randint(8888, 88888)`) is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and then check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, you should print "NO" and the string that does not occur. If all strings are subsequences, you should print "YES".

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
