Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(n, k, s):
```

**Precondition: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, s is a string of length m (1 <= m <= 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
