The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `us`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `us` set. If the set `us` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first element of `us` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `us`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`**
