#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th unique characters from `s` that are in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was found in `s` and added to `ans`, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop prints a string that concatenates the characters in `ans` with the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters that are within the first `k` letters of the alphabet. If the function finds at least `n` such sequences, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, it prints 'NO' and then constructs a string by concatenating the characters from the sequences found, adding the first unique character from the first `k` letters of the alphabet that is not in the current sequence, and padding the rest of the string with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.
