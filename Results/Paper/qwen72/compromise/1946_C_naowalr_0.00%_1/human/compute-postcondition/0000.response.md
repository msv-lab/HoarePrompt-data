The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the new value of `t` will also be within this range.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree.**
