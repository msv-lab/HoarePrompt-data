Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is now equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `R - L > 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `R` is updated to be equal to the current value of `x`, which is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `R - L > 1` is still valid as it was in the initial state.
