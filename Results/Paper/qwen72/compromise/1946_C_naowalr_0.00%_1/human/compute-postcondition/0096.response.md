The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `b` and `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `z` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the next pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`**
