The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**
