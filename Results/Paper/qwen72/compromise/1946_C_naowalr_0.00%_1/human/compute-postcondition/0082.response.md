Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is `x`. If none of these conditions are met, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0. This update does not affect any other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `numCuts` is now explicitly set to 0.
