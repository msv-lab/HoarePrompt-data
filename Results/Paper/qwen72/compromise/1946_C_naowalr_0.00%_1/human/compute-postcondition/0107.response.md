Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `numCuts` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `L`, `R`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`, and now it is explicitly set to 0.
