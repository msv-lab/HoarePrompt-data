Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `z` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `a` and `b` are updated to the specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[a]`. After appending `a` again, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
