Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from standard input.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`.
- The `map(int, ...)` function converts these input strings to integers.
- The `list(...)` function ensures that `a` and `b` are stored as integers in a list.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid.
