Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `L` is (L + R) // 2.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `x` to `L`.
- Since `x` was previously defined as `(L + R) // 2`, `L` now holds the value `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
