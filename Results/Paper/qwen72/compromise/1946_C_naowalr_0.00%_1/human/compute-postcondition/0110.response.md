Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000.**

Explanation: The code snippet `numCuts = 0` sets the variable `numCuts` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
