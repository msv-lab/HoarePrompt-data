Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is `t - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L` is 1 or less. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is the final value of `x`. Otherwise, `R` is the final value of `x`. The loop has printed the value of `L` for each of the `t` test cases.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: For each iteration, these are the integers read from the input, representing the number of nodes and the maximum number of cuts allowed, respectively.
- **`adj`**: This is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree structure for each test case.
- **`z`**: This is the loop counter, which will be `t - 1` after the loop completes all iterations.
- **`i`**: This is the loop counter for reading edges, which will be `n - 1` after all edges are read for the current test case.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are the last pair of integers read from the input for the current test case.
- **`numCuts`**: This is reset to 0 at the start of each test case.
- **`x`**: This is the midpoint used in the binary search within the loop.
- **`leftover`**: This is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which calculates the remaining nodes after making cuts.
- **`R - L`**: This is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the binary search, which will be 1 or less after the loop completes.
- **`L` and `R`**: These are the bounds of the binary search. After the loop, `L` will be the final value printed for each test case, and `R` will be `L + 1`.
- **Printed Values**: The loop prints the value of `L` for each of the `t` test cases.
