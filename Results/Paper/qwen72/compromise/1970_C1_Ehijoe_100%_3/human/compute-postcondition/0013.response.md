Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory and it now contains `n-1` edges where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys (nodes) from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first node in `ends`, `e` is the second node in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first node in `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first node in `ends` (`s`), `curr` is the first connected node of `s` in `nodes`.**
