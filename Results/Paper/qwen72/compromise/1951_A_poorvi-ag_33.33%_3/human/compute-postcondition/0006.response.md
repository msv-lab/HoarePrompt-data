The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that the current working directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers within a specific range defined by `start` and `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are integers within the specified range [start, end].

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current working directory that are integers within the range [start, end], where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.**
