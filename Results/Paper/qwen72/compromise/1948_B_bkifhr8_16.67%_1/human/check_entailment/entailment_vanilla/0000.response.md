Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Insertion Logic**: The program correctly splits the element into its tens and units digits using integer division (`a // 10`) and modulo (`a % 10`). It then removes the original element and inserts the digits in the correct positions.

4. **Sorting Check**: After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is done using the function `func_1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted and 'No' otherwise.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Single Pass Assumption**: The program only performs the operation once per element in a single pass through the array. This is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` once and then check if the array is sorted, which is not sufficient.

- **Incorrect Insertion Position**: The program inserts the digits in the same position as the original element, but it does not re-evaluate the array after each insertion. This can lead to incorrect results if the array needs to be re-evaluated after each split.

- **No Recursion or Looping**: The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are required to sort the array. It should either use a loop or recursion to repeatedly apply the operation until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
