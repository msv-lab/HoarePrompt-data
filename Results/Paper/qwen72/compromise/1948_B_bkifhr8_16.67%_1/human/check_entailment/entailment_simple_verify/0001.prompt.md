You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Insertion Logic**: The program correctly splits the element into its tens and units digits using integer division (`a // 10`) and modulo (`a % 10`). It then removes the original element and inserts the digits in the correct positions.

4. **Sorting Check**: After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is done using the function `func_1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted and 'No' otherwise.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Single Pass Assumption**: The program only performs the operation once per element in a single pass through the array. This is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` once and then check if the array is sorted, which is not sufficient.

- **Incorrect Insertion Position**: The program inserts the digits in the same position as the original element, but it does not re-evaluate the array after each insertion. This can lead to incorrect results if the array needs to be re-evaluated after each split.

- **No Recursion or Looping**: The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are required to sort the array. It should either use a loop or recursion to repeatedly apply the operation until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
