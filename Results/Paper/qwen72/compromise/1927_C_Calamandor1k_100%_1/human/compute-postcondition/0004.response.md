The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. For each tuple, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively, with elements in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`, based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions for each test case are met.**
