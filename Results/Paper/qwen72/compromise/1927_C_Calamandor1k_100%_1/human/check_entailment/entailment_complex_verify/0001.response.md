### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively. This is correct and efficient for removing duplicates.
   - It then filters these sets to create `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, which contain only the elements that are less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that only the elements within the range [1, k] are considered, which is in line with the problem requirements.
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`). This is done using set operations, which are appropriate and efficient.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements unique to `a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if there are more than `k // 2` elements in `a` that are not in `b`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements unique to `b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case. This is also correct for the same reason.
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements that can be chosen from both arrays (`total_distinct`). This is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
   - If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results list. This is correct because if the total number of distinct elements is less than `k`, it is impossible to choose `k` distinct elements.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is the correct final step.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` with elements in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
  - The sum of values `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.

- **State of the program inside the function:**
  - `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets of unique elements from `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are sets of elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
  - `only_a` and `only_b` are sets of elements that are unique to `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - `both` is a set of elements that are common to both `a` and `b`.
  - The conditions checked in the if statements are logically sound and correctly implemented.

- **State of the program right after the function call:**
  - `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`, based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the unique elements in each array and filters them to include only those that are less than or equal to `k`. It checks the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to choose `k` distinct elements from both arrays such that all integers from 1 to k are included. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem requirements.

**True**
