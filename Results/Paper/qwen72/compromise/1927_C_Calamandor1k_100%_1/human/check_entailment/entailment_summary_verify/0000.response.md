### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is correct and provides a detailed explanation of the logic. Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to verify this claim:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the list `cases`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - It calculates the sets of elements that are only in `a` (`only_a`), only in `b` (`only_b`), and in both `a` and `b` (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of unique elements only in `a` or only in `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If either condition is true, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements (from both sets and the intersection) is less than `k`. If this condition is true, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Condition 1:** The number of unique elements only in `a` should not exceed `k // 2`.
     - This ensures that we can choose at most `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`.
   - **Condition 2:** The number of unique elements only in `b` should not exceed `k // 2`.
     - This ensures that we can choose at most `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`.
   - **Condition 3:** The total number of distinct elements (from both sets and the intersection) should be at least `k`.
     - This ensures that there are enough elements to cover all integers from 1 to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 2, ensuring that there are at least two distinct elements between `a` and `b`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is larger, ensuring that the number of unique elements in each array and their intersection meet the required conditions.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case:
     - `a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]`, `b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]`, `k = 6`
     - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 5, 6}`, `relevant_b = {1, 3, 4, 5}`
     - `only_a = {2, 6}`, `only_b = {1, 4}`, `both = {3, 5}`
     - `len(only_a) = 2`, `len(only_b) = 2`, `total_distinct = 4 + 2 + 2 = 6`
     - Since `len(only_a) <= 3`, `len(only_b) <= 3`, and `total_distinct == 6`, the result is 'YES'.
   - For the second test case:
     - `a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]`, `b = [1, 3, 8, 10, 3]`, `k = 6`
     - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, `relevant_b = {1, 3, 8}`
     - `only_a = {2, 4, 5, 6}`, `only_b = {1}`, `both = {3}`
     - `len(only_a) = 4`, `len(only_b) = 1`, `total_distinct = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6`
     - Since `len(only_a) > 3`, the result is 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of the arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. The function `func_1` accurately checks the conditions and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
