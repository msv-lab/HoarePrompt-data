### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads the input for each test case, storing them in a list `cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements of arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

3. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements unique to `a` (`len(only_a)`) is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements unique to `b` (`len(only_b)`) is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements in both arrays (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) is less than `k`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings. This is consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The conditions used to determine if it is possible to choose the elements are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.
- The program ensures that the number of unique elements in each array does not exceed `k // 2` and that the total number of distinct elements is at least `k`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
