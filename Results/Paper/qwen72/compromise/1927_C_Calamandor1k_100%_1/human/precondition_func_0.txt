t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k, and two lists a and b. For each tuple, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and a and b are lists of integers of lengths n and m, respectively, with elements in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
