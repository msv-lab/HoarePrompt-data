The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function evaluates each tuple to determine if the conditions are met for a specific problem, and returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO'. A 'YES' indicates that the conditions are met, and a 'NO' indicates that they are not. The conditions are: the number of unique elements in `a` that are not in `b` and are less than or equal to `k` should not exceed `k // 2`, the number of unique elements in `b` that are not in `a` and are less than or equal to `k` should not exceed `k // 2`, and the total number of distinct elements in both `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` should be at least `k`.
