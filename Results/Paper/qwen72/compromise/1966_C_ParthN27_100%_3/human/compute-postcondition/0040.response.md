The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate a specific number of times based on the user input. The state of `_` itself does not need to be explicitly adjusted, as it is automatically incremented by the loop mechanism. However, the loop will execute again if the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached yet.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time is the number of iterations left. Since the loop is controlled by the input value, and the input value is not modified within the loop, the loop will execute the same number of times as specified by the initial input.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for the next iteration of the loop, except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n - 1`. If `n` is 2, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop completed all iterations without breaking due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.**
