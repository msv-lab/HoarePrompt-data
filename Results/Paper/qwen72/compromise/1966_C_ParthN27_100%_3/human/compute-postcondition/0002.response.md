Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is initialized by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `arr`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
