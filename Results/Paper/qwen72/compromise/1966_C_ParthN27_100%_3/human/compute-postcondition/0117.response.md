The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('Bob')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bob'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It is a straightforward print of a constant string.
- Therefore, the output will be the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
