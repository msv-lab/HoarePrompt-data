Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an empty set, `i` is `n - 1`. If `n` is 2, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop completed all iterations without breaking due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s.add(arr[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
