Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n - 1`. If `n` is 2, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop completed all iterations without breaking due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.**
