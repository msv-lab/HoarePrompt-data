Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3, `ans` is toggled (1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
