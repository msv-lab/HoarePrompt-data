Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, `i` is `n - 1`.**

The code converts the set `s` into a list, so `s` is now a list containing all the unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index. The other variables remain unchanged.
