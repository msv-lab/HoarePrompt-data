Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1. If `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is set to 0.***
