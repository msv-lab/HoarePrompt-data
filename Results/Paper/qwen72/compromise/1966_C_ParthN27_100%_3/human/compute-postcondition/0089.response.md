Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the integers `arr[n-1]`, `arr[n]`, and `arr[n]`, `i` is `n`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the integer at index `i` (which is `n`) to the set `s`. Since `s` already contains `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`, adding `arr[n]` again does not change the set, as sets do not store duplicate values. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
