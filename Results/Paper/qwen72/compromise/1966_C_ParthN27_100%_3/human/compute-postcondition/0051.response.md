Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is now a list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

The code converts the set `s` into a list, so `s` is now a list containing all the elements that were in the set `s` before the conversion. The elements in `s` are the same as those from `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, but they may no longer be unique and their order is not guaranteed to be the same as in the original set. The other variables remain unchanged.
