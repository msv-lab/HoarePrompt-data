Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty set, after executing this code, `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
