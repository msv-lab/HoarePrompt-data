Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` remains an empty string, `rev_val` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string of `x` (the third element of `operational_list`).
- The length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not checked in this snippet, so `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`) retain their initial values.
