Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing at least one reversed string of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing at least 2 reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is the third element (index 2) of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `x` is 3. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of the third element (index 2) of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is the fourth element (index 3) of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
