Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, and `rev_res` is an empty string.
- The code snippet `list_len, max_power = input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`.
- After this assignment, `list_len` and `max_power` are no longer strings but specific values from the input.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `operational_list`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.
