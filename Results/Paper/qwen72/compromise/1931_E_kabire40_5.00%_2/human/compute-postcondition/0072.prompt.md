Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least one string element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` has at least two string elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the second element of `operational_list` concatenated with itself, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` has at least three string elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
