The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `rev_val`. The loop can execute again if `x` is less than the length of `rev_val`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `rev_val` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `rev_val` must have at least three elements.

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least three elements, `x` is 2**
