Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least two string elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`.
- `x` is the second element of `operational_list`.
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.
- Since the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not checked in the code snippet, the condition for `rev_res` remains unchanged, and it is still an empty string.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
