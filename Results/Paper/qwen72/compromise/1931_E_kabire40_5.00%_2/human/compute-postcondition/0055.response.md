The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `operational_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operational_list`. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a new input string. For the loop to execute, `operational_list` must have at least one string element.

State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least one string element, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`**
