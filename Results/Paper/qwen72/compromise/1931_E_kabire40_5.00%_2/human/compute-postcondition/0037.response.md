Postcondition: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least two elements, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the reversed form of the second element of `rev_val`.**
