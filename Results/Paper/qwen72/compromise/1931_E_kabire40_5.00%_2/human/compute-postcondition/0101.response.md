Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, plus the concatenation of the even-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their integer form and the odd-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their reversed string form. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, then the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`. Otherwise, the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`.**
