Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least one string element, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet reverses the first element of `operational_list` (which is stored in `x`), converts the reversed string to an integer, and assigns this value to `x_rev`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
