#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list, an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining the winning condition, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        
        rev_res = ''
        
        list_len, max_power = input().split()
        
        operational_list = input().split()
        
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        
        rev_val.sort()
        
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
        
    #State: `y` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` is the total number of test cases `t`, `list_len` is the first part of the input string for the last test case, `max_power` is the second part of the input string for the last test case, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string for the last test case, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's rules. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, the output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the output is 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, concatenates those that have the same length as their original form, and sorts the reversed integers that have a different length. It then concatenates these sorted integers, alternating between their reversed and original forms. Finally, it compares the resulting concatenated integer to 10 raised to the power of `m` and prints 'Sasha' if the result is greater, otherwise it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.
