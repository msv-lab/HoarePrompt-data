The function `func` processes a series of input strings. It first reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of strings to process. For each of these strings, it generates a shuffled version `s2`. If `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution. Each string `s` is processed independently, and no state variables are altered outside the loop's scope.
