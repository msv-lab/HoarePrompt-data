You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of input strings. It first reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of strings to process. For each of these strings, it generates a shuffled version `s2`. If `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution. Each string `s` is processed independently, and no state variables are altered outside the loop's scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` using `input()`.

2. **Rearrangement**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - This function returns a list of characters, which is then joined back into a string `s2` using `''.join()`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program checks if the newly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that a random permutation of the string `s` is generated.
  - The comparison `if s != s2` ensures that the generated string is different from the original string.
  - If the generated string is the same as the original string, the program correctly outputs "No".

- **Edge Cases**:
  - For strings with all characters the same (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will correctly output "No" because all permutations of such a string will be the same.
  - For strings with at least two different characters, the program will likely generate a different permutation, ensuring the output is "Yes" followed by a valid permutation.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient for the given constraints (string length at most 10 and up to 1000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
