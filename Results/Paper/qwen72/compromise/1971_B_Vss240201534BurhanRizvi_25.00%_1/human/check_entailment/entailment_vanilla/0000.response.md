### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` using `input()`.

2. **Rearrangement**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - This function returns a list of characters, which is then joined back into a string `s2` using `''.join()`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program checks if the newly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that a random permutation of the string `s` is generated.
  - The comparison `if s != s2` ensures that the generated string is different from the original string.
  - If the generated string is the same as the original string, the program correctly outputs "No".

- **Edge Cases**:
  - For strings with all characters the same (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will correctly output "No" because all permutations of such a string will be the same.
  - For strings with at least two different characters, the program will likely generate a different permutation, ensuring the output is "Yes" followed by a valid permutation.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient for the given constraints (string length at most 10 and up to 1000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
