Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the closest city is not unique. According to the problem description, the closest city to any given city should be unique, which is a constraint that the input must satisfy. However, the program does not enforce this constraint, and it could lead to incorrect results if the input violates this uniqueness condition.

Additionally, the program has a logical error in the `func_1` function where it calculates the cost to travel to the closest city. The function incorrectly updates the `prog_cities` list with a value of 1 when the forward city is closer, but it should instead store the index of the closest city, not the distance. This leads to incorrect calculations in the main loop where the program tries to compute the minimum number of coins required for each query.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

Actual Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

The program might produce the correct output for this specific example, but it will fail for other cases where the closest city is not correctly identified or when the input violates the uniqueness constraint. For instance, if the input is:

Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 16
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program will not correctly identify the closest city for city 4, leading to incorrect results. The correct closest city for city 4 should be city 3, but the program might incorrectly identify city 5 as the closest city due to the logical error in `func_1`.
