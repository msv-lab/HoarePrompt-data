The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5). It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each element `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`, depending on which value is smaller. If the forward difference is smaller, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.
