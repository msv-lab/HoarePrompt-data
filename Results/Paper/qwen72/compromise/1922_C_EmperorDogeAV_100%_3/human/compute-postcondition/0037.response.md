The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, where each integer is between 0 and 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers. Each element `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.
