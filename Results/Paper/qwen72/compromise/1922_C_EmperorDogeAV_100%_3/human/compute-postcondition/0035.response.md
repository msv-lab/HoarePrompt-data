Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, where `n` is the length of the `cities` list.
- For each iteration `i` (from 0 to `n - 2`):
  - `back` is set to the previous city in the list (`cities[i - 1]`) if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains `-99999999999999999999`.
  - `forward` is set to the next city in the list (`cities[i + 1]`).
  - The loop then checks if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.
  - If the condition is true, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1.
  - If the condition is false, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
- After all iterations, `prog_cities` will be a list of `n - 1` integers, where each element is either 1 (if the next city is closer than the previous city) or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
