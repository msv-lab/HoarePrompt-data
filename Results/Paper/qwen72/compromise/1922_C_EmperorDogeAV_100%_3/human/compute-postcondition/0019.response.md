Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 1`. If `i` > 0, `back` is set to `cities[n - 2]`, and `forward` remains 999999999999999999. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999, and `forward` remains 999999999999999999.***
