Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` and `forward` retain their initial values. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `back` remains -99999999999999999999, and `forward` remains 999999999999999999. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[n-1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[n-1]` is set to `999999999999999999 - cities[n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` > 0, `back` is set to `cities[n - 3]` and `forward` is set to `cities[n - 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[n - 1]`. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[n - 2]` is set to `abs(cities[n - 1] - cities[n - 2])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
