The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `cities`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `cities`. The loop iterates `i` from 0 to `n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. However, the loop condition `i in range(n - 1)` will not be satisfied when `i` is `n - 1` because the loop only runs while `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 1`**
