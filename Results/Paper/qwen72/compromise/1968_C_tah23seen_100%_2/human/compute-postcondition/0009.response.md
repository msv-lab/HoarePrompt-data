Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 6**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` updates the value of `ans[i]` to be the result of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000, except for the element at index `i` which is updated by the code.
- The value of `i` is `n - 6`, so the element at index `n - 6` in `ans` is updated to `ans[n - 5] - arr[n - 6]`.
- All other elements in `ans` remain 1000000000.
- The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The initial state for `arr`, `n`, and `i` remains valid.
