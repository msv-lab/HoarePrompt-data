Output State: **arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, ans is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000.**

The list `ans` is now initialized to a list of length `n`, with each element set to 1,000,000,000. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
