Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to generate an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that for each \( 2 \le i \le n \), \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \). The provided solution initializes the array `ans` with the maximum possible value \( 10^9 \) for all elements. Then, it iterates backward through the array `arr` to set each element \( a_i \) (for \( 2 \le i \le n \)) to \( a_{i+1} - x_i \).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The formula \( a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i \) is incorrect because it does not ensure that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \). Instead, it should be \( a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i \) for some integer \( k \) such that \( a_i \) is greater than \( a_{i-1} \).

The correct approach should be:
- Start with \( a_n \) as a large number (e.g., \( 10^9 \)).
- For each \( i \) from \( n-1 \) to 2, set \( a_i \) to \( a_{i+1} - x_i \) is incorrect. Instead, set \( a_i \) to \( a_{i+1} + x_i \).

Let's correct the function `func_1` to ensure the correct behavior:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] + arr[i]
    return ans
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended. The corrected function ensures that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) by setting \( a_i \) to \( a_{i+1} + x_i \), which guarantees that \( a_i \) is greater than \( a_{i-1} \) and the remainder when \( a_i \) is divided by \( a_{i-1} \) is \( x_i \).

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
