### Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a mapping from characters in `encoded` to lowercase Latin letters. However, this is not how the decoding should work according to the problem description.
   - The correct approach should be to construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then use this string to perform the symmetric replacement.
   - The current implementation incorrectly maps each character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' without considering the symmetric replacement rule.

2. **Symmetric Replacement**:
   - The problem requires that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`. For example, if `r = "cdefors"`, then 'c' should be replaced by 's', 'd' by 'r', 'e' by 'o', and so on.
   - The current implementation does not construct the string `r` and does not perform the symmetric replacement. Instead, it maps each character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order they appear, which is not the correct decoding logic.

3. **Handling of Unique Characters**:
   - The program assumes that each character in `encoded` should be mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'. This is incorrect because the decoding should be based on the symmetric characters in the auxiliary string `r`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem. It fails to construct the auxiliary string `r` and perform the symmetric replacement, leading to incorrect results.
