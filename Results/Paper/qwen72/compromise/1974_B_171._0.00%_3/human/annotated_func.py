    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `encoded` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and each value is a character from `encoded`. `decoded` is a list of characters where each character is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`. If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, the last 26 characters of `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters in `mapping`, and the `decoded` list will contain the corresponding keys for all characters in `encoded`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the result of joining all characters in the `decoded` list, where each character in `decoded` is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`. If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, the last 26 characters of `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters in `mapping`, and the `decoded` list will contain the corresponding keys for all characters in `encoded`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each character in `encoded` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter. If `encoded` contains more than 26 unique characters, only the last 26 unique characters are mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the decoded string will reflect these mappings. The original `encoded` string remains unchanged.
