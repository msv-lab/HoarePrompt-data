The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'. The conditions for the loop to continue executing are that `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` (97) to `ord('z') + 1` (123).

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not present in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping['a']` is set to the second character in `encoded`, and the character 'a' is now present in the values of `mapping`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `encoded`, `char`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
