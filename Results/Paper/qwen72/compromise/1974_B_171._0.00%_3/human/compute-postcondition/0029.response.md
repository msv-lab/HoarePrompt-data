The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which is from 97 to 122 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 98. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping['a']` is set to `char`, and the character 'a' is now present in the values of `mapping`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `encoded`, `char`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
