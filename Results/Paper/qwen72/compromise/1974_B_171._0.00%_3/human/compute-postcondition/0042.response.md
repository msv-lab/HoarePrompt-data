To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `c`, and the range defined by `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The loop will execute if `c` is within this range. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Range of `c`**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` (which is 97) to `ord('z') + 1` (which is 123). This means `c` must be an integer starting from 97 and ending at 122 (inclusive).

2. **Initial Value of `c`**: The initial value of `c` should be 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. This is already given in the state.

3. **State of `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `mapping`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted. However, they are important for the loop's behavior, and we need to ensure that the loop can potentially break or update `mapping` based on the conditions provided.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters.
- `char` is the third character in `encoded`.
- `decoded` is a list.
- `c` is 97.

We need to ensure that `c` is within the range specified by the loop head, and the loop can execute at least once. The loop will break if a condition is met, but that is not something we need to adjust in the state.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 97, and the loop will execute if `c` is within the range from 97 to 122 (inclusive)**.
