Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char`, `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a', and `c` is 97.**
