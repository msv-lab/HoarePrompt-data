Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`, `c` is 97, and `mapping` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. Since `char` is the third character in `encoded` and it is already in `mapping`, `decoded` now contains the value `mapping[char]`. The variable `c` remains 97, and `mapping` remains unchanged because the code only appends to `decoded` and does not modify `mapping` or `c`.
