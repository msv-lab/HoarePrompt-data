Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `encoded` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and each value is a character from `encoded`. `decoded` is a list of characters where each character is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`. If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, the last 26 characters of `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters in `mapping`, and the `decoded` list will contain the corresponding keys for all characters in `encoded`.**

In simpler terms:
- `encoded` is unchanged.
- `mapping` contains a mapping of up to 26 lowercase Latin letters to characters in `encoded`.
- `decoded` is a list of characters where each character is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`.
- If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, only the last 26 unique characters in `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the `decoded` list will reflect these mappings for all characters in `encoded`.
