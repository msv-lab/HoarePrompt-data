Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the character with ASCII value `c`, `c` is the ASCII value of the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values, or 123 if all lowercase Latin letters are already in `mapping` values. If the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values is found, `mapping` is updated such that this letter maps to `char`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
