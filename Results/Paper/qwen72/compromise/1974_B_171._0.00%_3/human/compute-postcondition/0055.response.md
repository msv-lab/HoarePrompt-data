Output State: **The `encoded` string remains unchanged, `char` is still the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list that may or may not have been modified depending on the loop execution, and `c` is 123. If the loop found a lowercase Latin letter that was not present in `mapping` values, `mapping` contains a new key-value pair where the key is the first such letter and the value is the third character in `encoded`. If no such letter was found, `mapping` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The `encoded` string and `char` (the third character in `encoded`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- The `decoded` list may or may not have been modified depending on whether the loop found a lowercase Latin letter that was not present in `mapping` values.
- The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' (97) to 'z' (122). If the loop finds a letter that is not in `mapping` values, it updates `mapping` and breaks out of the loop. If it completes all iterations without finding such a letter, `c` will be 123 (the ASCII value of the character after 'z').
- If a letter is found and added to `mapping`, the loop breaks, and the final state of `c` will be the ASCII value of the letter that was added plus one. However, if no letter is found, `c` will be 123.
