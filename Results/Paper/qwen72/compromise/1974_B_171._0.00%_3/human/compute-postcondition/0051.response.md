The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which is from 97 to 122 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 to 99.

The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state do not affect the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` (i.e., 'c') is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'c' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.**
