Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. The `answers` list contains strings representing the pairs of cards that were matched and removed from the `suits` dictionary, sorted by rank. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for any suit that had a pair of cards removed, and the remaining unmatched card ranks for the other suits.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
