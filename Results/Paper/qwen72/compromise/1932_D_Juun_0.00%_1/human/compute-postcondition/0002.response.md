Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. Each card string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"). The input has been read, and the value of `trump` is now a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"). The variable `trumps` is an empty list.**
