Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `i` > 0, `back` is now equal to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` < `n - 1`, `forward` is now equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is now equal to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])` modifies the value of `prog_cities[i]`.
- The value of `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i` < `n - 1`.
- The value of `cities[i]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `prog_cities[i]` is now the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain as specified in the initial state.
