Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` > 0 and `i` < `n - 1`, then `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.***
