Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.**
