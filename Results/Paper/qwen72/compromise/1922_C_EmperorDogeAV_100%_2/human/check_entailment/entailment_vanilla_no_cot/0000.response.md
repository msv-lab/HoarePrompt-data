Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city and the cost to travel to that closest city. However, the logic in the function is flawed:
     - The `back` and `forward` variables are initialized with extremely large and small values, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
     - The function should only consider the distance to the immediate previous and next city, not the entire list.
     - The function should return the cost to travel to the closest city, which is always 1 coin, but it incorrectly calculates the distance to the closest city.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `prog_cities`:**
   - The `prog_cities` array should store the cost to travel to the closest city, which is always 1 coin. Instead, the function is storing the distance to the closest city, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city. However, since the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin, the prefix sums should simply be the number of steps required to reach the target city, not the distances.

4. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The program is not correctly handling the queries. It should use the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`, but the current implementation is not doing this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Determine the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) <= abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]):
            closest_cities[i] = i - 1
        else:
            closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    
    # For the first and last city, the closest city is always the next or previous one
    closest_cities[0] = 1
    closest_cities[n - 1] = n - 2
    
    # Calculate prefix sums for forward and backward travel
    pref_sum_f = [0] * n
    pref_sum_b = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        pref_sum_f[i] = pref_sum_f[i - 1] + abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
    
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        pref_sum_b[i] = pref_sum_b[i + 1] + abs(cities[i] - cities[i + 1])
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        a, b = a - 1, b - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        if a < b:
            # Travel forward
            cost = 0
            while a != b:
                if closest_cities[a] == b:
                    cost += 1
                    break
                cost += 1
                a = closest_cities[a]
            print(cost)
        else:
            # Travel backward
            cost = 0
            while a != b:
                if closest_cities[a] == b:
                    cost += 1
                    break
                cost += 1
                a = closest_cities[a]
            print(cost)
```

This corrected version correctly determines the closest city for each city and calculates the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the closest city information.
