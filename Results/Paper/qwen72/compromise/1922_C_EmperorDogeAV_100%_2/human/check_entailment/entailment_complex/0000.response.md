### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i` (from 0 to `n-2`), it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city (indicating the direct travel cost).

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program computes prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` for the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` is computed for the original `cities` list.
   - `pref_sum_b` is computed for the reversed `cities` list.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are the same city by ensuring `a != b` in the input constraints.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the closest city is unique for each city, as required by the problem statement.

6. **Logical Flaws:**
   - The function `func_1` has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the closest city. Specifically, it should only consider the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`), and not the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
   - The correct logic should be:
     ```python
     if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
         prog_cities[i] = 1
     else:
         prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
     ```
   - This ensures that `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the previous city (if the previous city is closer).

7. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program's logic for handling queries and computing prefix sums is correct.
   - However, the function `func_1` has a logical error in determining the closest city, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the `func_1` function, which affects the computation of the closest city and, consequently, the prefix sum arrays. This can lead to incorrect results when processing queries.
