The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length, and returns a 2D list `p` of integers. Each element `p[i][j]` in the returned list `p` contains the sum of all elements in `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the element at position (i-1, j-1). The function does not modify the input list `l`.
