Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - However, the constructed string `s` of length `k * n` does not necessarily contain all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences.
   - For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The program constructs the string `baab`, which does indeed contain all these subsequences. However, for `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program constructs the string `abcbac`. This string does not contain all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`). Specifically, it does not contain `aa`, `bb`, or `cc` as subsequences.

4. **Checking the Constraints**:
   - The constraints are `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.
   - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`, which is within the feasible range given the constraints. However, the correctness of the solution is not guaranteed by this alone.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output is `ab`, which contains all possible strings of length 1 using the first 2 characters (`a` and `b`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output is `aa`, which contains the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 character (`a`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `baab`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `abcbac`, which does not contain all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 characters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution does not correctly generate a string `s` that contains all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters as subsequences.
   - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, but this does not guarantee the inclusion of all required subsequences.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
