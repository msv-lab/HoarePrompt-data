Reasoning:

The program's goal is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, calls `func_1` to generate the required string.

However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it should take `n` and `k` as parameters to generate the string based on these values. This is a critical issue because the function needs to know the values of `n` and `k` to produce the correct output.

2. **String Construction**: The function constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating them `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets will occur as subsequences in `s`.

   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function will return `'ababab'`. However, the string `'cc'` (which is a valid string of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets) is not a subsequence of `'ababab'`.

3. **Correct Approach**: To ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`, the string `s` should be constructed in a way that it includes all combinations of the first `k` alphabets of length `n`. One way to achieve this is to generate a de Bruijn sequence of order `n` on an alphabet of size `k`.

   - A de Bruijn sequence of order `n` on an alphabet of size `k` is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring (and thus as a subsequence).

4. **Example**: For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, a valid de Bruijn sequence of order 2 on the alphabet `a, b, c` is `'abcbac'`. This sequence contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets as subsequences: `aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, cc`.

Given the issues with the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
