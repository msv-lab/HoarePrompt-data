Precondition: **The function should take two integers a and b as inputs, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for a and b. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
