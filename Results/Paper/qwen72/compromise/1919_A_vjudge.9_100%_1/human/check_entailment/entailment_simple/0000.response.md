### Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins in each wallet.

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - If both wallets have the same number of coins, the game is symmetric, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means Bob will always win if the game starts with an even number of moves (since Alice makes the first move, and the game ends with an even number of moves if the initial number of coins is the same).

2. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets differ by an even number, the game will always end with an even number of moves, and Bob will win.
   - If the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets differ by an odd number, the game will always end with an odd number of moves, and Alice will win.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is based on the parity analysis, which is correct.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as described in the problem statement.
   - The program will always produce the correct result for any valid input within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, which is the key to solving the problem.
