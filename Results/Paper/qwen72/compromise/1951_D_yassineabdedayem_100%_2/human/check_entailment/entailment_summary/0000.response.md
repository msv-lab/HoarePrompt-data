Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up one stall with the price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy `k` jewels and spend exactly `k` coins.
   - **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints 'YES', 2, and the values `n - k + 1` and 1. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending `n - k + 1` coins) and the remaining `k - 1` jewels from the second stall (spending `k - 1` coins). The total spent will be `n - k + 1 + k - 1 = n` coins, and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if `n + 2 <= k * 2`, it means that Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. Specifically, if `n + 2 <= k * 2`, then `n < k * 2 - 2`, which implies that even if Bob sets up the most optimal stalls, Alice will not be able to buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Format**: The function adheres to the output format specified in the problem. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall when applicable.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, or if `n` is small and `k` is large, the conditions will correctly determine whether it is possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
