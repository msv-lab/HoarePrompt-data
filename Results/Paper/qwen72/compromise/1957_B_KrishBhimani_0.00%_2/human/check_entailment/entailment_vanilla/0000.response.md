### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of these integers should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a list `arr` that contains the positions of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final sequence.
   - It iterates through the positions in `arr` and sets the corresponding bits in the sequence `ans` to 1, ensuring that the sum of the sequence does not exceed `k`.
   - If the sequence has fewer than `n` elements, it appends zeros to make the length of the sequence equal to `n`.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - `for _ in range(int(input())):` reads the number of test cases.
     - `l1 = input().split()` reads the input for each test case and splits it into a list of strings.
     - `(n, k) = list(map(int, l1))` converts the list of strings to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`.

   - **Constructing `arr`:**
     - `arr = []` initializes an empty list to store the positions of set bits.
     - `k0 = k` stores the original value of `k` for later use.
     - `i = 0` initializes a counter for bit positions.
     - `while k:` iterates through the bits of `k`.
     - `if k & 1 == 1:` checks if the least significant bit of `k` is set to 1.
     - `arr.append(i)` appends the position of the set bit to `arr`.
     - `k = k >> 1` shifts `k` right by one bit to check the next bit.
     - `i += 1` increments the bit position counter.

   - **Constructing `ans`:**
     - `ans = []` initializes an empty list to store the final sequence.
     - `c = 0` initializes a counter to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.
     - `for i in arr:` iterates through the positions of set bits.
     - `if c == n - 1:` checks if the sequence has `n-1` elements.
     - `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the remaining value to `ans` to ensure the sum is `k`.
     - `break` exits the loop to prevent adding more elements.
     - `c += 1` increments the element counter.
     - `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value with the bit at position `i` set to 1.
     - `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to `ans` to make its length equal to `n`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` by appending the remaining value when the sequence has `n-1` elements.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s because it sets the bits in the positions where `k` has 1s.
   - The sequence is constructed to have exactly `n` elements by appending zeros if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
