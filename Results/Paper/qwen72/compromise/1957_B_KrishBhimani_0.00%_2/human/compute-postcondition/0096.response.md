Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to `l1`.
- The initial state already specifies that `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, so this part of the state is confirmed.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the confirmation that `l1` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.
