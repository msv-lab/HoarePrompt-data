Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns `ans` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
