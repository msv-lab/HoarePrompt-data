Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 1`, if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, a new element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `ans`. `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 2`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 3`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
