Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `arr` will contain the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary 1101), `arr` will be `[0, 2, 3]`.
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `l1` remains the list of strings obtained from the input.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` will be 0 after the loop has executed all iterations, as it is right-shifted until no bits are left.
- `k0` remains the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- `i` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, which is the same as the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `c` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `ans` is a list that contains the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`. This ensures that `ans` represents the binary decomposition of `k0` with the correct number of elements.
