The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (using integer division). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (using integer division) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros. If the original `k` (now `k0`) was an odd number, `arr` contains `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `arr` contains `[1]`.**
