Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `c` is 2. `ans` now contains the value `1 << i` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The value `1 << i` is calculated and appended to the list `ans`.
- The initial state of `ans` is not specified, so we assume it could be an empty list or already contain some elements.
- If `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`, `ans` would have contained the values `k0`, `1 << i`, and `- (1 << i)`. Now, `1 << i` is appended to this list.
- If `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, `ans` would have contained the value `1 << i`. Now, `1 << i` is appended to this list, making it contain two instances of `1 << i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
