Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `ans` contains the values `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`. `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- `ans` initially contains the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`.
- The sum of `ans` is `2 * (1 << i)`.
- The new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - 2 * (1 << i)`.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
