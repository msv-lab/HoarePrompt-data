The variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (using integer division).

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero. Since `k` is the result of an integer division of the second element in `l1` by 2, and `k0` (the second element in `l1`) is non-zero, the only way to ensure `k` is non-zero is to ensure that `k0` is at least 2 (since 1 divided by 2 using integer division results in 0).

Therefore, `k` must be non-zero, and `k0` must be at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (using integer division) and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing the element 0.**
