Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (using integer division) and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing the elements [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the element 0.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated by performing a right shift operation (`k >> 1`), which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 using integer division.
- Initially, `k` was the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2. After the right shift, `k` is now the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
