Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`, and `ans` now contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` already contains an element which is `1 << i`.
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` adds a new element to `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k0` minus the sum of the elements already in `ans` before the new element is added.
- The sum of the elements in `ans` before the new element is added is `sum(ans[:-1])`, which is the sum of all elements in `ans` except the last one.
- Therefore, the new element added to `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from the initial state.
