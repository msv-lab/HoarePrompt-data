The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
