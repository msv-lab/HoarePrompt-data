#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration are provided by the user. For each iteration, the conditions checked within the loop remain the same: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 1`; if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 3`; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated based on the loop, and `a` is checked against `z`. The final output state will reflect the results of these checks for all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the user. It then checks the following conditions for each test case: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'; if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO'; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` and prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `z`, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
