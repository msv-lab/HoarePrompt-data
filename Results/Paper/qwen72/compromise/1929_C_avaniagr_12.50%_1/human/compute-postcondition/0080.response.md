Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the user. It then checks the following conditions for each test case: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'; if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO'; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` and prints 'YES' if `a` is at least `z`, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
