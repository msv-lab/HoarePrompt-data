Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user.
4. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
5. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for variables `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these conditions and values do not affect the `print` statement in any way.
- The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Output: **YES**
