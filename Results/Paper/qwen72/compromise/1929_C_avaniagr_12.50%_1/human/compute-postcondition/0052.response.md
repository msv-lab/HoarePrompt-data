Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `x` must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided by the user, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`), the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a` is less than `z`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.***
