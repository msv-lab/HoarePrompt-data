The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be at least 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `x` must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided by the user, `z` is 1, `i` is 1**
