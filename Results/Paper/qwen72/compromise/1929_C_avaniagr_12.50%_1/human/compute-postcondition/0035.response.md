Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided to understand what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user.

### Conditions:
1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.

2. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`:
   - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
     - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`.
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
     - `z` is `x + 1`.
     - `i` is `x`.
     - `x + 1` is greater than `x`.
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `x + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is a simple print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, or `a`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
