The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case from the `cases` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.**
