Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`:
     - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:
       - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
       - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`.
     - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
       - `z` is `x + 1`.
       - `i` is `x`.
       - `x + 1` is greater than `x`.
       - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
       - If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `x + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement.

Given the conditions and the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute and print 'YES' regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. The conditions provided do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly; they only describe the relationships between the variables.

Output: **YES**
