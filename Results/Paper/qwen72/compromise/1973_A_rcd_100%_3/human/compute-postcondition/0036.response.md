Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed by the `print(-1)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `y` is set to `p1`.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`.
- If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the new input values.

### Analysis:
1. **Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even**: This means that the sum of the three integers is divisible by 2.
2. **Condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`**: If this condition is true, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
3. **Condition `p3 < p1 + p2`**: If this condition is true, `y` is set to `p1`.
4. **Condition `p1 - (p3 - p1) <= p2 - (p3 - p1)`**: This simplifies to `2 * p1 - p3 <= p2 - p3`, which further simplifies to `2 * p1 <= p2`. If this condition is true, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Loop continuation**: If the above conditions are not met, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.

### Given Code:
```
print(-1)
```

### Conclusion:
The `print(-1)` statement is outside of any conditional logic or loop. It is a standalone statement that will always execute, regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`, `y`, or `x`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
