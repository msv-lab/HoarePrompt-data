To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where \( 0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30 \).
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers with the given constraints.
   - `t` and `_` are not used in the `print` statement, so they are irrelevant.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even is a condition that must be satisfied.
   - `p3` is at least 4.

2. **Unknown Variable:**
   - The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value.

3. **Expression:**
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` involves `p1`, `x`, and `p3`.
   - Since `x` is undefined, the output of the `print` statement will depend on the value of `x`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `x` is not defined in the initial state, the output of the `print` statement cannot be determined precisely. The expression `p1 - x + p3` will result in an error if `x` is not defined.

Output: **Error (variable 'x' is not defined)**
