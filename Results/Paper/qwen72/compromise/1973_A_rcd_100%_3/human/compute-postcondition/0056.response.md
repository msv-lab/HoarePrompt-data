The variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `y >= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is set to `p3 - 2` and `x` is set to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

Given that `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2, the smallest possible value for `p3` is 2. If `p3` is 2, then `y` would be `p3 - 2` which is 0. However, `x` is 2, and `y` (0) is not greater than or equal to `x` (2), so the loop would not execute again. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `p3` must be greater than 2, so that `y` (which is `p3 - 2`) is at least 2.

Thus, `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4 for `y` to be greater than or equal to `x`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4**
