Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `_` is `t - 1`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues with the same values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. Otherwise, the loop completes, and `p3` is printed. After all iterations, `x` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `y` is `p3 - x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will still be the integers provided by the user, constrained by 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of these scores will always be even. The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop continues with the same values. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop will check if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` at any point. If this condition is met, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. If the condition is never met, the loop completes and `p3` is printed. After all iterations, `x` will be the number of times the loop has executed, and `y` will be `p3 - x`.
