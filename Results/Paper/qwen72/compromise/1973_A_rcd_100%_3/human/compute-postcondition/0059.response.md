Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4.**

The value of `_` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
