Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`. If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.***
