Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the program's failure to handle the case where \( 1 < k < n \). The program only prints -1 in this scenario, which is incorrect because it is possible to construct an array that meets the requirements. For example, an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, k, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1] \) can have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

Let's break down the reasoning further:

1. **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program prints \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is correct. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.

2. **Case \( k = n \)**:
   - The program prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \), which is correct. All cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

3. **Case \( 1 < k < n \)**:
   - The program prints -1, which is incorrect. It is possible to construct an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. One such construction is \( [1, 2, \ldots, k, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1] \). This array will have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts:
     - The first \( k \) elements form a sorted segment.
     - The remaining \( n - k \) elements form a segment that, when shifted, will not create a sorted array unless the shift aligns with the sorted segment.

### Example:
For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \):
- The array \( [1, 2, 1, 2] \) has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts:
  - \( [1, 2, 1, 2] \) (sorted)
  - \( [2, 1, 2, 1] \) (not sorted)
  - \( [1, 2, 1, 2] \) (sorted)
  - \( [2, 1, 2, 1] \) (not sorted)

Thus, the program's logic is flawed in the case where \( 1 < k < n \).

Final: **False**
