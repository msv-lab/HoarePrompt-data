Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Array Constraints**: Each element \( a_i \) must satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Sorted Cyclic Shifts**: Out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array \( a \), exactly \( k \) of them must be sorted.
3. **Output**: For each test case, print a valid array \( a \) or -1 if no such array exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads input from standard input and processes each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all lines from standard input and processes each line starting from the second one.
   - Each line contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If \( k \geq 2 \)**:
     - **If \( n == k \)**:
       - The program prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \).
       - This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.
     - **Otherwise**:
       - The program prints -1.
       - This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of constructing a valid array when \( k < n \) and \( k \geq 2 \).

   - **If \( k < 2 \)**:
     - The program prints an array where elements are \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
     - This is a valid solution because:
       - For \( k = 1 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.
       - For \( k = 0 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) has no sorted cyclic shifts other than itself, which is not possible since \( k \) must be at least 1.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
  - The program correctly prints an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
  - This is correct.

- **Case \( k = n \)**:
  - The program correctly prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \).
  - This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.

- **Case \( 1 < k < n \)**:
  - The program incorrectly prints -1.
  - This is incorrect because it is possible to construct an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. For example, an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, k, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1] \) can have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( 1 < k < n \) properly. It should be able to construct a valid array for such cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
