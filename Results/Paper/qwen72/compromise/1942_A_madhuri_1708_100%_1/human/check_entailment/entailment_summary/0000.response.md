Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program provided attempts to solve this problem with the following logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input from the standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t`. Each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling `k` >= 2**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, the program prints a sequence of `k` integers, each equal to `k`. This is correct because if `n` equals `k`, then all `n` cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted, and an array with all elements equal (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`) will satisfy this condition.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, the program prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it is possible to have an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts even if `n` is not equal to `k`. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Handling `k` < 2**:
   - If `k` is less than 2, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because if `k` is 1, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (itself). If `k` is 0, the problem is not solvable, but the program does not handle this case explicitly, which is fine since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect for the case where `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`. The program should be able to generate an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for such cases, but it incorrectly prints `-1`.

Correctness: **False**
