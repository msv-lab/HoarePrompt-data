Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the array `a`. However, there are a few issues and misunderstandings in the implementation:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but the function itself reads the input directly, which is not ideal for testing and reusability. It should take `n` and `arr` as parameters.

2. **MEX Calculation and Permutation Construction**: The program's logic for constructing the permutation `p` is flawed. The MEX value is not being calculated correctly, and the permutation is not being constructed in a way that satisfies the given condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

3. **Handling Negative Values**: The program does not handle negative values in `arr` correctly. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix of `p`, and the permutation should be constructed such that the given condition holds for all elements in `arr`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the MEX values instead of the permutation `p`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
