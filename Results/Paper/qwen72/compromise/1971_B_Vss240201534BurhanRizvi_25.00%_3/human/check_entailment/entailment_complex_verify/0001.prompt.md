You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times for different test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input provided. For each iteration, a string `s` will be read from the input, and a shuffled version `s2` of `s` will be created. If `s2` is different from `s`, 'Yes' will be printed followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, 'No' will be printed. The variables `s` and `s2` will be updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and checks if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is different, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input `t` has been processed, and for each of the `t` test cases, a shuffled string has been generated and compared to the original string, with the appropriate message printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s` for each one.

2. **Random Shuffling**: The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a shuffled version of the string `s`. This function returns a new list containing all the elements from `s` in a random order, and then `join` is used to convert this list back into a string `s2`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program checks if `s2` is not equal to `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" and the shuffled string `s2`.
   - If `s2` is equal to `s`, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If the string `s` has only one character, `random.sample(s, len(s))` will always return the same string, so the program will correctly print "No".
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same, `random.sample(s, len(s))` will also always return the same string, so the program will correctly print "No".
   - **Multiple Possible Answers**: If there are multiple possible answers, the program will print one of them, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

5. **Randomness**:
   - The use of `random.sample` ensures that the program has a chance to generate a different string `s2` from `s` if `s` has at least two different characters.
   - However, there is a small chance that `s2` might be equal to `s` even if `s` has different characters, but this is not a problem because the program will eventually find a different string if it runs multiple times. For the given problem constraints (string length at most 10), the probability of this happening is very low.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" followed by the string `s2` if applicable, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output format. The use of randomness is appropriate for the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
