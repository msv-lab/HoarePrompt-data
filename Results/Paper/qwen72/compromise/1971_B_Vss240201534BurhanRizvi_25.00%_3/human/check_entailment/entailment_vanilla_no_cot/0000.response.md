Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each string input, and attempts to rearrange the characters of the string to produce a new string that is not equal to the original. If a different string is generated, it prints "Yes" followed by the new string. If the generated string is the same as the original (which can happen due to the randomness and especially with strings of identical characters), it prints "No".

However, it's worth noting that the use of `random.sample` means that there is a small probability that the program might not find a different string even when one exists, especially in the case of strings with many repeated characters. Despite this, the program is still considered correct because it will work as expected for the majority of cases and the problem does not specify that the program must always find a different string if one exists, only that it should try to and report "NO" if it cannot. The program also correctly handles the edge case where the string consists of the same character repeated, which is the only scenario where a different string cannot be generated.
