The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which is used to determine the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as this will determine the number of times the loop runs. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but the input must be provided and must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Given the problem description, the function `func` should take a single string `s` as input, and the function should be called multiple times based on the integer `t`. The state needs to reflect that `t` is a positive integer and that the function `func` is correctly defined to accept a string `s`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `_` is a placeholder variable, `func` is defined to take a single string `s` as input where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10**
