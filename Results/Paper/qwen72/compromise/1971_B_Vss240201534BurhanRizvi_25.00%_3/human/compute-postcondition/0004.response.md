Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and checks if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is different, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input `t` has been processed, and for each of the `t` test cases, a shuffled string has been generated and compared to the original string, with the appropriate message printed for each case. **
