Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count` is 0.
- `count2` is 0.
- `done` is False.
- `j` is 0.
- The character at the `j`-th position in `s` is not equal to the character at the `(n - 1 - j)`-th position in `s`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **1**
