Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, `done` remains False and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.***
