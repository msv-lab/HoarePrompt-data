The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the loop itself. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
