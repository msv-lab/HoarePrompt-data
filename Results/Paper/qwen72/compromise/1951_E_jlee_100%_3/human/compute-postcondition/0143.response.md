Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.***
