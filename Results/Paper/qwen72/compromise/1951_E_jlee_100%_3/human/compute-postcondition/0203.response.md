Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `done` remains False.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` will be `string[:0 - 1]`, which is `string[-1]`. This means it will take the substring from the start of the string to the character before the last character (i.e., the entire string except the last character).
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be `string[0 - 1:]`, which is `string[-1:]`. This means it will take the substring from the last character to the end of the string (i.e., just the last character).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first part of the print statement, `string[:j - 1]`, will be the entire string except the last character.
   - The second part of the print statement, `string[j - 1:]`, will be the last character of the string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[string except the last character], [last character of string]**
