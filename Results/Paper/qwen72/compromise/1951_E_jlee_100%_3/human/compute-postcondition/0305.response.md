Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `string` is an input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. `x` is the first character of `s`.
7. `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
8. `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`.
9. `done` is False.
10. If `n` == 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'YES'.
- The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the print statement.
- The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES', regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
