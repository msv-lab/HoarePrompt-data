Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` (with `done` being True if `count2` is greater than `count`, and `done` remaining False if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1). If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1 and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `count` remains 0 and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `done` retains its original value and `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 2, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is checked against `count`: if `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
