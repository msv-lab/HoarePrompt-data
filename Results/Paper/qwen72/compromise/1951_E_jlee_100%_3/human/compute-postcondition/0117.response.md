The `print(string)` statement will print the value of the `string` variable, which is an input string provided in the initial state. The initial state does not specify the exact content of the `string`, only that it is an input string from which a list of characters `s` is derived.

Output: **[string] (where [string] is the input string provided in the initial state)**
