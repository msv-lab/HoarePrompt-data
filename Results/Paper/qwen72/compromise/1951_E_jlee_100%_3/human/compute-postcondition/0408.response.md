Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.***
