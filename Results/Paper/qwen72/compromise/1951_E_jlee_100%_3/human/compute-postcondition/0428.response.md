Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` retains its initial value.**
