Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, and `x` appears exactly `n - 1` times in `s`. Additionally, either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`.**
