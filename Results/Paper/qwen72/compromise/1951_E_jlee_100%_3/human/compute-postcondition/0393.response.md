Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `j` is set to 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `s[j]` is the second character of `s`.
   - `s[n - 1 - j]` is the second-to-last character of `s` (since `j` is 1, `n - 1 - j` is `n - 2`).

3. **Logic:**
   - The code checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` (the first character of `s`) and `count` is less than 1. If this condition is true, `count` is set to 1.
   - The code then checks if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If they are equal, `done` is set to False. If they are not equal, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will split the `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` is the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j` (which is 1).
     - `string[j:]` is the substring from the character at index `j` (which is 1) to the end of the string.

### Output:
- Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
- `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the second character of `string` to the end.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
