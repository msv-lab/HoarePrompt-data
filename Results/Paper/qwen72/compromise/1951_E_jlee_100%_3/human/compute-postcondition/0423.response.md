Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is either 0 or 2 (depending on the initial condition), `done` is either False or True (depending on the initial condition), `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `done`, and `count2` remain the same as in the initial state.
