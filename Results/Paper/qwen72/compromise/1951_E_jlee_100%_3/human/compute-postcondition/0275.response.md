Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` remains False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- Otherwise, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **String Slicing:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will slice the string from the beginning up to (but not including) index `j - 1`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will slice the string starting from index `j - 1` to the end.

3. **Index Calculation:**
   - `j - 1` is `2 - 1`, which is `1`.

4. **Slicing Results:**
   - `string[:1]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[1:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of the string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello", the output will be:
Output: **h ello**
