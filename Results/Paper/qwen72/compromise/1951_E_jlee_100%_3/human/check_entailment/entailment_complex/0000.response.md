Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to partition a given string into non-palindromic substrings. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement:

1. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string has only one character, it is a palindrome, and the function correctly prints "NO" and continues to the next test case.

2. **First and Last Character Different**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is non-palindromic, and the function correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and the string itself.

3. **All Characters the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, any substring will also be a palindrome. The function correctly prints "NO" and continues to the next test case.

4. **All but One Character the Same**:
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, the function checks if the string can be split into two non-palindromic substrings. It correctly handles this by checking if the middle character (in the case of an odd-length string) is different from the common character. If it is, the function prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and the string itself.

5. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`x`). It then continues to find the second character that is different from `x` to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings. The logic here is to ensure that the split results in non-palindromic parts:
     - If the first non-`x` character is found and the second non-`x` character is found, it prints the split.
     - If the first non-`x` character is found but the second non-`x` character is not found, it prints the split if the first non-`x` character is not at the end of the string.
     - If no valid split is found, it prints "NO".

The function correctly handles all the edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement. The logic is sound and the output is consistent with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
