Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, and `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\).
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.
- After this code, `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `k` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
