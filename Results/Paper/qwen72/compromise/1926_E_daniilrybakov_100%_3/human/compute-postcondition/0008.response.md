Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers and `n` must be non-zero, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `s < k` and `k <= s + x`.** 

In natural language: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers with `n` being non-zero. `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is updated to `n // 2`. Additionally, `k` is greater than `s` and less than or equal to `s + x`.
