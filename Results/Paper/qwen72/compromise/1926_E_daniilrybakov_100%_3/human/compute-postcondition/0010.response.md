Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers with `n` being non-zero, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now `n // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
