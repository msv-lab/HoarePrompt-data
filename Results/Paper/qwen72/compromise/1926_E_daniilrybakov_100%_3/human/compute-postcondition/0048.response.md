The variable in the loop head is `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero. According to the state provided, `n` is now `n // 2` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the division.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is now `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`**
