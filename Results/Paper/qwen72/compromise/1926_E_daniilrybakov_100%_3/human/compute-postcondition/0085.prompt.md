Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the user, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of the sequence of values `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the highest power of 2 that can be obtained by multiplying 2 by itself the number of times the loop executed without breaking, and `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of the values of `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the highest power of 2 that divides the initial `n` without remainder, `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
