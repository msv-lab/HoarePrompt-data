To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the sum of the values of `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
   - `m` is the highest power of 2 that divides the initial `n` without remainder.
   - `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `n` is initially 0, the expression `(n + 1) // 2` evaluates to `1 // 2`, which is 0.
   - The sum `s` is the sum of these values, but since `n` is 0 and does not change, `s` will be 0.
   - The highest power of 2 that divides 0 is not well-defined, but in the context of the problem, we can assume `m` is 1 (since 0 is not a valid input for this calculation and the problem likely assumes `n` is non-zero at some point).
   - `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, which is 0.

3. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `s` is 0.
     - `m` is 1.
   - The expression simplifies to:
     \[
     (2 * (k - 0) - 1) * 1 = (2 * k - 1) * 1 = 2 * k - 1
     \]

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
