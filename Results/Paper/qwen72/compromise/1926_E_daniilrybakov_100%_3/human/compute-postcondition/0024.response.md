Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2` and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer with `n` being greater than 1, `s` is now `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is the updated value of `n`). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
