The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be non-zero after the division.

Given that `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 before the division (since 4 // 4 = 1, which is the minimum value for `n` to be non-zero). Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
