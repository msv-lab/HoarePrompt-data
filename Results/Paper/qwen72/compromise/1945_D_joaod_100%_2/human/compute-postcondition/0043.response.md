The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at the index `v` of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The value of `v` is `na_frente - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`, and `best` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body if applicable.**
