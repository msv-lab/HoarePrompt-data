Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.***
