Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is the number of iterations the loop has run, `c` is `cases - 1`, `na_frente` is the last input integer minus 1, `pos_final` is the last input integer minus `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following state holds true:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain integers within the range 1 to 200,000, with `m` being less than or equal to `n`.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, containing integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The variable `cases` is the total number of iterations the loop has run.
- The variable `c` is `cases - 1`, indicating the last iteration index.
- The variable `na_frente` is the last input integer minus 1, reflecting the final value of the first integer from the input for the last iteration.
- The variable `pos_final` is the last input integer minus `cases`, reflecting the final value of the second integer from the input for the last iteration.
- The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are the lists of integers provided by the user for the last iteration.
- The variable `v` is -1, as it is the final value after the inner loop completes.
- The variable `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
