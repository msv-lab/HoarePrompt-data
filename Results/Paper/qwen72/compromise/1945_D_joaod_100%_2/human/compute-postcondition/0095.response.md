The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `cases` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `cases` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
