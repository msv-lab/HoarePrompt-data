### Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is defined to store the balance, position, and character of each prefix in the input string. This is a good approach to keep track of the necessary information for sorting.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It first compares the `balance` attribute. If the balances are different, it returns the difference in balances. If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions in decreasing order (i.e., it sorts positions in descending order when balances are equal).
   - The logic is correct for the sorting criteria specified in the problem.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function initializes the length of the string `s` and an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
   - After the loop, the `balance` should be 0 because the input string is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The list `balance_info` is then sorted using the `func_1` function as the key. The sorting criteria are:
     - First by `balance` in ascending order.
     - Then by `position` in descending order for equal balances.
   - Finally, the sorted `balance_info` list is used to construct the result string by joining the characters in the order they appear after sorting.
   - The result is printed.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem:
  - It computes the balance for each prefix.
  - It sorts the characters based on the specified criteria.
  - It constructs and prints the balanced shuffle of the input string.
- The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
