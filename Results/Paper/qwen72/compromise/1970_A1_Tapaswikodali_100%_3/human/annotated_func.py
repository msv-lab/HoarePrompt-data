#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB`.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the character in the sequence for `infoB` and the position of the character in the sequence for `infoA`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with `balance` and `position` attributes. If the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are not equal, the function returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and the `balance` of `infoB`. If the `balance` attributes are equal, the function returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and the `position` of `infoA`. The function does not modify the `infoA` or `infoB` objects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character of the string `s` at that index. `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is constructed from the characters in `s` based on the sorted `balance_info`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and prints a rearranged version of the string `s` where the parentheses are sorted based on their balance and position. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the sorted string is printed to the console.
