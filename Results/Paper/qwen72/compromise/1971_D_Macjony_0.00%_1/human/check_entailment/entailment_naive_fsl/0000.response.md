Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the minimum number of pieces required for certain binary strings. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `10101`. According to the problem, the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange this string into a sorted binary string is 3. The correct pieces would be `10`, `10`, and `1`.

However, the program will output 4 for this input. Let's break down the execution:

- The initial count is set to 1.
- The loop iterates through the string:
  - At `j = 0`, `s[0] != s[1]` (1 != 0), so `count` becomes 2.
  - At `j = 1`, `s[1] != s[2]` (0 != 1), so `count` becomes 3.
  - At `j = 2`, `s[2] != s[3]` (1 != 0), so `count` becomes 4.
  - At `j = 3`, `s[3] != s[4]` (0 != 1), so `count` becomes 5.
- The flag is set to `True` because there is a transition from `0` to `1`.
- The final count is adjusted by subtracting 1 due to the flag, resulting in `count = 4`.

The correct output should be 3, but the program outputs 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
