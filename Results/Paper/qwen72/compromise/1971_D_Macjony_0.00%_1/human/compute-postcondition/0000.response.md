The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the user input. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).**
