Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is 1 (or 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1'), `count` is 1 (or 2 if the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` is True (if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False). If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `count` is 2 (or 3 if the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`).***
