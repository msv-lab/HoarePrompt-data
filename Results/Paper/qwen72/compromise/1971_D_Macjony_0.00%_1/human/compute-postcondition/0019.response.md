Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `count` is 2 if the first character of `s` is equal to the second character of `s`, otherwise `count` is 3, `flag` is True if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, `j` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1' and `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `j` is 1.***
