Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is the length of the string `s` minus 1. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `count` and `flag` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different plus 1, and `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`. If `flag` is True, the postconditions remain as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
