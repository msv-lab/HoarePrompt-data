Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to index 2 (inclusive), and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so `i` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
