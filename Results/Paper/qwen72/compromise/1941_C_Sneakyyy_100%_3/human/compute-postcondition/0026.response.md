To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by counting the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - This means `ans` will be an integer representing how many times either 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`.

3. **Understanding `i`:**
   - `i` is the length of `a` minus 2, which is used to ensure that the substrings are checked up to the second-to-last character of `a`.

4. **Execution of the `print` statement:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the `print` statement will output the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the input string a)**
