Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string with `len(a)` greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is increased by 3 and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` remains unchanged.***
