Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is 0, `i` is the length of the previous `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring in the previous `a`.**

The value of `ans` is reset to 0, while the values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
