Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive). If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `s` from the updated index `i` (which is 4) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3.***
