Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string with `len(a)` greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was initially 1, `ans` remains 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
