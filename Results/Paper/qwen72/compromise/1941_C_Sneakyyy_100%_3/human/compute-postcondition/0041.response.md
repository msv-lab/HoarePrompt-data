Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string with `len(a)` greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged.
- `s` is now assigned the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at `i + 3`.
- The conditions for `ans` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, but `s` is now the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.
