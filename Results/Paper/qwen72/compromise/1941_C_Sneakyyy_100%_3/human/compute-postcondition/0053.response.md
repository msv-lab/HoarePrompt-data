To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`.
   - `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n` is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `a` is the string in which we are searching for the substrings 'map' and 'pie'.
   - `ans` is the count of how many times either 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`.
   - `i` is not directly used in the `print` statement.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the count of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string a)**
