Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains the input string, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: This variable counts the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' are found in `a`. Each time one of these substrings is found, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- **`i`**: This variable is used to iterate through the string `a`. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 3 each time a 'map' or 'pie' is found, or by 1 if neither is found. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`, meaning `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2` or greater when the loop ends. If `i` is exactly `len(a) - 2` at the end, it will be incremented by 1 in the last iteration, making it `len(a) - 1`. Thus, the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, depending on the last increment.
