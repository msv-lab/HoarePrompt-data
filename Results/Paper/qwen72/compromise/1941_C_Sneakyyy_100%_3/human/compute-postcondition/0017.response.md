Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive). If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4, otherwise `len(a)` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 2.**
