Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the removal of characters to make the string beautiful.

1. **Incorrect Increment of `i`:**
   - The program increments `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie". This means it skips the next two characters without checking if they form another "map" or "pie" substring. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will only remove one "map" and then skip the next two characters, leaving "pppie" which is still ugly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Deletions:**
   - The program increments `ans` by 1 for each "map" or "pie" substring found. However, the correct approach should be to count the number of characters that need to be deleted to remove the entire substring. For example, to remove "map" or "pie", you need to delete 3 characters, not 1.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Identify all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- For each occurrence, determine the minimum number of characters to delete to remove the substring.
- Sum up the minimum deletions required for all occurrences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                ans += 3  # Delete all 3 characters of the substring
                i += 3  # Move past the deleted substring
            else:
                i += 1  # Move to the next character
        print(ans)
```

This version correctly increments `ans` by 3 for each "map" or "pie" substring found and moves the index `i` past the deleted substring. This ensures that all occurrences of the substrings are handled correctly.
