Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is an array of positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max` is the maximum of the second largest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
