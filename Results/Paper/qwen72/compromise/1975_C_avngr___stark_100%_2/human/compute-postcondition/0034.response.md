To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 3. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is incremented by 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-3` (this is not relevant to the loop head, as `i` will be reinitialized by the loop)

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` will start at 0 and will be incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0**
