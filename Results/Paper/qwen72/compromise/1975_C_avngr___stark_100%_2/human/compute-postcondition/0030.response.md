Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `n-3`.
   - `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(min(a))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(min(a))` statement will print the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is provided by the user, and its elements are integers.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `max` are not directly relevant to the `print(min(a))` statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list `a`)**
