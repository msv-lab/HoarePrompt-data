The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `_` is a placeholder variable that increments by 1 with each iteration.

Given that `_` is a placeholder variable, it does not have a specific value that we need to track beyond knowing that it increments. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.**
