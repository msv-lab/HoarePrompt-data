Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, `max` is updated based on the second element of the sorted `temp`**

Explanation:
- The `temp.sort()` method sorts the list `temp` in ascending order.
- The elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` are now sorted within `temp`.
- The value of `max` is updated to the second element of the sorted `temp` list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
