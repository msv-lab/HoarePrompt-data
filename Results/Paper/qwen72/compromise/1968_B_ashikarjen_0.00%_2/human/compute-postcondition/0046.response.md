Postcondition: ***`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` or `j == m`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
