Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m - 1`, `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `j` must be less than `m - 1` is still valid.
- The condition that `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]` is still valid.
