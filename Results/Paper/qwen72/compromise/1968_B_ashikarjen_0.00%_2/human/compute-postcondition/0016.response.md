Postcondition: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `k` is 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` or `j == m`, and `b[0]` to `b[j-1]` must all be different from `a[i]`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `m`.**
