Postcondition: ***`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `k` is 0 or 1, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m`. If `j < m`, `k` is 1. If `j >= m`, `k` is 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `m`.***
