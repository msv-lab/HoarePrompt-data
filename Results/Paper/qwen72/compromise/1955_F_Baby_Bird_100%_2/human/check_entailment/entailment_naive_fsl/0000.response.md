Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.

The core logic of the program is:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
3. It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum (3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + (x \mod 2) \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
   \]
   where \( x \) is the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and \( i \) is the index of the number (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).

This formula works because:
- Each pair of the same number (1, 2, 3, or 4) can be removed without changing the XOR result.
- If there is an odd count of a number, removing one of them can potentially change the XOR result to zero, which is a win for Bob.
- The formula ensures that the maximum number of such pairs and odd counts are considered to maximize Bob's wins.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
