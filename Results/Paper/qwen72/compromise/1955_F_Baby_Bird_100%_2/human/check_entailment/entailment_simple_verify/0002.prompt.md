You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each test case contains four integers p_i such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: [result of sum calculation divided by 3 for each test case] (where each test case contains four integers \(p_i\) such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game continues as Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.
   - Removing a number from the sequence can change the XOR result.
   - The optimal strategy for Eve is to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be paired off.
   - Specifically, the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if the count of each number modulo 2 is zero.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero by removing numbers that balance the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

4. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The given program uses a formula to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - The formula is: `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`
   - Let's break it down:
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of each type of number.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when the count of each type of number is divided by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` accounts for the pairs, and each pair can contribute to making the XOR zero.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` accounts for the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s (but not 4s, since `i < 3` is false for `i = 3`).
     - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `1 1 1 0`
     - Pairs: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - For the second test case: `1 0 1 2`
     - Pairs: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `1` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `0` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (0 + 0 + 0 + 1) + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`
     - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - For the third test case: `2 2 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`
     - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - For the fourth test case: `3 3 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 10`
     - Result: `10 // 3 = 3`
   - For the fifth test case: `0 9 9 9`
     - Pairs: `4` (1s), `4` (2s), `4` (3s), `4` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `1` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (4 + 4 + 4 + 4) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48 + 4 = 52`
     - Result: `52 // 3 = 17`

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
   - The formula used in the program is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
