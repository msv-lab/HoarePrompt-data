Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the closest city is not unique. The problem description explicitly states that the cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. However, the program does not enforce this constraint, and it could lead to incorrect results if the input violates this assumption. For example, if the cities are located at points [1, 2, 3], the program would not correctly handle the queries because the city at point 2 has two closest cities (1 and 3), both having a distance of 1. This violates the problem's constraint, and the program does not check for this condition, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
