Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated to the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
