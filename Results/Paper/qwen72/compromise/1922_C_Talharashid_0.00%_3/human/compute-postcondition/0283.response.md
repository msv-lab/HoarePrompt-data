Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[1]` is `s + 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[1] - lst[0]), mini)` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
