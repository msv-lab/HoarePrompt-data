Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `d1` contains the cumulative sum of `s` at each step of the loop, `inc` is -1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111` and the absolute difference between `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start]`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. `d2[start]` is now `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. `s` is the minimum value between `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `d2[start]` is now `s`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to include `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `d2[start]` is set to `s`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. `d2[start]` is now `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 5`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` and `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 5])`, `s` is the minimum value between 11111111 and `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` incremented by 1 or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 5])` depending on the value of `mini`, `d2[len(lst) - 4]` is `s`, and `d2[start]` is now `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
