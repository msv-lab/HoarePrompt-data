Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1; otherwise, `mini` remains 11111011, `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is `s`.**

Explanation:
- `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.
- `s` is updated based on the condition involving `mini` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.
- `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1; otherwise, it remains 11111011.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`) retain their initial values.
