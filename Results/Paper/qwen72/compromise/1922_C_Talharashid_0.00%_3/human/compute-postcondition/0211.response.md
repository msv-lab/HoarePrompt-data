Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `d2[start]` is `s`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, or between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Since `inc` is -1, this means `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.
- The conditions for updating `mini` and `s` based on `start - 1` and `start + 1` are still valid and remain unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain the same.
