Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)` updates the value of `mini`.
- `start` is 2, so `lst[start]` is `lst[2]` and `lst[start - 1]` is `lst[1]`.
- The new value of `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[1])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
