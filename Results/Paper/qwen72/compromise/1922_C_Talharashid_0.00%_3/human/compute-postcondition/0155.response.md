Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` remains unchanged, `d1[start]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its previous value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
