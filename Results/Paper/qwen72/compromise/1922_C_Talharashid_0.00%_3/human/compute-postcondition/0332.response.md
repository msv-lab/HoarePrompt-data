Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d2[start + 1]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of the current value of `mini` (which is 11111111) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The value of `mini` is now the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.
