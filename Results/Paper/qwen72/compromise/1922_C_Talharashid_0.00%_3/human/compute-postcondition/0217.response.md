The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `start` being `0` and the other variables (`s`, `d2`, `t`, `d1`, `n`, and `lst`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
