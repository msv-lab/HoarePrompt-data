Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` must be greater than `m`. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
