Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0.** 

The variable `s` is now initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
