The loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` so that they are not equal. At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `end` is 0. Since `start` must be greater than 0 and `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `start` should not be equal to `end`.

Given that `inc` is -1, `start` will be decremented in the loop body. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `start` is not yet equal to `end` after this adjustment. Since `end` is 0, `start` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `start` is greater than 0 and not equal to `end`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111` and the absolute difference between `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start]`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. `d2[start]` is now `s`.**
