Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `start` and `end` (whether `start` is less than, greater than, or equal to `end`) are still valid, but the specific values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the values of `d1` and `d2`, which are not provided. Therefore, only `s1` is updated in the output state.
