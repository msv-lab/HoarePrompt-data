Postcondition: ***`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is increased by 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. If `start - 1 <= -1`, `mini` remains unchanged.***
