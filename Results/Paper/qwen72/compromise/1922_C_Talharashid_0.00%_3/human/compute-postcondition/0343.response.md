To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. The state before the loop starts indicates that the loop has completed all iterations, so `i` is currently `m`. For the loop to start again, `i` needs to be reset to 0, and `m` needs to be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
