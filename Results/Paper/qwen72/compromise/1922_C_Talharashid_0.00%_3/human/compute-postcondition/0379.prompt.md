Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries, and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    inc = 1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d1[start] = s
    start = len(lst) - 1
    end = 0
    inc = -1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d2[start] = s
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        start, end = map(int, input().split())
        start -= 1
        end -= 1
        s = 0
        if start < end:
            s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
            s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
        else:
            s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
            s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
        print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the first integer from the last user input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the last user input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is an input integer. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` ≥ `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the input integer, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is 0. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
