Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start + 1]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start + 1]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end - 1]` and `d2[start - 2]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `end` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`, `start`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `s1` and `s2` are still valid but now depend on the updated value of `end`.
