Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`, and `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d2[start + 1]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 2])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `start + 1 - 1` is greater than -1, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. If `start + 1 - 1` is not greater than -1, `s` remains unchanged. In all cases, `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 5`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d2[start + 1]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111001, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111001.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
