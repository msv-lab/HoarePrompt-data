Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the variable `mini` which is set to the value 11111111.
