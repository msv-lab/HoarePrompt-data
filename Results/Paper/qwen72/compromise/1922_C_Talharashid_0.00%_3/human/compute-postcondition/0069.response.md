Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `s` is the minimum value between `11111111` and `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])`. `d2[start]` is now `s`.**
