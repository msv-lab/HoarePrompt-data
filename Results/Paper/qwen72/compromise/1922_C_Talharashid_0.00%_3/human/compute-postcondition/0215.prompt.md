Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `d1[start]` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, `inc` is -1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1; otherwise, `mini` remains 11111011, `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `d2[start]` is `s`. If `mini` was equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 + inc])`, then `s` is increased by 1. If `start + 1 - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start + 1 + inc]`. If `start + 1 - 1 <= -1`, `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 5`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `s` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
