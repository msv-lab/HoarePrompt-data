Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1[start]` is now `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d1[start] = s` updates the value of `d1[start]` to `s`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific value of `s` is not provided, but it is updated based on the conditions described in the initial state. The initial state information that remains valid is included in the output state.
