Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1` or the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111 if `start - 1 <= -1`, `s` is the minimum value between 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and is incremented by 1, `d2[start]` is now `s`.**
