Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `cnt_aa` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the specific integers provided by the user, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 1, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `cnt_aa` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are updated to the specific integers provided by the user, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 1, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `fnd` is 1 if `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` is 0. If `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, `fnd` is incremented by 1. `in_aa` is the element at index `m` of `aa`, `out_aa` is the element at index `0` of `aa`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then the frequency of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1, and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then the frequency of `in_aa` in `D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` remains greater than 0. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, the frequency of `in_aa` in `E` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `cnt_aa` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are updated to the specific integers provided by the user, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 1, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `fnd` is 1 if `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` is 2, `in_aa` is the element at index `m + 1` of `aa`, `out_aa` is the element at index `1` of `aa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `cnt_aa` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are updated to the specific integers provided by the user, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 1, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `fnd` is 2 if `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` is 1, `in_aa` is the element at index `m + 2` of `aa`, `out_aa` is the element at index `2` of `aa`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
