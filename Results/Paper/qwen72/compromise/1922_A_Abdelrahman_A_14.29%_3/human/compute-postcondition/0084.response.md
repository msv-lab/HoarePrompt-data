Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
