The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `tests`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the literal string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
