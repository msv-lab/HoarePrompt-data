Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, and all characters in `c` are found in `a` or `b`, then `no` is True. Otherwise, `no` is False.***
