Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least three characters, `x` is the third character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `no` remains unchanged.***
