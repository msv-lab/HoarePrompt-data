Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` has been fully iterated, and `no` is False if any character in `c` is not found in `a` or `b`, otherwise `no` remains True.***
