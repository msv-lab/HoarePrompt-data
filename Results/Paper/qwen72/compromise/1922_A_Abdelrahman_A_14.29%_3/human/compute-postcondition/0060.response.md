Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`, `no` is False. If all characters in `c` are in `a` or `b`, `no` remains True. If `no` is True, the current value of `no` remains True.***
