You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right and represent the bounds of a subarray in arr. clique is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to elements in the subarray.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: The subarray `arr[left:left + mid]` is filled with values starting from `small_element` and increasing by 1 for each subsequent element. The subarray `cliquess[left:left + mid]` is filled with the value `clique`. The values of `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The subarray `arr[left:left + mid]` is filled with values starting from `small_element` and increasing by 1 for each subsequent element. The subarray `arr[left + mid:left + mid + not_mid]` is filled with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent element. The subarray `cliquess[left:left + mid]` is filled with the value `clique`. The subarray `cliquess[left + mid:left + mid + not_mid]` is also filled with the value `clique`. The values of `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It returns an array where each element in the subarray from index `left` to index `right` (inclusive) is assigned the value `clique`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
