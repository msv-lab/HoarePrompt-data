Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is `cases - 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final` for each test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `cases` is the total number of test cases, which is an input integer greater than 0.
- The variable `c` is now `cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `cases` times.
- For each test case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the first and second integers input by the user, respectively, each decremented by 1.
- The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are the lists of integers input by the user for each test case.
- The variable `v` is -1, indicating that the inner loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `best` is the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final` for each test case. This value is printed for each test case after the inner loop completes.
