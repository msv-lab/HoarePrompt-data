Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all iterations where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The code `na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` based on user input.
- `na_frente` is now the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0.
- `pos_final` is now the second integer input by the user minus 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `c`, `v`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best`) remain unchanged.
