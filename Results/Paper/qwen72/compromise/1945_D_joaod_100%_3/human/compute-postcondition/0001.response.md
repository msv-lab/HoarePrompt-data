The only objects in the loop head are `c` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `cases` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
