### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill starts at the end of the queue (position `n+1`).
   - He can bribe people to move to any position `j` where `j < i` (his current position).
   - The cost to move to position `j` is `a_j` plus `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.
   - Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
   - We need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
     - It reads the `a` and `b` lists, reverses them, and initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
     - It iterates over the first `n - k` positions (from the end of the queue) to calculate the cost of moving to these positions.
     - If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, it adds the current `soma_b` and `a[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - After this loop, it initializes `resultado` to infinity and iterates over the remaining positions to find the minimum cost.
     - It updates `resultado` with the minimum cost and adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases.
     - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each one.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Reversing the Lists:**
     - Reversing the lists is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the positions from the end of the queue to the front, which is necessary for calculating the minimum cost.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - The program correctly calculates the cost of moving to each position by considering the `a` and `b` values.
     - The `soma_b` variable keeps track of the cumulative cost of `b` values for positions that Kirill has not yet moved past.
     - The `pref` variable accumulates the cost of moving to positions where `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`.
   - **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
     - The program correctly finds the minimum cost by iterating over the remaining positions and updating `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already in the first `m` positions):**
     - If `m == n`, Kirill is already in the first `m` positions, and the program should output 0. The current implementation does this correctly because the loop `for i in range(n - k)` will not run if `n - k == 0`, and the minimum cost will be 0.
   - **Case where `m` is 1 (Kirill wants to be at the very front of the queue):**
     - If `m == 1`, Kirill needs to move to the front of the queue. The program correctly calculates the cost to move to the front by considering all `a` and `b` values.
   - **Case where all `a` values are greater than `b` values and vice versa:**
     - The program correctly handles these cases by using the `soma_b` and `pref` variables to accumulate the costs.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the cost calculation and minimum cost determination are done correctly. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

Final: **True**
