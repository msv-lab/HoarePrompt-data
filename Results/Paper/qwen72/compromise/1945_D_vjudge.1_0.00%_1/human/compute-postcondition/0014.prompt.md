You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n, where each element a_i and b_i satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged. `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `k` to `n-1` that are not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A`. `pref` is the sum of `soma_b` and the elements in `lista_A` from index `0` to `n-k-1` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `k` to `n-1`, `pref` is the sum of `soma_b` and the elements in `lista_A` from index `0` to `n-k-1` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` in the range from `n-k` to `n-1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + lista_A[i] for i in the range from n-k to n-1, and pref is the sum of soma_b and the elements in lista_A from index 0 to n-k-1 that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, and soma_b is the sum of elements in lista_B from index k to n-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
