The code snippet `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` creates a list `nums` where each element is `1` shifted left by `i` bits, for `i` ranging from 0 to 23. This results in a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23.**
