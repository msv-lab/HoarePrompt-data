Let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the list `nums` step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23. This means `nums` initially contains the values: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).

2. **Finding `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\).
   - This means \(2^{\text{idx}} - 1\) is the smallest power of 2 minus 1 that is greater than `k`.
   - For example, if \(k = 10\), then \(2^4 - 1 = 15\) is the smallest power of 2 minus 1 that is greater than 10, so `idx` would be 4.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - `nums` now includes an additional element at the end which is `k - nums[idx]`.
   - `nums` now includes another additional element at the end which is `k + 1`.
   - `nums` now includes a third additional element at the end which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume \(k = 10\).
   - Then, \(2^4 - 1 = 15\) is the smallest power of 2 minus 1 that is greater than 10, so `idx` is 4.
   - The element \(2^4 = 16\) is removed from `nums`.
   - The new elements added to `nums` are:
     - \(k - nums[idx] = 10 - 16 = -6\)
     - \(k + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\)
     - \(k + nums[idx] + 1 = 10 + 16 + 1 = 27\)
   - The final `nums` list will be: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -6, 11, 27]\).

5. **General Case**:
   - For any given `k`, `idx` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} - 1 > k\).
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) will be removed from `nums`.
   - The new elements added to `nums` will be:
     - \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\)

6. **Output**:
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the modified `nums` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2^idx, k + 1, k + 2^idx + 1 (where idx is the smallest integer such that k < 2^idx - 1)**

This output format ensures that the values of the variables and the structure of the list are clearly described.
