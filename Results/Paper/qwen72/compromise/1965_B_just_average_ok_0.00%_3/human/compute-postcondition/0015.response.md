Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list `nums`.
- The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- After removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the list `nums` no longer contains this element.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
