Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. `_` is 0.
4. `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0.
5. `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed.
6. The last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
7. `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `nums` Construction:**
   - The list `nums` contains \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, which means it initially has 24 elements: \([2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).
   - One element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from this list.
   - Therefore, `nums` will have \(24 - 1 = 23\) elements.

2. **Last Element of `nums`:**
   - The last element of `nums` is modified to be `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Since `nums[idx]` is the element that was removed, it is no longer in the list, but its value is still known and used in the last element calculation.
   - This does not affect the length of the list, as it only modifies the last element.

3. **Length of `nums`:**
   - The length of `nums` is determined by the number of elements in the list.
   - As we established, `nums` has 23 elements after removing one element.

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`, which is 23.

Output: **23**
