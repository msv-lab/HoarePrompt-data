The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), which means the maximum value of `1 << idx` can be \(2^{23}\) (when `idx` is 23).

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(2^1\) (which is 2) since `idx` is 1. However, to ensure the loop can proceed to the next iteration, `idx` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to \(2^2\) (which is 4).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `idx` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4**
