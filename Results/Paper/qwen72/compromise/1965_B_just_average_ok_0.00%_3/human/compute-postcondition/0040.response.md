To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `while k >= 1 << idx`.

1. **Variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `k` and `idx`.
2. **Initial values**:
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0.

3. **Condition evaluation**:
   - The loop condition `k >= 1 << idx` needs to be true for the loop to execute.
   - When `idx` is 0, `1 << idx` is `1 << 0`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `k >= 1` must be true.

4. **Current state**:
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0, which means `k >= 1` is already true.

Since `k` is already greater than 0, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` (which simplifies to `k >= 1` when `idx` is 0) is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0**
