Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.** 

The loop iterates `t` times, and within each iteration, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are redefined based on the input provided. The result of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is printed, but this does not affect the value of `t` or any other variables outside the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, the value of `t` is still the same as it was initially, and no other variables are modified.
