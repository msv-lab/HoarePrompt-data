The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since `t` is already given as an integer between 1 and 50000, inclusive, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50000, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder**
