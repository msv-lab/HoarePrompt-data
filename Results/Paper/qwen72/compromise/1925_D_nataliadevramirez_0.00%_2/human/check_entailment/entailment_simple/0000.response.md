### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in k excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The final answer should be expressed as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
     - It initializes `result` to 0.
     - It iterates over each friendship pair, and for each pair, it adds the product of the friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (i.e., \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \)) to `result`.
     - The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - This function assumes that each pair of friends is chosen with equal probability and that the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

3. **Correctness of the Calculation:**
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which is correct.
   - The program multiplies each friendship value `f` by this sum, which is the expected increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions if the pair is chosen.
   - However, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. Since the pairs are chosen equiprobably and independently, the expected value for each pair being chosen in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each pair being chosen in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected value for each pair being chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The total expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair, which is \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The program should calculate \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) and then take the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program needs to calculate the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The modular inverse can be calculated using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem if \( 10^9 + 7 \) is a prime number.

6. **Program Flaws:**
   - The program does not calculate the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \).
   - The program does not divide the result by \( \binom{n}{2} \) to get the expected value.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It needs to account for the probability of each pair being chosen and use the modular inverse to correctly compute the expected value.
