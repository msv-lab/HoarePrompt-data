Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2n` elements: the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the next `n` elements are `a + c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, appending one new element to the list `li` in each iteration.
- Initially, `li` contains `n` elements: `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- In each iteration of the loop, the element `a + c + d * h` is appended to `li`, where `h` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
- After all `n` iterations, `li` will contain `2n` elements: the first `n` elements are the same as initially, and the next `n` elements are the results of the loop iterations.
