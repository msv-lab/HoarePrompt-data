Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+3` elements: `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and the last three elements are `a + c + d`, `a + c + d`, and `a + k * c + d * h` where `k` is 1 and `h` is 2, `k` is 1, `h` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
