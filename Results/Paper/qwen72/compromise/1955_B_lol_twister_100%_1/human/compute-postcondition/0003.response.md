To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for h in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `h` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(0, n)` generates a sequence of values. This means `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
   - `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6.
   - `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - `li` is an empty list.
   - `k` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The only variable that affects the loop execution is `n`.
   - Since `n` is already given as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **Initial Value of `h`:**
   - The variable `h` will start at 0, as specified by `range(0, n)`.

### Final State:
Since `n` is already within the required range (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and `h` will start at 0, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `h` is 0**
