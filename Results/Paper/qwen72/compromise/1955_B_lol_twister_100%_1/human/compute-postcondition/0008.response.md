The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is 0 and `h` is 2. Given the initial state, the value of `k` is 0 and `h` is 2, so the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 2`, which further simplifies to `a + 2 * d`.

Therefore, the new element being appended to `li` is `a + 2 * d`. The list `li` initially contains two elements: `a + k * c + d * h` (which simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 2` or `a + 2 * d`) and `a + 0 * c + d * 1` (which simplifies to `a + d`). After appending the new element, `li` will contain three elements: `a + 2 * d`, `a + d`, and `a + 2 * d`.

The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing three elements: `a + 2 * d`, `a + d`, and `a + 2 * d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
