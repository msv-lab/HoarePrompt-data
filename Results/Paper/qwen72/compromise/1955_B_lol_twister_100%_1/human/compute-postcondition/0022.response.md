The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is 1, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c + d * 1`, which is `a + k * c + d`.

Therefore, the new element added to `li` is `a + k * c + d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 1, `li` contains the elements `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d`.**
