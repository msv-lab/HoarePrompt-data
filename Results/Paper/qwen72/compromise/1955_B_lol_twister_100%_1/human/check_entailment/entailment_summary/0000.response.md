Reasoning:  
The program aims to verify if the elements in the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The approach taken by the program is to generate the expected values of the progressive square using the minimum value in `l` and the parameters `c` and `d`. It then compares the sorted version of the generated list with the sorted version of the input list `l`.

1. **Finding the Minimum Value**: The program correctly identifies the minimum value in the list `l` which is used as the base value `a` for constructing the progressive square.
2. **Generating the Progressive Square Values**: The nested loops correctly generate the values for the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
3. **Sorting and Comparing**: Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted before comparison. This ensures that the order of elements does not affect the result.
4. **Output**: The function returns 'yes' if the sorted lists match, indicating that the input list can form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly implements the logic to check if the input list can form the required progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
