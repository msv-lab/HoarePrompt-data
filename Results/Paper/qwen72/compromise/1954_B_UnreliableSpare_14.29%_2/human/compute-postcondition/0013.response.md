Postcondition: **The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array. Additionally, `flag` is False.**
