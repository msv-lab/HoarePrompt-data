The function `func_1` is intended to accept a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as parameters. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should process a list `a` that is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function should accept a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n`. It processes the list to determine if it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation and returns the result.**
