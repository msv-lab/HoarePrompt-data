Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as parameters. Additionally, the function is part of a solution that processes multiple test cases, so it should also take the number of test cases `t` as an input, though this is typically handled in the outer loop of the program rather than being passed to the function for each test case. The array `a` is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
