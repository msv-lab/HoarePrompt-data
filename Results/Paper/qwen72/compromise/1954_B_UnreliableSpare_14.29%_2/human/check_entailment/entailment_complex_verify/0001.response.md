### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and calls the function `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
     - It initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
     - If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals:**
     - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and a tuple `(val, cnt)` to `(arr[0], 0)`.
     - It iterates through the array again, counting the occurrences of the first element `val`.
     - If it encounters an element different from `val`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
     - After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time.
   - **Output:**
     - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - **All Elements the Same:**
     - If all elements in the array are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. Hence, the output `-1` is correct.
   - **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals:**
     - The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
     - It does this by counting the occurrences of the first element `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements.
     - However, this logic is flawed because it only considers the first element and does not account for other elements or the structure of the array.
     - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the occurrences of `1` and set `ans` to `3` (the count of `1`), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the last `1` makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
     - The program should consider the structure of the array and the positions of elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

4. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.
   - It only considers the first element and does not account for the structure of the array, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
   - The correct approach should involve identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent any sequence of operations from making all elements the same.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the condition where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. It only considers the first element and does not account for the structure of the array, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
