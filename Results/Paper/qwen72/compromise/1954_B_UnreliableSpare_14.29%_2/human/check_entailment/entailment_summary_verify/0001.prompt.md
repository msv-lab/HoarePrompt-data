You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. If they are not, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this count. The function does not modify the input `n` or `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
     - It initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
     - If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals:**
     - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and a tuple `(val, cnt)` to `(arr[0], 0)`.
     - It iterates through the array again, counting the occurrences of the first element `val`.
     - If it encounters an element different from `val`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
     - After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time.
   - **Output:**
     - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - **All Elements the Same:**
     - If all elements in the array are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. Hence, the output `-1` is correct.
   - **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals:**
     - The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
     - It does this by counting the occurrences of the first element `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements.
     - However, this logic is flawed because it only considers the first element and does not account for other elements or the structure of the array.

4. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the occurrences of `1` and set `ans` to `3` (the count of `1`), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the last `1` makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
   - The program should consider the structure of the array and the positions of elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the condition where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. It only considers the first element and does not account for the structure of the array, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
