The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the input integer provided to `range()`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the input integer. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and the input integer must be greater than 1.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, no additional changes are made. If `k` is odd, no additional changes are made. If `k` is even and not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{p - 1}\), and `f` is 0. The input integer provided to `range()` must be greater than 1.**
