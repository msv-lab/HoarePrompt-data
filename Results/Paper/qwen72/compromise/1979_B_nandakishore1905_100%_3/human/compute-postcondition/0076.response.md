Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2 plus \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^p\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = len(l)` updates the value of `p` to be the length of the string `l`.
- `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, so `p` is now the length of this binary string.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
