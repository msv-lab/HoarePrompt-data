The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers, and they must satisfy the condition 0 <= x, y <= 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9. The function's return value is not specified.**
