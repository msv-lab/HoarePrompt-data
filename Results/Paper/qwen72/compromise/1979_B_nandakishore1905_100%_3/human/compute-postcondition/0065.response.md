Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` remain distinct non-negative integers within the specified range.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `l` is now the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. For example, if `k` is 6, `l` would be '110'.
