Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, `f` is `k - q`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `f` is calculated as `k - q`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
