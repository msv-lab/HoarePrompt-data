Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated by converting `k` to its binary representation using `bin(k)`, and then removing the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `k` is still the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `l` now holds the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
