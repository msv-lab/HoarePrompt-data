The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer (i.e., `x` > 0). The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0. The state of `y` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 9, `i` is 0**
