Reasoning:  
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Function Name and Invocation**: The function is named `func` but is not invoked. The problem description suggests that the function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, but this is not done in the provided program. The function should be called after reading the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Variable Naming Conflict**: The variable `x` is used both as the number of test cases and as one of the integers to be compared. This is a naming conflict and can lead to confusion. It would be better to use a different variable name for the number of test cases.

3. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop control variable `i` is not used within the loop, which is fine, but it is not necessary to include it if it is not being used.

4. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `x` and then uses `x` to control the loop. However, the problem description states that the number of test cases should be read into a variable `t` and the loop should iterate `t` times.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the program structure needs to be adjusted to match the problem description.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not follow the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **False**
