The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `ap`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ap`. If `ap` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `x` and `y` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `k` should be 0, and `ap` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `k` is 0, `ap` must be greater than 0**
