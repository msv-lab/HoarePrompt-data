It seems there is a mismatch between the function definition provided and the problem description. The function should take parameters `x` and `y` to solve the problem described. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def min_screens(x, y):
```

Precondition: **x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
