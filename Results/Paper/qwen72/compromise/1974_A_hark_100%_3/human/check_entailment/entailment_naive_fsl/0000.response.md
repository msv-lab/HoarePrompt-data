Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This line attempts to adjust the count of 1x1 icons by subtracting the number of 1x1 icons that could be placed in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, but it incorrectly adds `y * 4` to the result, which is not necessary.

A correct approach would be to calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_space = (5 * 3) * screens_for_2x2 - (y * 4)
        remaining_1x1 = max(0, x - remaining_space)
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)
```

However, the original program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`:

- The program calculates `bxsfory` as `1` (since `y = 1` and `1 / 2 = 0.5`, which is rounded up to `1`).
- It then calculates `x` as `15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 4`.
- This results in `bxsfory1` being `1` (since `4 / 15` is `0.2667`, which is rounded up to `1`).
- The total number of screens is `1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the correct answer should be `1` because the 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icon. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
