### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates `ap` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Logic for Calculating Screens**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
     - It then calculates the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons by subtracting the space occupied by 2x2 icons from the total space. The formula used is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - The remaining 1x1 icons are then divided by the total number of cells in a screen (15) to find the additional screens needed.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program correctly prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The program correctly prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program correctly prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, or both are 0, correctly.
   - The program also handles the general case where both `x` and `y` are positive, and the calculation for the number of screens needed is correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct number of screens for each test case, as verified by the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons in each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
