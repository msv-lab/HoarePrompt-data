Output State: **The `lst` defaultdict contains the adjacency lists for the nodes in the tree, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its children. The `rev` defaultdict contains the reverse adjacency lists for the nodes in the tree, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its parent nodes. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, and `tmp` is equal to `z`. `one` is now `True`.**
