Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**:
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit is \( n \times a \).

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated as the sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time. The formula used is \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - (b - a + 1) \) buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit for the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns is calculated as the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time. The formula used is \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \). The profit for the remaining buns is \( a \times (n - (b - a + 1)) \).

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
