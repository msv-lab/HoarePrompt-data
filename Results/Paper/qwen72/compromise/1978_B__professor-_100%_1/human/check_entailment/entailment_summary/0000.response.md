Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b` for each one. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, the function prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, the function prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. This is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`. This is correct because Bob can sell all buns at the modified price, and the profit will be the sum of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-(n-1)`.
   - **Case 3**: If `b - a < n`, the function prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-(b-a)` plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`. This is correct because Bob can only sell `b - a` buns at the modified price before the price drops below the usual price `a`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `b` is less than or equal to `a` by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - The function also handles the edge case where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` by calculating the sum of the arithmetic sequence.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `b - a` is less than `n` by combining the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.

5. **Performance**:
   - The function uses arithmetic operations and simple conditions, which are efficient and should handle the constraints (`1 \le t \le 10^4`, `1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9`) without performance issues.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
