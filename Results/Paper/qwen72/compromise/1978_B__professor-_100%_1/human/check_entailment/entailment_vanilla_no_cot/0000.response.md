Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in the third condition. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **If `b <= a`**:
   - This condition correctly handles the case where the promotional price is less than or equal to the usual price. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price, which is `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`**:
   - This condition correctly handles the case where the difference between the promotional price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price, which is the sum of the first `n` integers starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. The formula used is correct: \((2b - n + 1) \cdot n // 2\).

3. **Else**:
   - This condition is intended to handle the case where the difference between the promotional price and the usual price is less than the number of buns. However, the formula used here is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     - Sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price, which is the sum of the first `b - a` integers starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time: \((b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1) // 2\).
     - Sell the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price: \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit should be the sum of these two parts.

The correct formula for the third condition should be:
\[ \text{profit} = \left( \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} \right) + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]

The program incorrectly combines these two parts in the formula:
\[ \text{profit} = \left( \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} \right) + a \cdot n \]

This results in an overestimation of the profit because it adds the usual price for all buns, instead of just the remaining buns.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1) // 2) + (n - k) * a))
```

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
