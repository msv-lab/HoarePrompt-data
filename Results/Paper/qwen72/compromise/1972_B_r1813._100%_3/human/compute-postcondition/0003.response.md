Output State: **The function still takes two parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins. The `input` variable is now set to the `sys.stdin.read` function. The `data` variable is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input read from `sys.stdin` and split by whitespace. `t` is now an integer equal to the first element of the `data` list converted to an integer. `index` is now 1.**
