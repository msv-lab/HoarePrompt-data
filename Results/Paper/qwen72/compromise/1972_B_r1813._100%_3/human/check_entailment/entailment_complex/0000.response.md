Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by determining the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins. The logic of the program is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win. This is because, with each move, the number of 'U' coins is reduced by one, and the two adjacent coins are flipped. If the number of 'U' coins is odd at the start, Alice will always have the last move, and if it is even, Bob will have the last move. The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in each test case and printing 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even.

However, there is a minor issue with the program: it does not handle the case where there are no 'U' coins at the beginning (i.e., the string `s` contains only 'D' characters). According to the problem statement, if there are no facing-up coins, the player loses. Since Alice goes first, if there are no 'U' coins, Alice will lose, and the program should print 'NO'. The current program will print 'NO' in this case, which is correct, but the reasoning should be explicitly stated.

Additionally, the program assumes that the input is read in a single line, which is not a standard way to handle input in competitive programming. Typically, each input is read in a separate line using `input()` or `sys.stdin.readline()`. However, since the problem description and the state comments indicate that the input is read in a single line and split, this is not an issue in the context of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of its logic and output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
