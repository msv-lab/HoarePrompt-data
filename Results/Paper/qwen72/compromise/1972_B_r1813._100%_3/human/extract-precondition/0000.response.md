Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(n, s):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**
