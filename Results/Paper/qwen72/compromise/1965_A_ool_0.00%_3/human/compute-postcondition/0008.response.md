Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is True.** 

Explanation: The loop iterates through the sorted unique elements in `set_` and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop. If no such difference is found, `not_c` remains True. The value of `A` toggles with each iteration, but since the loop starts with `A` as False and toggles `A` in each iteration, `A` will be True if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. Given that the first element of `arr` is 1, and the elements in `set_` are unique and sorted, the loop will only break if there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `set_`. If `set_` has no such gaps, `not_c` remains True, and `A` will be True after the loop completes.
