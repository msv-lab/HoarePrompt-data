### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It starts by assuming `A` (Alice) is the initial player who will win (`A = False`).
   - If the smallest pile is not 1, it immediately returns "Alice" because Alice can always choose a `k` that is the smallest pile size and win in one move.
   - It then creates a sorted set of the pile sizes to check the differences between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between any two consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each unique pile size.
   - If all pile sizes are consecutive (i.e., `not_c` is `True`), it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of the function is based on the observation that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile.
   - If the smallest pile is 1, the game becomes more complex. The key idea is to check if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are, the game can be reduced to a simpler form where the number of unique pile sizes determines the winner.
   - The toggling of `A` for each unique pile size is correct because each unique pile size represents a turn where the player can force the opponent into a losing position.
   - The final toggle of `A` if all pile sizes are consecutive is necessary to account for the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile is not 1.
   - It also handles the case where all pile sizes are consecutive.
   - The program should correctly determine the winner for any valid input within the constraints.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
