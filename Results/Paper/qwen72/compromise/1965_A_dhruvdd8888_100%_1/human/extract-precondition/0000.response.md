Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the integers for a test case.
