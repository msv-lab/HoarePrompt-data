Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the number of test cases and the list of piles as parameters.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined without parameters. Inside the function, it reads the number of piles `N` and the list of pile sizes `nums` from the standard input. This is not ideal because the function should be able to handle these inputs as parameters, making it more modular and testable.

3. **Set and Sorting**: The program converts the input list `nums` to a set, adds '0' to it, and then converts it back to a sorted list of integers. This step is problematic because:
   - Adding '0' to the set can change the game dynamics, especially if the smallest pile is greater than 1.
   - Converting to a set removes duplicate pile sizes, which can affect the game outcome since the number of piles of a certain size matters.

4. **Game Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted list of pile sizes and subtracts the cumulative sum `ls` from each pile size. This is intended to simulate the removal of stones, but the logic is flawed:
   - The cumulative sum `ls` is added to each pile size, which is not the correct way to simulate the game. The game requires removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile, not adding to a cumulative sum.
   - The loop that updates `nw` and `cw` is intended to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with a certain size, but the logic is not clear and seems to be incorrect.

5. **Output**: The program prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on the final value of `cw`, but the logic to determine `cw` is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
