Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1()` does not take any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the number of piles and the list of pile sizes as parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - The function reads `N` (the number of piles) and then reads a list of integers from the input. This part is correct.
   - **Processing the List**:
     - The function converts the input list to a set, which removes duplicates. This is incorrect because the problem requires the exact number of stones in each pile, and removing duplicates changes the game state.
     - The function adds '0' to the set, which is unnecessary and can affect the sorting and subsequent logic.
     - The function sorts the set and converts it back to a list of integers. This is incorrect because the order of the original piles is important, and converting to a set and back to a list can change this order.
   - **Game Logic**:
     - The function initializes `ls` to 0 and then iterates over the sorted list, subtracting `ls` from each element and updating `ls` with the new value. This logic is incorrect because it modifies the pile sizes in a way that does not reflect the game rules.
     - The function then iterates over the modified list in reverse, toggling the `cw` (current winner) and `nw` (next winner) variables based on whether the current pile size is 1. This logic is also incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the game's turn-based removal of stones.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on the final value of `cw`. However, due to the incorrect processing and game logic, the output is likely to be incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
