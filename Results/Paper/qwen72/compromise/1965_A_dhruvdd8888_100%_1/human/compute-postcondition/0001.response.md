Initial State: The function should take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer.

```
nums = set(input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code `nums = set(input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and converts the resulting list into a set. The set `nums` will contain unique strings that were input.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input. The list of lists containing the initial number of stones in each pile remains unchanged.**
