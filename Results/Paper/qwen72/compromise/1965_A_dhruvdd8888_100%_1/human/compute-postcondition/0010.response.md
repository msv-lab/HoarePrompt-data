Output State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` remains the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is 0, `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`, `nw` is True, `cw` is True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the second-to-last element of `nums` to the second element (i.e., `i` ranges from `len(nums) - 2` to `1`).
- Since all elements in `nums` are 0, the condition `if nums[i] == 1` is never true.
- Therefore, the `else` block is always executed, setting `cw` to `True`.
- `nw` is then set to `cw`, which is `True`.
- As a result, both `nw` and `cw` remain `True` after all iterations of the loop.
