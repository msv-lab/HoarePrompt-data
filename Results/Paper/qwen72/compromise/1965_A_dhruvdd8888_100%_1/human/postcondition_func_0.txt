The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of stones. It then reads a list of integers from the input, processes it, and determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob. The game is based on the initial number of stones in the piles, and the function prints either "Alice" or "Bob" as the winner. After the function concludes, `t` remains the number of test cases, `N` remains the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is 0, and `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`. The list of lists containing the initial number of stones in each pile remains unchanged.
