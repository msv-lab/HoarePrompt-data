Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ..., p[n-2]` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd) respectively, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[1]` is `1 + n % 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, so `ind` becomes `3 + n % 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
