Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with `p[0]` set to `n`, `p[2]` set to `n - 2`, and `p[4]` set to `n - 4`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 4) with the value of `ind` (which is `n - 4`). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
