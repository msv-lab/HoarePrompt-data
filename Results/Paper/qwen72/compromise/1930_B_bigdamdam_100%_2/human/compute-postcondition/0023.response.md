Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `p[3]` is set to `ind - 2`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 5, `p[5]` is set to `ind`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is incremented by 2.
- The initial state indicates that `p[3]` was set to `ind` before `ind` was increased by 2, so `p[3]` is now `ind - 2`.
- The value of `p[5]` is set to the new value of `ind` after it has been incremented by 2.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
