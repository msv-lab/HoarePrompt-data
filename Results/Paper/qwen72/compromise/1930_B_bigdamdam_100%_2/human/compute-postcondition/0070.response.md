The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 for each iteration, starting from 1 and continuing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind`.
- `ind` is increased by 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 3. The loop will continue to execute if `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2**
