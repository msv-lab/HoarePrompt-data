Output State: **`n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind`, `p[3]` is assigned the value of `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2**

Explanation:
- `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`. Since `i` is 3, `p[3]` is now assigned the value of `ind`.
- `ind` is increased by 2, but its initial value is not specified, so we only note that it has been increased by 2.
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, and `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind`. These conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment `p[3] = ind` and the increment `ind = ind + 2`.
