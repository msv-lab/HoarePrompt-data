The loop head contains the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. However, since the function `func` should accept an integer `n` as a parameter and the loop is iterating based on an input, we need to ensure that the input is aligned with the parameter `n`.

Given the task, the function should accept `n` as a parameter, and the loop should iterate `n` times. Therefore, the input inside the loop head should be replaced with `n` to ensure the loop executes the correct number of times.

However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and that `i` is initialized correctly for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0**
