Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - 2` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `p[i]` is updated to `ind`.
- Since `ind` is `n - 2`, the element at index `i` in the list `p` is now `n - 2`.
- The other elements in `p` remain 0.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged.
