You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept an integer `n` as a parameter, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is the length of the permutation to be generated.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the last value of the range `n-1`, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the even-indexed elements (starting from index 0) are filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the odd-indexed elements are filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2. The variable `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n // 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and returns a permutation of length `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
