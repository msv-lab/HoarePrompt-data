Reasoning:  
The program is designed to generate a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. The approach taken by the program is to fill the even-indexed positions with the largest odd and even numbers in descending order, and the odd-indexed positions with the smallest odd and even numbers in ascending order. This strategy helps to avoid the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` because it ensures that the numbers are distributed in a way that avoids such divisibility relationships.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) with the largest numbers in descending order, starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - It fills the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) with the smallest numbers in ascending order, starting from `1 + n % 2` (which ensures the correct starting point for odd or even `n`).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated permutation for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Even-Indexed Filling**:
  - For even `n`, the even-indexed positions will be filled with the largest even numbers in descending order.
  - For odd `n`, the even-indexed positions will be filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
- **Odd-Indexed Filling**:
  - The odd-indexed positions are filled with the smallest odd or even numbers in ascending order, starting from `1 + n % 2`.

### Example Verification:
- **n = 4**:
  - Even-indexed: [4, 2]
  - Odd-indexed: [1, 3]
  - Result: [4, 1, 2, 3]
  - This permutation is valid because there are no `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

- **n = 3**:
  - Even-indexed: [3, 1]
  - Odd-indexed: [2]
  - Result: [3, 1, 2]
  - This permutation is valid because there are no `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that the permutation is valid by distributing the numbers in a way that avoids the specified divisibility conditions.
