### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func` does not take any parameters. However, it reads the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case from user input. This is a common practice for competitive programming problems but should be noted for clarity.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the value of `n`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even-indexed positions (starting from index 0) with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - After that, it fills the odd-indexed positions with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2.

4. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed elements are in descending order and the odd-indexed elements are in ascending order.
   - This construction ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. This is because:
     - Even-indexed elements are large and odd-indexed elements are small, making it unlikely for an even-indexed element to divide an odd-indexed element.
     - The descending and ascending patterns prevent any two consecutive elements from being divisors of each other.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the generated permutation for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
