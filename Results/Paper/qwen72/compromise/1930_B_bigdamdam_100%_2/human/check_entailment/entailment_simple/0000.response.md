Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it reads the input directly within the function. This is acceptable for the given problem, as the input is read from standard input. However, it would be more conventional to pass the number of test cases and the length of the permutation as parameters.

2. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - Next, it fills the odd indices of `p` with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2.

4. **Output**: The function prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

5. **Correctness of the Permutation**:
   - The permutation is constructed such that even indices contain the largest values in descending order, and odd indices contain the smallest values in ascending order.
   - This ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. This is because the values at even indices are large and not likely to divide the smaller values at odd indices, and vice versa.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is valid, and the function correctly generates it.
   - For `n = 4`, the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` is valid, and the function correctly generates it.
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.

7. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the program is as described in the comments. The permutation `p` is correctly constructed and printed for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
