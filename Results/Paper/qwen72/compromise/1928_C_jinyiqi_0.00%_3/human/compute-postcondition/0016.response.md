Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order, and `output2` is a list of the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in descending order.**

The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The list `output1` initially contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in ascending order. After the reversal, `output1` contains these same divisors but in descending order. The list `output2` remains unchanged, still containing the divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in descending order. The value of `x` also remains unchanged.
