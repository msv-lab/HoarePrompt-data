Output State: **The program returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`, where `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` is a list of the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` in descending order.**
