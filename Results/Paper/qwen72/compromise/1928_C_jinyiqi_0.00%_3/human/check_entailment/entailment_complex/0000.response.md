### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Vasya is in position `n` and received the number `x` during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to find all possible values of `k` such that the given position `n` and number `x` fit the settling pattern.

2. **Settling Pattern:**
   - The pattern is: 1, 2, 3, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., k, ...
   - This means that for a given `k`, the numbers repeat every `2k - 2` positions.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If Vasya is in position `n` and received number `x`, then `n` must be congruent to `x` modulo `2k - 2` or `n` must be congruent to `2k - 1 - x` modulo `2k - 2`.
   - This is because the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of length `k`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two potential values: `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It then calls `func_1` on these values to get a list of divisors.
   - The divisors are checked to see if they can form valid `k` values.
   - The valid `k` values are collected in the `output` list and then deduplicated using `set`.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` returns a list of all divisors of `x` in descending order.
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of `x` and returns them in the required format.

6. **Checking Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program checks if the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` can form valid `k` values.
   - A valid `k` must satisfy two conditions:
     - `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` (i.e., `s + 2` must be even, which means `s` must be even).
     - `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` (i.e., the potential `k` must be at least `x`).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `k = 1` is not allowed.
   - The program also correctly handles the constraints `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

8. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies and counts all valid `k` values for each test case.
   - The logic for checking the divisors and forming valid `k` values is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It correctly identifies and counts all possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints for each test case.
