Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, `s` is 0. If `b` is non-empty, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` is empty and the character at index 3 in `b` is '*', the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
