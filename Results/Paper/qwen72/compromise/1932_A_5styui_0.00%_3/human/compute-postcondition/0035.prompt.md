Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least one character, and `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '@', `s` is set to 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', or if the first character is not '*' and the second character is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains 0 and the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, and `s` is 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `b`. If the second character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`) is '@', `s` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on the first character of `b`. If the second character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the second character of `b` is neither '@' nor '*', the program continues execution normally.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, and `s` is 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `b`. If the third character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`) is '@', `s` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on the first character of `b`. If the third character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the third character of `b` is neither '@' nor '*', the program continues execution normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
