### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries, each of which compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), the length of the permutation \(p\).

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and asks the query `? mak mak i i`.
   - The purpose of this query is to find the index `mak` such that \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\) is the maximum among all \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `mak` to the current index \(i\).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to `mak` and `pans` to an empty list.
   - It iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and asks the query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
   - The purpose of this query is to find the index `mak` such that \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\) is the maximum among all \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\).
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `mak` to the current index \(i\) and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `=`, it appends the current index \(i\) to `pans`.

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices in `pans` and asks the query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
   - The purpose of this query is to find the index `mak` in `pans` such that \(p_{pans[mak]} \oplus p_{pans[i]}\) is the maximum among all pairs in `pans`.
   - If the response is `>`, it updates `mak` to the current index \(i\).

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the answer.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
  - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
  - The third loop makes at most \(n-1\) queries.
  - Total queries: \(n-1 + n + n-1 = 3n-2\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

- **Logic:**
  - The first loop correctly finds the index `mak` such that \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\) is the maximum.
  - The second loop correctly finds the index `mak` such that \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\) is the maximum, and it also collects indices that have the same maximum OR value.
  - The third loop correctly finds the pair of indices in `pans` that maximizes \(p_{pans[mak]} \oplus p_{pans[i]}\).

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and stays within the query limit. Therefore, it should correctly find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**
