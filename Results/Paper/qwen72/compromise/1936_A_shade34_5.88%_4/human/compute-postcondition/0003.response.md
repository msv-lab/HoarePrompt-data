The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through queries and responses. The sequence `p` is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` from a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} that maximize the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ⊕ p_j`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this.**
