Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains the same as the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'. `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. `temp` is now an empty set.**
