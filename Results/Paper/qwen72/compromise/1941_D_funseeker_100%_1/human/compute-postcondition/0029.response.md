To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `ans`. The loop will execute if `ans` is not empty. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`ans` must be non-empty**: The loop will only execute if `ans` contains at least one element. The state of `ans` depends on the value of `c`:
   - If `c` is '?', `ans` should contain the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - If `c` is '1', `ans` should contain the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - If `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?', `ans` remains the same as the original `ans`.

2. **`q` must be an element of `ans`**: This is automatically satisfied if `ans` is non-empty, as `q` will take on the values of the elements in `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `m` is `m - 1`.
- `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains the same as the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'.
- `temp` is an empty set.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `ans` is non-empty. We can assume that `ans` is non-empty if `c` is either '?' or '1' and the original `ans` is non-empty. If `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?', `ans` should remain non-empty if it was non-empty initially.

State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must be a non-empty set, `temp` is an empty set**.
