Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now an empty set, and `temp` contains all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `r` remains the same as the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- The value of `c` remains the same as the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- The value of `n` is unchanged.
- The value of `m` is reduced by the length of the original `ans` plus one.
- The value of `x` remains the same as the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` is now empty.
- The set `temp` contains all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.
