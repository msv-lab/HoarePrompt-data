Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `temp` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `temp`, but the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `temp` being an empty set.
