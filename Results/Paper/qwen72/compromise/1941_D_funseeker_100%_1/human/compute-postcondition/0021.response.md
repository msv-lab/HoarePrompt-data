Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. If `c` is '0', `temp` is an empty set. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` if it was already added. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
