Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to an empty set, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation:
- `temp` is set to an empty set.
- `ans` is now equal to `temp`, which is an empty set.
- The values of `r`, `c`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
