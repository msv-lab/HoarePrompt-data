Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to an empty set, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0' or '?', in which case `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, and `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
