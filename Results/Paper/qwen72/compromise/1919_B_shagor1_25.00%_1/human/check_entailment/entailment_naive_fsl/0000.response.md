Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the number of '-' characters and then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
+-+-+
```
The string `s` is `"+-+-+"`, which translates to the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`.

The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is:
- `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1])` which has a sum of `1` and a length of `5`, giving a penalty of `|1| * 5 = 5`.

However, the program will output:
- `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 2 = 1`.

This is incorrect because the minimum possible penalty for this input is `5`, not `1`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
