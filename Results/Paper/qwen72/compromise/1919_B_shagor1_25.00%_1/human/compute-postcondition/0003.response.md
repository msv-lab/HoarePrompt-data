To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will iterate over the string `s`, so for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The variable `neg` and the integer `t` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is assigned the value of an input string.
- `neg` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` will be the first character of `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `s`, `neg` is 0**
