Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and possibly `i` if `i <= k`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains `x // i` and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`. Otherwise, `l` does not contain `x // i` and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.***
