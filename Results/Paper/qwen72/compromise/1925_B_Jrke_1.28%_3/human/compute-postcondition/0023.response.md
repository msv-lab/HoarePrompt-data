Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 3 if `x % 2 != 0` or 4 if `x % 2 == 0`, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.** 

The value `x // i` is appended to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
