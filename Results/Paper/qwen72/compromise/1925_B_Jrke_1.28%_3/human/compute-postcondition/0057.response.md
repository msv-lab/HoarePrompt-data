Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `[ans, i]`, `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^3.
- `x` remains the first integer input that satisfies the condition `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`.
- `i` is incremented by 2, so its new value is `i + 2`.
- `l` is a list that initially contains `[ans]`. After the code execution, `i` is appended to the list, so `l` now contains `[ans, i]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.
