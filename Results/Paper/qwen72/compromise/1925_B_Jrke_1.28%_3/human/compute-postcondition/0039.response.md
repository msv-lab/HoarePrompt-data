Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is the value of `x`.** 

The value of `k` is updated to the integer division of `x` by `n`, while the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still the value of `x`.
