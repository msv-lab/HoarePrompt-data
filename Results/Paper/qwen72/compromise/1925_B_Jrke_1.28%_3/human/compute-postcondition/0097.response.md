Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` contains the value 1. If `x // (int(x) + 2) <= k`, `l` also contains the value `x // (int(x) + 2)`. If `i` <= `k`, `l` also contains the value `int(x) + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value in the list `l`.
- The list `l` initially contains the value 1.
- Depending on the conditions, `l` may also contain the values `x // (int(x) + 2)` and `int(x) + 2`.
- The maximum value in `l` is assigned to `ans`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`) retain their previous values and conditions.
