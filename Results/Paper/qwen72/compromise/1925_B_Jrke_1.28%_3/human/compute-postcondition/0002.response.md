Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input, where both values are integers and `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, and the input value is greater than 0; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`).**
