Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input). If `k` == 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
