Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `[ans]`, `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so `i` is now `i + 2`.
- The list `l` is assigned a new value, which is a list containing the current value of `ans`.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.
