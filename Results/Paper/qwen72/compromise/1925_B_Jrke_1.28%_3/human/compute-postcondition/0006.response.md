Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input, where both values are integers and `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, and the input value is greater than 0; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`). If `k` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
