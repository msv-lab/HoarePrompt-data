Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 2`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `int(x) + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `l`.
- `i` is defined as `int(x) + 2`.
- The list `l` initially contains the value 1.
- After appending `i`, the list `l` now contains the values 1 and `int(x) + 2`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
