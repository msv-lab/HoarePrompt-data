Output State: **The list `a` remains unchanged, `s` contains the concatenated string from `a[0]` up to the first occurrence of '1' in `a[0]` and the rest of the string from `a[1]` starting from the position where `a[1]` has a '0', or if no such condition is met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. `t` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` is the index where the condition was met or `n-1` if the condition was never met.**
