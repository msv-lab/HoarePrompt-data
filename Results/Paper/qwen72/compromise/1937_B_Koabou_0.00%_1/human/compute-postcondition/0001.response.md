Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ `n[i]` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples `grid` where each `grid[i]` contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × `n[i]` grid. The total sum of all `n[i]` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
