The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value before being appended to `arr`.

- If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is reduced by 2, making `lex` less than 26.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 27, making `lex` greater than or equal to 1 and less than 26.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than or equal to 0 and less than 26.
- If `lex` is 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` 26.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`], [26, 1, `lex`], [1, 26, `lex`], [26, 26, `lex`], or [26, 26, `lex`] depending on the initial value of `lex`. The value of `lex` is adjusted as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is `lex - 2`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is `lex - 27`; if `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `lex` is `lex - 52`; if `lex` is 78, `lex` is 26; if `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is `lex - 52`.**
