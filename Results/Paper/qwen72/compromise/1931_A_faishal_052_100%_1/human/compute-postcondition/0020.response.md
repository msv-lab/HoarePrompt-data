The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value, which is fixed at 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since the range is 2, the loop will still execute when `j` is 1.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 52.**
