The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the elements of the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the conditions for updating `arr` based on the value of `lex`, we can determine the sorted state of `arr`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`. After sorting, `arr` remains `[1, 1, lex - 2]` since the first two elements are already the smallest and equal.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`. After sorting, `arr` remains `[26, 26, lex - 52]` since the first two elements are already the smallest and equal.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`. After sorting, `arr` remains `[26, 26, lex - 52]` since the first two elements are already the smallest and equal.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`. After sorting, `arr` remains `[26, 26, lex - 52]` since the first two elements are already the smallest and equal.

Since the sorting operation does not change the values of `cases`, `i`, `info`, or `j`, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.**
