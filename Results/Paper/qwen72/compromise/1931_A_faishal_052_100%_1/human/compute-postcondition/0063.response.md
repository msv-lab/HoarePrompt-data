The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is fixed at 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` is either an empty list if `lex` > 78 or contains the element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive).**
