The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After executing the code, `arr` contains one element, which is `1`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1]**.
