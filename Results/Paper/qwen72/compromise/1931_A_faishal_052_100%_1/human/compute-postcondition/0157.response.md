The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the value `range`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `range`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `range` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `range` remains 3.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96` and `info[2][1] + 96`, `j` is 2, `range` is 3**
