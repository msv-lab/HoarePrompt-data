Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `temp` contains the characters corresponding to the first three elements of the first array in the `info` list, converted to their respective lowercase letters using the ASCII values. The loop counter `j` is 2, indicating that the loop has run 3 times (from 0 to 2). The other variables (`cases`, `i`, and `info`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
