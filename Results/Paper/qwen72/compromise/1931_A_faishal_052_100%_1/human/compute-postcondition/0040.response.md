Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `arr` is [1], [26], or an empty list depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is less than 26 or greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51 or 25 depending on the initial conditions, and `arr` is [1, 1], [26, 1], or [1] depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 26 if it is less than 52, and `arr` is updated to [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` remains as it was initially, which is less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26 depending on the initial conditions.***
