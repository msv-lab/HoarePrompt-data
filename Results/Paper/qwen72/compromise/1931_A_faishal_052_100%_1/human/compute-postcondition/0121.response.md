The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. Since `arr` was not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is a new list that starts empty. After appending 26, `arr` contains one element, which is 26. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is [26]**.
