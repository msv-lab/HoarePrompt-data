Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`, `j` is 3, `range` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` remains an integer greater than 1.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `info` is still a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions.
- The variable `temp` now contains a string with three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of the respective element in `info[1]` plus 96 (i.e., `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`).
- The variable `j` is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `range` remains 3, as it defines the number of iterations the loop will execute.
