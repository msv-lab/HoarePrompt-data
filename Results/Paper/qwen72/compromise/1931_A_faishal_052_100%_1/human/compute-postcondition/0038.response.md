Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `arr` is [1], [26], or an empty list depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 26, and `arr` is updated to [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` remains as it was initially, which is less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26 depending on the initial conditions.***
