Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `info` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex < 28:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        elif lex <= 78:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    info.append(arr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted as `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]` (or any permutation of the last two elements).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus `arr`), `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and `lex` is reduced by 2 if `lex` is less than 28, by 52 if `lex` is between 28 and 78 inclusive, and remains unchanged if `lex` is greater than 78.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
