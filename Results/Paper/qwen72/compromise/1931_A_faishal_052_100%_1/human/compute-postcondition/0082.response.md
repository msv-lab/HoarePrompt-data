Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, and `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` remains unchanged.***
