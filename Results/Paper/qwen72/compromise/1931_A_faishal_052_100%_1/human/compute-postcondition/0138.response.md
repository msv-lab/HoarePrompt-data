Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2.** 

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][2] + 96)` to the string `temp`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j` remain unchanged. The updated `temp` now includes the characters from `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` converted to their respective ASCII characters.
