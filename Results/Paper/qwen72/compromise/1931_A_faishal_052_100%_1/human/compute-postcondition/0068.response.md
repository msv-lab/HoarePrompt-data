The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` already contains one element based on the value of `lex`. After appending 26, `arr` will now contain two elements. The first element depends on the value of `lex` as follows:

- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` initially contains the element 1.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` initially contains the element 26.
- If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` initially contains the element 26.
- If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` is either an empty list if `lex` > 78 or contains the element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive).

After appending 26, the new state of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` will be `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` will be `[26]`.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]`.**
