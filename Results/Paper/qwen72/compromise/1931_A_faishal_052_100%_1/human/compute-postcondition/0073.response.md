The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range value `2`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `1` (inclusive), meaning it runs twice. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, but since the loop is defined to run for `j` in the range of 2 (i.e., `j` values of 0 and 1), the loop will not execute again after `j` reaches 2.

However, since the task is to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and given that the loop is designed to run exactly two times, the state should reflect the final value of `j` before the loop exits, which is 2. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `arr`, and `lex`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not change in this context.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` was less than 28, or `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` if `lex` was less than 28 or between 28 and 52 (inclusive). If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, `arr` is updated to contain the element 26 appended to its previous contents, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` remains unchanged.**
