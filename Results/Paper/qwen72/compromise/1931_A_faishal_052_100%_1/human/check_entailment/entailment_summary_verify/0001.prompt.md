You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) is provided, representing an encoded value. The function processes each `n` to determine and print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, with each word printed on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state includes the variable `cases` holding the number of test cases, `info` containing a list of sorted arrays, each with three elements derived from the input, and `i` and `j` holding the last indices used in the loops.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the letters should equal `n`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.
   - It then iterates over the range 2 (for the first two letters) and checks the value of `lex` (the remaining sum):
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the indices are in ascending order, which helps in finding the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Finally, it converts the indices to characters and prints the resulting word.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `lex` is less than 28, between 28 and 52, and between 52 and 78.
   - The sorting step ensures that the smallest possible combination of letters is used.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the logic for handling the values of `lex`. Specifically, the conditions for appending 1 or 26 to `arr` might not always produce the correct result.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for appending 1 or 26 to `arr` is not optimal. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will append 1 twice and then 25, which is not the lexicographically smallest combination.
   - A better approach would be to always try to use the smallest possible values first and adjust the remaining sum accordingly.

5. **Corrected Approach:**
   - Instead of using fixed values like 1 and 26, we should try to use the smallest possible values first and adjust the remaining sum.
   - For example, if `lex` is 27, we should use 'a' (1), 'a' (1), and 'y' (25) to get the lexicographically smallest word "aay".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word due to the fixed values used in the conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
