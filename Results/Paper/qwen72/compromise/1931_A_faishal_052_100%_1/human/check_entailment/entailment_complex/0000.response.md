Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded values for each test case.
2. **Processing Logic**:
   - The logic attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by assigning the largest possible value to the first two letters and the remainder to the third letter.
   - However, the logic for determining the values of the letters is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if lex < 28` and `elif lex < 52` do not always ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the current logic will set the first two letters to 'a' (1) and the third letter to 22 ('v'), resulting in "aav". This is correct, but it fails in other cases.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` ensures that the letters are in lexicographical order, but the initial assignment of values can still be incorrect.
   - The conversion from the numerical values to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` is correct, as it converts the index (1-based) to the corresponding character.

### Example Analysis:
- For `lex = 24`, the correct output is "aav".
- For `lex = 70`, the correct output is "rzz".
- For `lex = 3`, the correct output is "aaa".
- For `lex = 55`, the correct output is "czz".
- For `lex = 48`, the correct output is "auz".

### Flawed Logic:
- The condition `if lex < 28` and `elif lex < 52` does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `lex = 55`, the current logic will set the first two letters to 'z' (26) and the third letter to 3, resulting in "zzc" instead of "czz".

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
- A better approach would be to use a greedy algorithm to assign the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then calculate the third letter.

### Conclusion:
The current logic does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
