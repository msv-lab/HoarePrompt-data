Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. This condition is not correctly determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `5 2 2`
- According to the problem description, Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Bob can always repaint 2 parts to match the color of the remaining 3 parts, making all parts the same color.
- However, the program incorrectly prints `Yes` for this case.

The correct condition should be `n - k > m` to ensure that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, there are still more than `m` parts left that are of different colors, making it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color. The current condition does not correctly handle this logic.
