Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` were read from user input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the loop printed 'NO'. Otherwise, it printed 'Yes'. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged after the loop, but the loop has completed all its iterations.**
