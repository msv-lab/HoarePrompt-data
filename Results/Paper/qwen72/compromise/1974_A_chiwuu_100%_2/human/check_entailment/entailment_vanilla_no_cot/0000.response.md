Correctness: **False**

The program provided is not entirely correct. The logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed. Specifically, the way it handles the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is incorrect.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by 2 and then adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a single screen can hold up to 3 such icons (since 5x3 = 15 cells and 3 * 4 = 12 cells).
   - The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is to use the ceiling of the division of `b` by 3, which can be done using `(b + 2) // 3`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons by multiplying the number of screens by 15 and subtracting the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons. This is not necessary and can be simplified.
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space on the screens should be used to place the 1x1 icons. The remaining space on the last screen with 2x2 icons should be calculated correctly.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is correct in principle but should be applied to the correct remaining space calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on the last screen with 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - 4 * b
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_space >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_space
            additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15  # Ceiling of division by 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated correctly and that the remaining space is used efficiently for 1x1 icons.
