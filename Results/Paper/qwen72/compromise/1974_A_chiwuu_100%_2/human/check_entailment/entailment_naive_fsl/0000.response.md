Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as follows:

```python
t = b
if t % 2 == 0:
    t = t // 2
else:
    t = t // 2 + 1
```

This logic is incorrect because it assumes that each 2x2 icon requires half a screen, which is not true. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows and 3 columns). Therefore, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be calculated based on the total number of cells occupied by these icons.

For example, consider the input `x = 0` and `y = 1`:
- The program will calculate `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
- However, for `x = 0` and `y = 2`, the program will calculate `t = 2 // 2 = 1`, which is incorrect because 2 2x2 icons require 8 cells, and 8 cells cannot fit into a single screen of 15 cells.

The correct logic should be:
```python
t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
```

This ensures that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated correctly by considering the total number of cells occupied by these icons and dividing by the number of cells per screen (15), rounding up to the nearest whole number.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The logic for calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons is also flawed. The program should correctly calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

For example, consider the input `x = 1` and `y = 1`:
- The program will calculate `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1` for the 2x2 icon.
- It will then calculate `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is correct.
- However, it will then check if `t1 >= a` and print `t = 1`, which is incorrect because the 1x1 icon cannot fit into the remaining 11 cells of the screen.

The correct logic should be:
```python
t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
if t1 >= a:
    print(t)
else:
    t2 = a - t1
    t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15
    print(t)
```

This ensures that the remaining space for 1x1 icons is correctly calculated and that the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons is correctly determined.
