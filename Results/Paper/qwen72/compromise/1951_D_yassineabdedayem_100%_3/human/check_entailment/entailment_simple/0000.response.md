### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.
   - This part of the program is correct as it follows the problem's input format.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if n == k`
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this stall.
     - This is a valid and correct condition.
   - **Case 2**: `elif n + 2 > k * 2`
     - This condition checks if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel.
     - The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` simplifies to `n + 2 > 2k`, which further simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`.
     - If `n > 2k - 2`, Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall (since the price is `n - k + 1`), and then 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
     - This is a valid and correct condition.
   - **Case 3**: `else`
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - This is also a valid and correct condition.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.
   - If the answer is "YES", it prints the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.
   - The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and produces the correct output for each test case. The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
