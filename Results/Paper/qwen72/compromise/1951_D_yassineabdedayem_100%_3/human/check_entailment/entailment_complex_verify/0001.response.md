### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by two lines, each containing the number 1. This is a valid solution because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from the single stall.

3. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, it means Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The first stall will allow Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels (since `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k`), and the second stall will allow her to buy the remaining 1 jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the pricing scheme as `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is a valid solution because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

4. **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
   - If the condition `n + 2 <= k * 2` is true, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys from the cheapest possible stalls.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" in this case. This is because if `n + 2 <= k * 2`, then `n <= 2 * k - 2`, which implies that Alice cannot buy `k` jewels even if she buys from the cheapest stalls (each with a price of 1 coin per jewel).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is just slightly more than `k` by setting up two stalls with appropriate prices.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The logic in the program ensures that if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "YES" and a valid pricing scheme.
   - If Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "NO".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and it provides a valid pricing scheme when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
