You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Annotated Code: 
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The value of t is 0, and for each test case, the values of n and k are processed and the corresponding output ('YES' or 'NO') is printed based on the conditions in the loop. The values of n and k for each test case are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` equals `k`, and if so, prints 'YES' followed by two lines, each containing the number 1. If `n` does not equal `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines: the first line contains `n - k + 1`, and the second line contains 1. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, and the value of `t` is 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the pricing scheme as `1` (one stall with price 1).

3. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, it means Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The first stall will allow Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels (since `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k`), and the second stall will allow her to buy the remaining 1 jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the pricing scheme as `n - k + 1` and `1`.

4. **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
   - If the condition `n + 2 <= k * 2` is true, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys from the cheapest possible stalls.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is just slightly more than `k` by setting up two stalls with appropriate prices.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The logic in the program ensures that if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "YES" and a valid pricing scheme.
   - If Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and it provides a valid pricing scheme when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
