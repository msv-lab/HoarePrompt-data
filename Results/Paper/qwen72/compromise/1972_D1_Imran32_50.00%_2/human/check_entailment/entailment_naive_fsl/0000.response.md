Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be calculating a different value, which is not aligned with the problem statement. For example, for the input `2 3`, the correct output should be `3` (pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2)), but the program will not produce this output.
