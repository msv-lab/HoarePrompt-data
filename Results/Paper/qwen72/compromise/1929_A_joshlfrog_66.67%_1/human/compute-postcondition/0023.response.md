Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The variable `e` remains 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `l` remains the input integer that represents the length of the list `nums`.
- The list `nums` remains the same as the input list of integers.
- The variable `x` is updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums` after all iterations of the loop.
- The variable `y` is updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums` after all iterations of the loop.
