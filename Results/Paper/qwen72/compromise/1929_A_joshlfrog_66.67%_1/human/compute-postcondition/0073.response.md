Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the last list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the last list `nums`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- The variable `e` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `l` holds the last input integer provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `nums` contains the last list of integers provided by the user during the last iteration.
- The variable `i` is `l-1`, which is the last index of the list `nums` that was processed.
- The variable `x` holds the maximum value found in the last list `nums`.
- The variable `y` holds the minimum value found in the last list `nums`.

The loop has processed `t` lists of integers, and for each list, it has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that list. After all iterations, the loop variables reflect the state of the last processed list.
