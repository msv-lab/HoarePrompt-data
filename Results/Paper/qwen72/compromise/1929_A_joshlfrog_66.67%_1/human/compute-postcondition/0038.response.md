Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` (whichever is smaller), `x` is the value of `nums[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `nums[1]` because `i` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` could have been updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was less than 100000000, otherwise, it remains 100000000.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `x` is now specifically the value of `nums[1]`.
