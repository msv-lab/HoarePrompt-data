Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `y` is 100000000. If `nums[0]` < `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` > 0, `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`. `x` is the value of `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` > 0, otherwise `x` remains 0. If `nums[1]` > `x`, then `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]` (whichever is the smallest). If `nums[2]` is less than the previous value of `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[2]`. If `nums[2]` is greater than the previous value of `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is greater and > 0), or 0 if no such value exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
