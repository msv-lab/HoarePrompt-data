The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `l` (which is not necessarily the same as `n`), where `2 <= l <= 100`, and a list of `l` integers, each between `1` and `10^9`. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints this difference. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the differences between the maximum and minimum values of each list have been printed.
