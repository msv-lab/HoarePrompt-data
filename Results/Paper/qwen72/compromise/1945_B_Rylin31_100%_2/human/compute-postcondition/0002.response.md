Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, then print the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`. After all iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be undefined or reset to their initial input values for the next iteration, if any. The value of `t` will remain unchanged.**
