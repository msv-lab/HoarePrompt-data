You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Example

Input

    6
    
    6 7 4
    
    3 4 10
    
    7 8 56
    
    5 6 78123459896
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 1000000000000000000

Output

    2
    7
    17
    28645268630
    4
    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks from two installations, and `m` is the visibility duration of each firework. The function then calculates and prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are undefined or reset for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap in visibility times correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
2 // 6 + 2 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```
This happens to be correct for this specific input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

Consider another input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The correct output should be 7, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```
Again, this happens to be correct for this specific input, but the logic is flawed.

A more critical case is:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The correct output should be 4, but the program will output:
```
1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```
This is correct, but the program does not handle the general case correctly. For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The correct output should be 22, but the program will output:
```
10 // 1 + 10 // 1 + 2 = 10 + 10 + 2 = 22
```
However, the logic in the program does not account for the fact that the visibility period of each firework is \(m + 1\) minutes, and it does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
