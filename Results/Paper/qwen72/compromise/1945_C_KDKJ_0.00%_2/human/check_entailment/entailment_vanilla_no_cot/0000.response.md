Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates the prefix sums for the number of zeros and ones up to each house. This is done in the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains the number of zeros and ones up to the `i-1`-th house.

3. **Condition Checking**: For each possible position `i` to lay the road (from 0 to `n-1`), the program checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side and if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side. This is done using the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program keeps track of the position `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions. This ensures that the road is laid as close to the middle of the village as possible.

5. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
