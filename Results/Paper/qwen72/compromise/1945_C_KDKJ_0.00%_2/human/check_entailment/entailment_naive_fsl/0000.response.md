Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the edge case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, the program does not consider the case where the entire village should be declared as one side (either left or right) to satisfy the condition. For example, if the input is:

```
1
3
000
```

The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house (i.e., all houses on the right side) satisfies the condition. However, the program will output `3` because it does not correctly handle this edge case.
