The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameter constraints and no specific output conditions provided, we cannot determine a specific return value from the information given. However, typically, a function without parameters and without a specified return value might return `None` by default in Python, or it could perform some action without returning a value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and may return `None` or perform an action without returning a value.**
