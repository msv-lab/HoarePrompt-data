To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

The state of `S`, `ans`, and `satisfy` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state. However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we will not modify `S`, `ans`, or `satisfy`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
