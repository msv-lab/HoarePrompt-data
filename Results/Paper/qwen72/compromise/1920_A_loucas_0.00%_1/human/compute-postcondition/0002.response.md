Output State: **The variable `loop` is decremented by the number of iterations executed, and the variable `num` holds the first integer that satisfies the conditions for each test case (i.e., it is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, less than the minimum value in `less`, and not in `no`). The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are reset to empty for each iteration of the outer loop. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints remain unchanged.**
