Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each case.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
   \]
   - The term `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points scored by all players.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because the highest score can only be achieved by winning games or drawing, but not by an unrealistic number of wins.
   - The division by 2 converts the total points into the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

The logic and calculations used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements and handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
