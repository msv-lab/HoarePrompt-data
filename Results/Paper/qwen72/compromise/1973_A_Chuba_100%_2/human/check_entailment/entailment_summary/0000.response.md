### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/lose scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the following logic:
     - The total points scored by all players is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])`.
     - The maximum number of points that can be scored without any draws is `2 * (number of games)`.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` accounts for the scenario where the highest score `v[2]` is more than the sum of the other two scores `v[0] + v[1]`. If this is the case, the excess points must come from wins, not draws.
     - Subtracting this excess from the total points gives the maximum number of points that could have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are not consistent.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Total points: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
  - No games were played, so no draws: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Total points: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - One game ended in a draw: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Total points: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Total points: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - Two games, both ending in draws: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Total points: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Total points: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
  - Six games, all ending in draws: `6`
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
  - Two games, one draw and one win/lose: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the consistency of the scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws for each test case. The logic and the formula used are sound and match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
