The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need an initial value for the loop to start.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are input integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
