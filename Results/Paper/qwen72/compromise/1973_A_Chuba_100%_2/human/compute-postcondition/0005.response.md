Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on these scores, or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remain unchanged. **
