The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3 and `x` must still satisfy the condition that `3` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 2, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output1` is a list containing `[2]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `output1` remains a list containing `[1]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output1` remains an empty list. `output2` remains a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list.**
