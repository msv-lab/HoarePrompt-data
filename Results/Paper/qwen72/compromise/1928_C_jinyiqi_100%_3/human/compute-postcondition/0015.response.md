Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. The loop variable `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` after the loop finishes.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to `output1` and `int(x / i)` is added to `output2`.
- After the loop finishes, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` because the loop runs until `i` is just greater than `int(x ** 0.5)`.
