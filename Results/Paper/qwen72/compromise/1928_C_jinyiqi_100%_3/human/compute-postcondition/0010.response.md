Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by 2, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output1` is a list containing `[2]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `output1` remains a list containing `[1]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output1` remains an empty list. `output2` remains a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by 1, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list.***
