Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the second tuple in `test_cases`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`. The `count` variable is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`. The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys that are the remainders of each `num` in `arr` when divided by `x`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appears. The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys that are the remainders of each `num` in `arr` when divided by `y`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appears. The `num` variable is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x`, and `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` list now contains three elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, the second element is the same final value of `count`, and the third element is the updated value of `count` after the execution of the code, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code and the accumulated values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each element in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains keys corresponding to the unique values of `num % x` for each element in `arr`, with values equal to the number of occurrences of each unique `num % x` value, `mod_y_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains keys corresponding to the unique values of `num % y` for each element in `arr`, with values equal to the number of occurrences of each unique `num % y` value, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` where `num` is the last element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
