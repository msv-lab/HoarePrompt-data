The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1. For each subsequent element from `d-1` to the end of the list, it updates the element to the minimum of the previous `d` elements (including the first `d-1` elements and the updated elements) plus the original value of that element plus 1. The function returns the last element of the updated `row` list.
