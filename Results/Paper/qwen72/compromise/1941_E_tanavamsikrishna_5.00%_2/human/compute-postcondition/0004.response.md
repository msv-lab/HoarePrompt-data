To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the state and the loop head:

1. **State before the loop starts:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers provided by the input.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers, with specific conditions.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.

2. **Loop head:**
   ```
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.
   - This means `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `len(costs)` must be at least `k` for the loop to execute.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(costs)` is at least `k` and `i` is 0.

**State:**
**`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers provided by the input, `rows` is now a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers as provided by the input, where `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` and `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m`. `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, and `len(costs)` must be at least `k`. `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0.**
