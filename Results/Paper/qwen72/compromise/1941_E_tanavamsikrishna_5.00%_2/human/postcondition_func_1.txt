The function `func_2` reads four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input, followed by `n` rows of `m` integers each. It then computes the cost for each row using the function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`. The function calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`. The function does not return any value.
