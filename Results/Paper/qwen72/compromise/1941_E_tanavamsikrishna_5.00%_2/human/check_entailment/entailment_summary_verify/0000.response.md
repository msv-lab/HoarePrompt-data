### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge in a single row, given the maximum distance \(d\) between supports.
   - The function starts by adding 1 to the first \(d-1\) elements of the row, which is incorrect. This step does not account for the requirement that supports must be installed at the first and last columns.
   - The function then iterates over the rest of the row, calculating the cost for each cell as the minimum cost of the previous \(d+1\) cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports.

2. **Distance Constraint Violation:**
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). The function `func_1` does not correctly handle this constraint.
   - For example, in the row `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` with \(d = 2\), the correct supports should be installed at columns 1, 3, and 5. However, the function `func_1` will incorrectly calculate the cost by considering the minimum of the previous \(d+1\) cells, which can lead to supports being placed too far apart.

3. **Example Input Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3 5 1 2
     0 1 0 1 0
     0 2 2 2 0
     0 3 3 3 0
     ```
   - The correct output should be 4, as the minimum cost of building a bridge in the first row is 4 (installing supports at columns 1, 3, and 5).
   - However, the program will output 6 because it incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the middle cells without considering the correct distance constraint.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach is needed. The idea is to maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to build a bridge up to column \(j\) in row \(i\), ensuring that the distance constraint is met.
   - The transition between states should consider the cost of installing supports and the distance constraint.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
