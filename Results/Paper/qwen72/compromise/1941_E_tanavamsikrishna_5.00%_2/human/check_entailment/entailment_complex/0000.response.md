Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river grid.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which is correct because these elements are within the first `d` cells and must have supports.
   - For the remaining elements, it updates each element to the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus the original value of that element plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which is the total cost of installing supports for that row. This is correct because the last element will have the cumulative cost of the supports installed in that row.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case and processes it.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads `n` rows of the river grid and stores them in the list `rows`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the list `costs`.
   - It computes the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in `costs` and stores these sums in the list `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem.
   - For each test case, it correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - The logic and the implementation of both functions align with the problem requirements and constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
