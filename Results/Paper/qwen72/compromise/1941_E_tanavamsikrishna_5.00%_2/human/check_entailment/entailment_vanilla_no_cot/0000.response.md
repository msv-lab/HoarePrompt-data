Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because of the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. However, the way it updates the row costs is flawed. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This line incorrectly calculates the minimum cost. It should consider the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d` and add the cost of the current cell plus one. The correct logic should be:
   ```python
   row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1
   ```

2. **Handling of the First `d-1` Cells:** The first `d-1` cells are being updated without considering the minimum cost from previous cells. This is incorrect because the first `d-1` cells should also follow the same logic as the rest of the cells.

3. **Overall Cost Calculation in `func_2`:** The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost. However, the issue in `func_1` affects the correctness of the overall solution.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List

# Function 1:
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    dp = [0] * len(row)
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # First cell must have a support
    for i in range(1, len(row)):
        if i < d:
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + row[i] + 1
        else:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - d:i]) + row[i] + 1
    return dp[-1]

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`:** We use a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the minimum cost of installing supports up to each cell. The first cell must have a support, so `dp[0]` is initialized to `row[0] + 1`. For each subsequent cell, we calculate the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells and adding the cost of the current cell plus one.

2. **Correct Calculation for the First `d-1` Cells:** The first `d-1` cells are handled correctly by simply adding the cost of the previous cell plus the current cell cost plus one.

3. **Overall Cost Calculation in `func_2`:** The function `func_2` remains the same, but now it uses the corrected `func_1` to calculate the costs for each row. It then finds the minimum total cost for any set of `k` consecutive rows.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem description.
