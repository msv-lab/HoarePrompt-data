### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell to include the cost of installing a support.
   - For the first `d-1` cells, it simply adds 1 to the depth.
   - For the remaining cells, it finds the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to build the bridge on that row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid and processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `d` is 1, meaning supports must be installed in every cell.
   - The function also handles the edge case where `d` is large enough to cover the entire row, meaning supports can be installed only at the river banks.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of columns.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is `O(t * n * m)`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of rows, and `m` is the number of columns.
   - This is efficient given the constraints.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The first loop correctly increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
  - The second loop correctly updates each element from `d-1` to the end of the list by finding the minimum of the previous `d` elements (excluding the current element) and adding the current cell's depth plus 1.
  - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which is the minimum cost for building the bridge on that row.
  - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at each key point.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
  - It reads the grid and processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
  - It correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
  - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
  - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at each key point.

### Conclusion:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by considering the cost of installing supports and the maximum distance `d`.
  - The logic for updating the cost of each cell is correct and follows the problem's constraints.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost.
  - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and meets all the constraints and requirements.

Final: **True**
