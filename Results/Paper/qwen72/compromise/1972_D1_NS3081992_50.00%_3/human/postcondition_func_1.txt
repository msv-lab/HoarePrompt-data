The function `func_2` reads a line from the standard input (stdin), expecting it to contain two space-separated integers. It then converts these integers from strings to integers and returns a map object containing the two integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the two integers.
