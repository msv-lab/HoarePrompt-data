Output State: **The program returns -1.** 

This means the program explicitly returns the integer value -1, regardless of the initial values of `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. The conditions provided about `k` being less than 0 and the operations involving `a` and `m` do not affect the return value in this snippet.
