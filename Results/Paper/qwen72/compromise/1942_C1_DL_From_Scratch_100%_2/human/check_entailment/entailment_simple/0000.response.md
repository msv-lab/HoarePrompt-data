Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` should be defined to accept the parameters as specified in the problem description. However, the function is currently defined without any parameters. This is a mismatch with the problem requirements.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input and the list of chosen vertices.

3. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices**: The function sorts the list of chosen vertices, which is necessary to correctly identify the gaps between the chosen vertices.

4. **Counting Gaps of Size 1**: The function counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive chosen vertices. This is done correctly by iterating through the sorted list and checking the difference between adjacent elements.

5. **Handling the Wrap-Around Gap**: The function also correctly handles the wrap-around gap by calculating the difference between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the polygon's cyclic nature.

6. **Calculating the Number of Triangles**: The function calculates the number of triangles by adding the number of gaps of size 1 to `x - 2`. This is based on the idea that each chosen vertex can form a triangle with its adjacent vertices, and the number of such triangles is `x - 2` (since each triangle involves 3 vertices, and we need to avoid double-counting).

7. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

However, there is a critical issue with the function definition. The function should be defined with parameters to match the problem description. This is a significant error that affects the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the function, it should be defined as follows:

```python
def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    for _ in range(t):
        list0 = sorted(chosen_vertices)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
```

And the function should be called with the appropriate parameters:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    chosen_vertices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func(1, n, x, y, chosen_vertices)
```

This ensures that the function is correctly defined and called with the required parameters.
