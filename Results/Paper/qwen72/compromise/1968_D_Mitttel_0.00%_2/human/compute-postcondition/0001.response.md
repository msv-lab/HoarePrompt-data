Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.** 

This means that the variable `current_pos` now holds the same value as `start_pos`, which is a positive integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The value of `score` remains 0, and the conditions regarding `start_pos` and `n` are still valid.
