The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the state, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `testcases` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called, but its return value and any side effects are not specified.**
