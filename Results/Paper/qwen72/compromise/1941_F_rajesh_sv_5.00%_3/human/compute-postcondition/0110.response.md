Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` is no longer less than `h`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is equal to the final value of `l` (which is also `h`), `mid_sum` is equal to `D[l] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is either `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, or undefined if `l + 1` is out of bounds. The variables `ans` and `f` remain unchanged.**
