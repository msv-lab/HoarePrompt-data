Postcondition: ***`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` is no longer less than `h`, `mid` is equal to the final value of `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[l] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is either `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, or undefined if `l + 1` is out of bounds. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
