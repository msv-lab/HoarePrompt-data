Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `index` remains 2 or None depending on the previous state.**
