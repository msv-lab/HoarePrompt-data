Output State: **`l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain the same, and the condition regarding the differences between `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_next_sum` is still valid.
