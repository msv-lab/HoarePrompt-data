Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', and the first character is '.'. For each iteration of the loop, the variable `ret` will contain the number of '@' characters encountered before the first occurrence of two consecutive '*' characters, and `thorn` will be 0 or 1 depending on whether a single '*' has been encountered or not. The loop will print the value of `ret` for each test case.**
