The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it is mentioned that `1 <= t <= 1000`, which suggests that `t` could be the input that determines the number of iterations. However, since the input is not explicitly tied to `t`, we cannot assume this. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`_` is not relevant, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
