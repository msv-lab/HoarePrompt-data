You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7.
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        
        list1 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = input('')
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        list1.sort()
        
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        
        out.append(sum(list2))
        
        del list1[:]
        
        del list2[:]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `list_of_lists` remains a list of lists where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7, `num` remains an input string, `out` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., integers from each sorted sublist of 2n integers read from the input, and the length of `out` is equal to the integer value of `num`.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The `out` list remains unchanged, and `t`, `list_of_lists`, and `num` also remain unchanged. The loop simply prints each element in the `out` list, but does not modify any of the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the input, sorts the list, and computes the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., integers from the sorted list. It then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, and the input lists remain unchanged. The `out` list contains the sums for each test case, and these sums are printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers to be processed.
   - It then reads a line of input containing `2a` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pick the smaller number from each pair. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pair Selection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list, selecting every second element (i.e., the smaller number in each pair) and appending it to `list2`. This is done by the loop `for i in range(a): list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))`.

4. **Summing and Storing Results:**
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is calculated and appended to the `out` list, which stores the results for each test case.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `out` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the smaller number in each pair by sorting the list and selecting every second element.
  - This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved because the smallest numbers are always chosen first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the constraints well, including the maximum number of test cases (5000) and the maximum number of integers per test case (100).
  - The program also correctly handles the input format and ensures that the list is cleared for each new test case.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(2n \log 2n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The subsequent loop to select pairs has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It will produce the correct output for the given inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
