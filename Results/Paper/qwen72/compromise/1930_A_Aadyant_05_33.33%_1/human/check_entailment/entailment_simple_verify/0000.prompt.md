You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7.
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        
        list1 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = input('')
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        list1.sort()
        
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        
        out.append(sum(list2))
        
        del list1[:]
        
        del list2[:]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `list_of_lists` remains a list of lists where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7, `num` remains an input string, `out` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., integers from each sorted sublist of 2n integers read from the input, and the length of `out` is equal to the integer value of `num`.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The `out` list remains unchanged, and `t`, `list_of_lists`, and `num` also remain unchanged. The loop simply prints each element in the `out` list, but does not modify any of the variables.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the selection of pairs from the sorted list. Specifically, the program always selects the first element of each pair in the sorted list, which is not always the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The expected output should be:
```
9
```

However, the program will output:
```
6
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
- The program sorts the list to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- It then selects the first element of each pair: `[1, 3, 5]`.
- The sum of these elements is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

But the program actually selects: `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always select the smallest two elements in each move. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible. The correct approach would be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for _ in range(int(num)):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().split()
        a = [int(x) for x in a]
        a.sort()
        out.append(sum(a[:n]))
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all potential cases and produce the expected output.
