Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def max_score(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7.**
