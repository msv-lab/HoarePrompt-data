Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the lengths of the two binary strings `a` and `b`, and then the strings themselves. The program then iterates through the characters of string `a` and tries to find a matching subsequence in string `b`. The variable `k` keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The program correctly handles the case where the end of string `b` is reached before a match is found for the current character in `a`, and it prints the value of `k` for each test case.

The program is efficient and works within the constraints provided, ensuring that it can handle up to \(10^4\) test cases and strings of lengths up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
