Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function works as intended:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and then reads the strings themselves.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. It also initializes `j` to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.
3. **Loop Through `a`**: The function iterates through each character in string `a` using a for loop.
4. **Find Matching Character in `b`**: For each character in `a`, it uses a while loop to find the next matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
5. **Update `k` and `j`**: If a matching character is found in `b`, it increments `k` by 1 and moves `j` to the next position in `b` to continue the search for the next character in `a`.
6. **Break if No Match**: If the end of `b` is reached without finding a match for the current character in `a`, the function breaks out of the loop.
7. **Print Result**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The function handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description, including:
- When `a` is a subsequence of `b` (e.g., `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`, output `3`).
- When `a` is not a subsequence of `b` (e.g., `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`, output `2`).
- When `b` does not contain any '1' (e.g., `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`, output `0`).

Given the execution summary, the function behaves as expected and produces the correct output for each test case.
