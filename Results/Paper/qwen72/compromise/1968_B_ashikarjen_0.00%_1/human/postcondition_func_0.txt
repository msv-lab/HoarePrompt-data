The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively, and then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input. It calculates the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the unchanged binary strings `a` and `b`, the unchanged lengths `n` and `m`, and the printed count `k`.
