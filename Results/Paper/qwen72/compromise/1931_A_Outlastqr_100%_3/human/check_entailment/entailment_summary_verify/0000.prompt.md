You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`. Based on the value of `n`, it constructs and prints a word according to the following rules: If `n` is greater than 52, the word is the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet string followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet string and then 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the resulting words for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sum of the positions of the letters is exactly 52. According to the logic in the program, if `n` is greater than 52, it assumes the word should be in the form of `Xzz` where `X` is a letter corresponding to the index `n - 53`. However, for `n = 52`, the correct output should be `azz` (since 1 + 26 + 25 = 52), but the program will incorrectly output `azz` as well, which is not the lexicographically smallest word. The correct output for `n = 52` should be `ayz` (1 + 25 + 26 = 52), which is lexicographically smaller than `azz`.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the sum of the positions is between 28 and 52 correctly. For example, for `n = 51`, the correct output should be `ayy` (1 + 25 + 25 = 51), but the program will output `azz` (1 + 26 + 24 = 51), which is not the lexicographically smallest word.
