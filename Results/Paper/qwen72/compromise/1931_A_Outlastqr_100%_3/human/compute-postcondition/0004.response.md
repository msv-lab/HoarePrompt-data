Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`. Based on the value of `n`, it constructs and prints a word according to the following rules: If `n` is greater than 52, the word is the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet string followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet string and then 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the resulting words for each test case. **
