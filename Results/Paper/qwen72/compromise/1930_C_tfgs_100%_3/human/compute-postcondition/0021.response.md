Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` must be greater than `j`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- After executing the code, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
