The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `adv`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `adv` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` must be greater than `j`**
