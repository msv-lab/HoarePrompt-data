Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is `counter[a[i]]` or `0 - adv + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` or `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element being `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `adv - 1` and now also contains `a[i]`. If `i > 0`, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended: the elements are `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `cur` is `cur - adv`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `ans`.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` already contains `adv` elements, and now it also contains `a[i]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
