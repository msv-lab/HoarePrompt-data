Output State: **`adv` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended: the elements are `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is decremented by `adv`.
- The other variables (`adv`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, but their values and relationships are still valid as described in the initial state.
