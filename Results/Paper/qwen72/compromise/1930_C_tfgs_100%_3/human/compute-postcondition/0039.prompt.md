Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is `counter[a[i]]` or `0 - adv + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` or `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element being `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `adv - 1` and now also contains `a[i]`, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `j` is `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, and `adv` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1` if `i > 0`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `ans` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `ans` has two new elements appended: the first element is `a[i - 1] - 1`, and the second element is `a[i - 1] - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `adv` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `ans` has three new elements appended: the first element is `a[i - 1] - 1`, the second element is `a[i - 1] - 2`, and the third element is `a[i - 1] - 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
