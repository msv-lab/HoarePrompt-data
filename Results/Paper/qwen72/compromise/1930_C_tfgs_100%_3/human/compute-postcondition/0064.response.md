The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`. The loop can execute again if `cnt` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1 to ensure it still meets the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, with the last element being `ans[-2] - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` is greater than 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is decremented by 1**
