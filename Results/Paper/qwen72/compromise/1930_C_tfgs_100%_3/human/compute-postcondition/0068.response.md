Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, with the last `cnt` elements being a decreasing sequence starting from `ans[-cnt-1] - 1` and ending at `ans[-1]` which is `ans[-cnt-1] - cnt`, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The list `ans` now contains all elements from the initial list `a` plus additional elements that were added to fill the gap up to `n` elements. The last `cnt` elements of `ans` form a decreasing sequence, where the first element of this sequence is `ans[-cnt-1] - 1` and the last element is `ans[-cnt-1] - cnt`.
- The `counter` object still has all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0.
- The variable `cnt` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `cur` remains 0.
