Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and the list `a` is now sorted in descending order.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`.
- Since `n` is the length of the list `a`, `len(a)` is equal to `n`.
- Therefore, `cnt` is `n - n`, which simplifies to `0`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
