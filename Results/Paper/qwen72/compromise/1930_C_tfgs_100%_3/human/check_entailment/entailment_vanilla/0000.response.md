### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`. This step is correct because it aligns with the problem's requirement to insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct because the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and the final array `b` should be sorted in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs `ans` by adding elements and ensuring that the array is lexicographically largest.
   - The `cur` variable keeps track of the number of elements that can be added to `ans` without violating the uniqueness constraint.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the remaining number of elements to be added to `ans` to reach the length `n`.

5. **Handling Duplicates and Gaps:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are duplicates in the modified array `a` by using the `Counter` and ensuring that the elements are added in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
   - It fills in the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted array to ensure that the final array `b` is as large as possible.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the set `S` contains unique elements, sorts them in descending order, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by filling in gaps and handling duplicates appropriately.

However, there is a minor issue in the function `func_1` where it is called inside the loop but not defined before the loop. This should be fixed by defining `func_1` before the loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
