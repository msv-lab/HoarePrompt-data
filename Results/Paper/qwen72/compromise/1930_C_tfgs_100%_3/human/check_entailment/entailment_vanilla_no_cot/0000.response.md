Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates**: The program attempts to handle duplicates by using a `Counter` and adjusting the `cur` and `cnt` variables, but this approach is flawed. The problem requires that the set `S` only contains unique elements, and the program should focus on generating the lexicographically largest array `b` by carefully selecting the indices `i` during the operations.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Lexicographically Largest Array**: The program sorts the array `a` after modifying its elements and then tries to construct the array `b` by filling in gaps. However, this logic does not ensure that the array `b` is lexicographically largest. The correct approach involves a more strategic selection of indices `i` to maximize the values inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Incorrect Output for Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It calls `func_1()` inside a loop for each test case, but the function itself does not reset any state or variables, which could lead to incorrect results if the state from one test case affects another.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we insert the largest possible values into the set `S` in each operation. This can be achieved by always selecting the last element of the array `a` and inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`. After each operation, the last element is removed, and the process is repeated until the array `a` is empty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[-1] + (n - i))
        a.pop()
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case individually.
2. **Operation Loop**: For each test case, read the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. **Set Insertion**: Iterate from `0` to `n-1` and in each iteration, select the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[-1]`), add `a[-1] + (n - i)` to the set `S`, and remove the last element from `a`.
4. **Sorting and Output**: After all operations, sort the set `S` in descending order to get the lexicographically largest array `b` and print the elements of `b`.

This approach ensures that we always insert the largest possible values into the set `S`, which is necessary to construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.
