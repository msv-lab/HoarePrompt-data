### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is in line with the problem description.

3. **Set and Counter Usage:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements in descending order.

4. **Generating the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final result.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - It also fills any gaps up to `n` elements by adding the largest possible numbers that are not already in `ans`.

5. **Gap Filling:**
   - The program uses the `counter` to keep track of how many times each element was originally in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of additional elements needed (`cnt`) and ensures that these elements are added in a way that maintains the lexicographical order.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the required output format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step-by-Step Operation:**
  - The program correctly performs the three-step operation described in the problem:
    1. Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
    2. Insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.
    3. Delete `a[i]` from `a`.

- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - The program ensures that the final array `b` is lexicographically largest by:
    - Sorting the unique elements of `a` in descending order.
    - Filling any gaps with the largest possible numbers that are not already in `ans`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when all elements in `a` are the same or when `a` contains a large range of values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the problem description. It handles all the required steps and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
