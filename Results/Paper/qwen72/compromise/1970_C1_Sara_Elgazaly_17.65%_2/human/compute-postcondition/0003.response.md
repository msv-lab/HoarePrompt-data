The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The initial state variables `x` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input.**
