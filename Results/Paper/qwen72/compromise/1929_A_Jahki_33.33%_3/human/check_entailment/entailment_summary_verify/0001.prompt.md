You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `num2`. It checks if the elements in the list `a` are in strictly increasing order up to the index `num2 - 1`. If all elements from index 0 to `num2 - 2` are strictly less than the next element, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - It converts the input string into a list of integers using a list comprehension and the `isdigit()` method to filter out non-digit characters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If the array is already sorted (as determined by `func_1`), the program prints 0 because the beauty of a sorted array is 0.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty of the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Objective:**
  - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these minimized differences will be maximized.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, the beauty is 0, and the program prints 0.
  - However, this check is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, regardless of whether the array was initially sorted or not.

- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
  - This approach is correct and will always yield the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in terms of logic and implementation. However, the `func_1` function is redundant and can be removed to simplify the code. The main logic of sorting the array and calculating the beauty is correct and will produce the desired output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
