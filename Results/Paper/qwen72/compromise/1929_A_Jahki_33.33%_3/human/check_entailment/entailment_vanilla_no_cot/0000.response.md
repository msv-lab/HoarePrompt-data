Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues:

1. **Logic for `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it only counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the previous element. If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the function should return `True` if the count of such occurrences is `num2 - 1` (since there are `num2 - 1` pairs to check). The current implementation returns `True` if the array is sorted in non-increasing order, which is incorrect.

2. **Calculation of Beauty**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the problem requires the maximum beauty, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences. The current implementation sorts the array correctly but calculates the beauty using the sorted array, which is not necessarily the maximum beauty.

3. **Output for Sorted Arrays**: The program prints `0` if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is incorrect. The maximum beauty should be calculated for all arrays, regardless of their initial order.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Sort the array to maximize the beauty
    b = sorted(a)
    
    # Calculate the beauty
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version always sorts the array and calculates the beauty, ensuring the maximum possible beauty is printed for each test case.
