### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `a` itself.
   - The array `a` is parsed correctly from the input string.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is in strictly increasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is strictly increasing (i.e., `order == 0`), it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because a strictly increasing array has no positive differences between consecutive elements.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty of the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, thus maximizing the beauty.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which is the correct output based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, checks if the array is strictly increasing, and calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
