The loop head involves the variables `i` and `num2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `num2` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `num2` must be greater than 3.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is 3, `num2` must be greater than 3, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` is 1. Otherwise, if `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]`, `order` is 2.**
