Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is `num2 - 1`, `order` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than or equal to the next element in the list from index 0 to `num2 - 2`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `num2` remains the same, representing the number of test cases.
- The variable `i` will be `num2 - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `num2 - 1`.
- The variable `order` will be the count of how many times an element in the list `a` was greater than or equal to the next element in the list, starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element of the list.
