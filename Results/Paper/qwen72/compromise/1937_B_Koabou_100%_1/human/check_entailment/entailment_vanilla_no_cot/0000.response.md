Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string. It only considers a single transition from the top row to the bottom row, which is not sufficient to find the smallest string. The grasshopper can make multiple transitions, and the program should account for all possible transitions to find the smallest string.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting**:
   - The program's logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper can transition multiple times between the top and bottom rows.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The `print(s, sep='')` statement is incorrect. The `sep` parameter is used to specify the separator between multiple items being printed, not to control the output format of a single string. The correct way to print the string is simply `print(s)`.

4. **Variable Usage**:
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of paths, but its calculation is incorrect. The program should count the number of valid paths that yield the smallest string, which involves more complex logic than what is currently implemented.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - Traverse the grid from the top-left to the bottom-right, always choosing the path that gives the smallest possible value at each step. This involves comparing the values in the top and bottom rows at each column and choosing the smaller one.

2. **Count the Number of Paths**:
   - Keep track of the number of valid paths that yield the smallest string. This involves counting the number of ways to transition between the top and bottom rows while maintaining the lexicographically smallest string.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a1 = input()
    a2 = input()
    
    # Initialize the smallest string and the number of paths
    smallest_string = []
    paths = 1
    
    # Start from the top-left cell
    smallest_string.append(a1[0])
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a1[i] < a2[i]:
            smallest_string.append(a1[i])
            if a2[i-1] == '0':
                paths += 1
        else:
            smallest_string.append(a2[i])
            if a1[i-1] == '1':
                paths = 1
    
    # Add the last cell of the bottom row
    smallest_string.append(a2[-1])
    
    # Print the results
    print(''.join(smallest_string))
    print(paths)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string.
