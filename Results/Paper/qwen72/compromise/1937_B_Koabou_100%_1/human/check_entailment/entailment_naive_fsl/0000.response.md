Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved by multiple paths, especially when the grid allows for more complex scenarios. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0000
0000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
00000
1
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. In this case, there are two valid paths that both yield the string "00000":

1. Path 1: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4)
2. Path 2: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

The program, however, only counts one path. This indicates a flaw in the logic used to count the number of paths. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
