### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - The array \(a\) is then sorted.
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is a key step because it ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized when the elements are paired in this manner.
   - By sorting, the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, which maximizes the positive differences.

4. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The program iterates through the first half of the sorted array and calculates the differences between the corresponding largest and smallest elements.
   - This is done by summing \(a[n-i-1] - a[i]\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\).

5. **Output**:
   - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., [69, 69, 69]) correctly, as the beauty will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements correctly, as it only iterates up to the middle of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. The approach is sound and the implementation matches the problem description.
