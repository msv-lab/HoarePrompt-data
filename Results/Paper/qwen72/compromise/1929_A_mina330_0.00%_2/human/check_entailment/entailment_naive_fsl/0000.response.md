Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for all potential cases. Specifically, the program is only summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is because the beauty is defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), and sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
The sorted array is \([1, 2, 3, 4]\). The maximum beauty should be:
\[
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]
However, the given program will output:
\[
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4
\]
which is incorrect.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += a[i] - a[i-1]
        print(kq)
```
