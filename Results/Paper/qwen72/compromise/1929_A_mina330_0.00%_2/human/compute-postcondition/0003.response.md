The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 500), `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
