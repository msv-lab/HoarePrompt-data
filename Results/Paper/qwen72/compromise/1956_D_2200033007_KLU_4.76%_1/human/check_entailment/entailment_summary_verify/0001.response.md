Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the space-separated integers from the input, converts them to a list of integers, and stores them in the list `a`. This part of the code is accurate and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is a valid function call.

3. **Function Definition and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which represents the length of the array.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the function.
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the elements of the array will always be 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible inputs. The correct approach should consider the actual elements of the array and compute the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

4. **Output**:
   - The program only handles the case where the array length is 2 correctly.
   - For all other lengths, it incorrectly outputs `13 0`, which is not a valid solution for the problem. For example, in the third example, the correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`, but the program would output `13 0`.

5. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic for finding the MEX and applying the operations is missing entirely.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not follow the required logic to solve the problem for arrays of any length.

Final: **False**
