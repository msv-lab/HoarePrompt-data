### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - **Variable Mismatch**: The variable `k` is read but not used in the function, which suggests a mismatch in the function's parameters. The correct variable should be `m`.
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the function does not match the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic is simply adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`, which is not related to the problem's conditions.
   - **Missing GCD Calculation**: The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is essential for the problem.
   - **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - This requires a more complex algorithm, possibly involving iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` is not implementing the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
