Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.** 

The value of `l` is updated to a new input integer, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now `l-1`, and `x` and `y` still represent the maximum and minimum values in `nums`, respectively.
