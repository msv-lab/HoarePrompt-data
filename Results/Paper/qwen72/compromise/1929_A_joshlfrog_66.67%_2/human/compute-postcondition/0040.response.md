The value of `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `y` is now assigned the value of `nums[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is `nums[1]`, `x` is `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` > 0 and `nums[1]` > `x`, otherwise `x` remains 0 if `nums[1]` <= 0 or `nums[1]` <= `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is `nums[1]`, `x` is `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` > 0 and `nums[1]` > `x`, otherwise `x` remains 0 if `nums[1]` <= 0 or `nums[1]` <= `x`.**
