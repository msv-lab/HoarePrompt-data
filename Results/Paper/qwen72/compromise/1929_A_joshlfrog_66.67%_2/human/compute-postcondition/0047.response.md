Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 500, `e` remains 1, `l` remains the input integer representing the length of the list `nums`, and `nums` remains the list of integers input by the user. The variable `i` will be `l-1`, which is the last index of the list `nums`. The variable `x` will be updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` will be updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums`. If the list `nums` is empty, `x` will remain 0 and `y` will remain 100000000.
