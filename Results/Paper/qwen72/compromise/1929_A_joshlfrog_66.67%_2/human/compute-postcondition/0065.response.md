Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[1]` < `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]` and `x` is either 0, `nums[0]`, or `nums[1]` based on the initial conditions. Otherwise, `y` remains the value it had after the initial condition (100000000 or `nums[0]`), and `x` is either 0, `nums[0]`, or `nums[1]` based on the initial conditions.***
