Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `y` is set to the value of `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than 100000000. `x` is 0 if `nums[0]` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]`.***
