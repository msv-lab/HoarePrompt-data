Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

The value of `x` is updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `x` was the maximum value in `nums`, but after the code execution, `x` is now 0. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state.
