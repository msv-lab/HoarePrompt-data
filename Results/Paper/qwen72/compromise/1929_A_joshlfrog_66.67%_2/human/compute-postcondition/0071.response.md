Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The variable `e` remains 2.
- The variable `l` is the length of the list `nums`, which is the new input integer.
- The variable `nums` is the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `i` is `l-1`, meaning it has iterated through all elements of the list `nums`.
- The variable `x` is updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums` after all iterations.
- The variable `y` is updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums` after all iterations.
