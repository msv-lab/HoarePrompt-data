The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
