Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of the loop by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next one. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain valid.
