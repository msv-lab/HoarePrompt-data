Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is 2, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive characters from the start of `num` that are equal to their respective next characters, and if all characters in `num` from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal to their respective next characters, `cn` is `n - 1` and `j` is the index where the first inequality was found. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
