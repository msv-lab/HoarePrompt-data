Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is 0. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
