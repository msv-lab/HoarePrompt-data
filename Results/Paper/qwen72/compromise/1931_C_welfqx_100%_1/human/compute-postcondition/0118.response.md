The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `ii` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2, but since `ii` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
