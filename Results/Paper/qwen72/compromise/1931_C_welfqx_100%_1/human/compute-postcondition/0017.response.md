Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is 2. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
