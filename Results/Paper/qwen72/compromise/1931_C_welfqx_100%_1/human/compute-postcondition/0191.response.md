The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in the function signature. Based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the array, and an array `a` containing `n` integers. The function is expected to process these inputs and return some output based on the given constraints.

However, since the actual output is not specified in the provided information, I will describe the parameters and the expected behavior based on the constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the size of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= n). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is implied to be based on the contents of the array `a` for each test case.**
