Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 0, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
