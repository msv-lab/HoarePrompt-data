Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `cn` being 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `cn`). Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
