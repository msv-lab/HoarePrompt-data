Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
- The values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num` is still valid and has led to the execution of the `break` statement.
