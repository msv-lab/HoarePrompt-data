Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`f`**: The value of `f` is initially 1. If any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are not equal, `f` is set to 0 and the loop breaks. If all elements in `num` are equal, `f` remains 1.
- **`num`**: The list `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`j`**: The value of `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking. If the loop breaks, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.
