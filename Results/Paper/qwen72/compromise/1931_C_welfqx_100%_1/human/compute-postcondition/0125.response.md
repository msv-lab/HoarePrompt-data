Postcondition: ***`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. If the loop breaks, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start up to `ii`.***
