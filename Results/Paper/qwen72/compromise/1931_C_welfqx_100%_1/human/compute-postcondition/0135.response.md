Postcondition: ***`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
