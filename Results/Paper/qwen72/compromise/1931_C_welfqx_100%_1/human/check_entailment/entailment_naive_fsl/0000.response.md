Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle a specific edge case where the array has multiple distinct elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the start or end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The program will output `3` because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the same value. However, the optimal solution is to select `x = 2` and apply the operation to the entire array, which would cost `5` burles. The correct output should be `3` (by selecting `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`), but the program does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
