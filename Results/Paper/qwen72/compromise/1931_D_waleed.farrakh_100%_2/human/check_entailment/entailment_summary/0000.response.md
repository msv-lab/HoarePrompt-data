### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases `t`, and then for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It constructs a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - This part of the function correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes the list of tuples `test_cases` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `ry = a % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases using `func_1`, `func_2` prints the results to the standard output.
   - This part of the function correctly handles the output format as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

- The function `func_1` correctly calculates:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which is equivalent to \(-a_i \mod x\). This ensures that when we find another element `b` such that `b % x` matches `rx`, \(a_i + b\) will be divisible by \(x\).
  - `ry = a % y` which is equivalent to \(a_i \mod y\). This ensures that when we find another element `b` such that `b % y` matches `ry`, \(a_i - b\) will be divisible by \(y\).

- The function `func_1` correctly counts the pairs that satisfy both conditions by using the `freq` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and checking if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input, applies the logic to find beautiful pairs, and outputs the results in the expected format. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
