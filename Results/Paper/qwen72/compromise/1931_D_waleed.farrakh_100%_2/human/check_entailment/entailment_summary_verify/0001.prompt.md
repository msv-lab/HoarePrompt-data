You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. It processes these test cases by calling another function `func_1` and prints the results of each test case. After the function concludes, the program has read and processed `t` test cases, and the results of these test cases have been printed to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines: the first line contains `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains the array `arr`.
   - It appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count`.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list and returns the list of results.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The use of `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the correct remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, which is necessary for the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
   - The use of `ry = a % y` ensures that `ry` is the correct remainder when `a` is divided by `y`, which is necessary for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the number of elements that have the same remainders, which allows for efficient counting of beautiful pairs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the maximum number of test cases and the maximum size of the array.
   - It correctly handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs (e.g., the second test case in the example).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints, as it processes each element in the array only once and uses a dictionary for constant-time lookups.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
