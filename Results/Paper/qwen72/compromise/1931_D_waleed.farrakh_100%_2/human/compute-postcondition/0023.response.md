The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(result)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `results` must be an iterable with at least one element.
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely that `result` is intended to be an element from the `results` iterable.

However, the code snippet is trying to print `result`, which is not defined. This will result in a `NameError` because `result` is not a known variable in the current scope.

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
