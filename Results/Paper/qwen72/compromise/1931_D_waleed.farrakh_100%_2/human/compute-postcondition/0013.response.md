The code appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the list `test_cases`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are derived from the string at `data[3]` and `data[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` and the new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[3]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[4]`.**
