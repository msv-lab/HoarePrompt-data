Output State: **`results` must be an iterable with at least `t` elements, and the loop will have printed all `t` elements of `results`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` iterable must have contained at least `t` elements, and each of these elements will have been printed to the console. The initial variables `data`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `idx` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
