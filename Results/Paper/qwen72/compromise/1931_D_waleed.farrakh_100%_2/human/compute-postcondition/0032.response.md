Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with the value 1, `count` is not affected.**

Explanation:
- The code `freq[current_pair] = 1` updates the dictionary `freq` to set the value of the key `current_pair` to 1.
- `current_pair` is defined as `(a % x, a % y)`, and this pair is now explicitly set in `freq` with a value of 1.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `results`, `rx`, `ry`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `freq` now includes the key `current_pair` with a value of 1.
