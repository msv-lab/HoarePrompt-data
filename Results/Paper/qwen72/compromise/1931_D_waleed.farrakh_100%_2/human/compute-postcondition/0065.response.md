Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 2), `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`, and `freq` contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1 or 2. If `(rx, ry)` was in `freq` before the if-else block executed, `count` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `current_pair` was already in `freq`.**
