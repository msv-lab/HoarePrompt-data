Initial State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[1]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[2]`.

Code:
```
n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
```

Impact of the code:
- The string at `data[3]` is split into parts, and each part is converted to an integer.
- The first part is assigned to `n`.
- The second part is assigned to `x`.
- The third part is assigned to `y`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[3]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[2]`.**
