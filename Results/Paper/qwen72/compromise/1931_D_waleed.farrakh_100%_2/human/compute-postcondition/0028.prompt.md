Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the corresponding parts of the strings at `data[1], data[3], ...`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from the strings at `data[2], data[4], ...`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`. `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` must be an iterable with at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` must be an iterable with at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the iterable

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must be an iterable with at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the iterable




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
