Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, and `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been found in `freq` before it was updated in the current iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `arr` list has been fully iterated over, and it contains `n` elements.
- The `results` list is still empty because it is not modified in the loop.
- The `freq` dictionary now contains the frequency count of each unique pair of `(a % x, a % y)` for every element `a` in `arr`.
- The `count` variable holds the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` was found in the `freq` dictionary before it was updated during the current iteration of the loop.
