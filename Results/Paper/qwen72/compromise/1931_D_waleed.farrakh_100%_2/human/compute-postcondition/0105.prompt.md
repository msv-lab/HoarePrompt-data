Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, and `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its value remains 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the second element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1 if `current_pair` was not originally in `freq`, and with the value 2 if `current_pair` was originally in `freq`. `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `results` is a list containing the value 0. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq` includes the key `current_pair` with the value 2, and `count` is 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 0. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1, and `count` is 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
