Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is a tuple containing the values `a % x` and `a % y`) is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with the value 1. `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with the value 1 if `current_pair` was not already in `freq`, or `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
