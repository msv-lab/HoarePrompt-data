The only object in the loop head is the variable `a` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. Given the initial state, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases`), and `n` is at least 1 (since `test_cases` has at least 2 tuples and the second tuple contains `n`).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` has at least one element, and `a` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`**
