Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 2), `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is 0, and `freq` contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1 or 2 depending on whether `current_pair` was already in `freq` before the if-else block executed.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` updates the value of `rx`.
- `rx` is now calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `count`, and `freq` remain unchanged.
- The initial state information that was not affected by the code snippet is still valid.
