To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the context, `n` is the integer value of the first line of the current test case, and it is specified that `n` should be between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is within the valid range and that the loop counter `_` starts at 0.

State: **`n` must be an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `_` is 0**
