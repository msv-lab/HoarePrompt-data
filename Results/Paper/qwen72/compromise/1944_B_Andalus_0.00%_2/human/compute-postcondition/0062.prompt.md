Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this update, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to `sz + 2`. If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
