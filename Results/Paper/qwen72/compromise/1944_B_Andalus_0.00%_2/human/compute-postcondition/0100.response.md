Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, `sz` is `sz + 2`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.**
