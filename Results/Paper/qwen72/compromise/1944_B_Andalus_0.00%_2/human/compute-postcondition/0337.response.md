Based on the initial state provided:

- `rdb` must have at least three elements.
- `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify `elem`**:
   - According to the precondition, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` has at least three elements, `elem` is a valid element in the list.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Output**:
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but we know it is the third element in `rdb`.
   - The `print` statement will output `elem` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the third element in the list `rdb`)**
