Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is unchanged, `elem` is undefined, `_` is `T`. `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will have the value `n - 1`.
- The variable `n` will remain unchanged.
- The variables `ldb`, `sng`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sz`, `elem`, and `_` will all remain in their initial states.
- The list `rdb` will contain all elements from the list `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element and including all such elements up to the last element in `rgt`.
