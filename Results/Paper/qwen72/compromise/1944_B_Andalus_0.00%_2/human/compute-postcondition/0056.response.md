The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `ldb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.**
