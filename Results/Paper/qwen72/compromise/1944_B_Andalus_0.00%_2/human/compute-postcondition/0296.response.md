Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` must have at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
