The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lft` is appended to `ldb`. The value of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ldb` contains the element at index 2 of `lft`.**
