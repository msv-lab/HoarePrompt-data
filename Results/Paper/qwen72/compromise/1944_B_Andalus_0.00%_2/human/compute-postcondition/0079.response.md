Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, followed by as many elements from `sng` as needed to reach a total of `k` elements printed, separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` still contains all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
- The variable `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, and then it has printed as many elements from `sng` as needed to reach a total of `k` elements printed, also separated by spaces. If `sz` reaches or exceeds `k` at any point, the loop breaks.
