Output State: **`sz` is `sz + n`, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + n)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least `n` elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop is exited.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `sz` will have increased by the number of elements processed in the loop (`n`), and `elem` will be the last element from `sng` that was processed before the loop either completed or broke due to `sz` reaching or exceeding `k`. The condition that `rdb` must have enough elements to satisfy `sz < k` before the loop breaks remains unchanged, and `sng` must have at least `n` elements for the loop to execute `n` times. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` at any point, the loop will break, and no further elements from `sng` will be processed.
