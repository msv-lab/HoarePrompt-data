To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `ldb`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least one element
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
- `k` is unchanged
- `lst` is unchanged
- `lft` is unchanged
- `rgt` is unchanged
- `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0
- `elem` is the first element in `ldb`
- `_` is `T`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`
- The loop will execute again if `ldb` has more than one element, and `elem` will be the next element in `ldb`.

Since `elem` is the first element in `ldb` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `elem` must be the second element in `ldb` at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `ldb` must have at least two elements.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.**
