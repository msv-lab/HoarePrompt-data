Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is a list containing `lft[2]`. `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the value `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`.
- Since `i` is 2, `ldb` now contains the value `lft[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
