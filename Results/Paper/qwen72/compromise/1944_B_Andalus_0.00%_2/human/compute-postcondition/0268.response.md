To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate values from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 1, and `n` should be greater than 1. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state do not affect the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
