Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `ldb` must have at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2.
   - If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is printing the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element in the list `ldb`.
   - Since `ldb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is guaranteed to be a valid element in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `elem` will be printed twice, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the third element in the list `ldb`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the third element in the list `ldb`)**
