Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` if `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the value of `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 3.
- The value of `n` must be greater than 3.
- The value of `k` is an input integer.
- The value of `ldb` is determined by the condition `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`. If this condition is true, `ldb` contains the second element of `lft`; otherwise, `ldb` remains an empty list.
- The value of `sng` is initially determined by the condition `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`. If this condition is true, `sng` contains the value of `lft[2]`. After the code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` is executed, `sng` will contain the value of `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`.
- The value of `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- The value of `_` is `T + 1`.
- The value of `rdb` is an empty list.
- The value of `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
- The value of `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
- The value of `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- The value of `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
