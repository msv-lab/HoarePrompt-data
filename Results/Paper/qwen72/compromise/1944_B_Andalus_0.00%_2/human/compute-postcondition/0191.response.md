To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables and objects involved. Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This means `i` is the last index of the list `lft` if `lft` has `n` elements.
2. **`n` is unchanged**: The total number of elements in `lft` remains `n`.
3. **`ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element**: This list `ldb` is populated with elements from `lft` that are the same as their preceding element.
4. **`sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 2 elements**: This list `sng` is populated with elements from `lft` that are unique in their immediate neighborhood and must have at least 2 elements.
5. **`k` is unchanged**: The value of `k` remains the same.
6. **`lst` is unchanged**: The list `lst` remains the same.
7. **`lft` is unchanged**: The list `lft` remains the same.
8. **`rgt` is unchanged**: The list `rgt` remains the same.
9. **`sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, plus 1**: This means `sz` is calculated based on the smaller of two values: the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k`, or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, plus 1.
10. **`_` is `T`**: This variable `_` is set to `T`, which is likely a boolean value (True).
11. **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`**: This list `rdb` is populated with elements from `rgt` that are the same as their preceding element, starting from the second element.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet. This suggests that `elem` is part of a loop or context that is not provided in the snippet.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be printed on the same line with a space separating each element.

### Possible Context:
- Given the initial state, it is likely that `elem` is being printed from a loop that iterates over one of the lists (`lft`, `sng`, `ldb`, `lst`, `rgt`, or `rdb`).
- However, without the loop context, we cannot determine the exact elements that will be printed.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact context of the loop or the value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the possible values of `elem` from the lists mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **[elem] (where [elem] is the value of `elem` from the list being iterated over in the context of the loop)**

If you can provide the loop context or the list from which `elem` is being printed, I can give a more precise output.
