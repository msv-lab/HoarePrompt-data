Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer.
2. `k` is an input integer.
3. `ldb` must have at least two elements.
4. `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
5. `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
6. `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
7. `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
8. `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
9. `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
10. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and List Initialization:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `n` is an input integer, and `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - `k` is another input integer.

2. **List Slicing and Sorting:**
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.

3. **List `sng` and `rdb` Construction:**
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.

4. **List `ldb` and `elem` Determination:**
   - `ldb` must have at least two elements. The exact elements of `ldb` are not specified, but it is assumed to be constructed from some elements of `lst`.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Output:
- Since `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, we can assume `ldb` has at least three elements.
- The value of `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the third element of `ldb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list ldb)**
