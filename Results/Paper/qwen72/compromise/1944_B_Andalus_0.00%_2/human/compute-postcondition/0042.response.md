The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts does not ensure that `ldb` has elements, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `ldb` has at least one element.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`**
