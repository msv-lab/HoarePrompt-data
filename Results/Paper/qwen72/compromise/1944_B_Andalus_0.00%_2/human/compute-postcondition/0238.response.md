Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial value of `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `n`, `ldb`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- `sz` is updated to the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb`, plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop either broke or completed its iterations.
