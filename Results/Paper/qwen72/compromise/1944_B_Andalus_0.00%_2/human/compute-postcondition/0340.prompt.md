Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`rdb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after the increase, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this update, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
