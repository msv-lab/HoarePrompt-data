Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 0, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block it is inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and conditions.
