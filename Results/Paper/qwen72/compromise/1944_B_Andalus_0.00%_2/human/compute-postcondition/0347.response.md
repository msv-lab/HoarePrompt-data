The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least 1 element, and `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `sng`.

State: **`sz` is `sz + 1`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 2 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is exited.**
