To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2` and 0 otherwise
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` must contain at least two elements
   - `elem` is the second-to-last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` is less than `k` and no loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The variable `elem` is the second-to-last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
   - The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (`end=' '`).

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `elem` is the second-to-last element in `rdb`, we need to identify this element.
   - The `print` statement will output `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second-to-last element in the `rdb` list that was processed before the loop broke or finished)**
