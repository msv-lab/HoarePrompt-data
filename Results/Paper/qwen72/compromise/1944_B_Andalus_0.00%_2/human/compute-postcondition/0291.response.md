To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `ldb` must have at least one element.
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided as input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, also sorted in ascending order.
   - `sng` is a list derived from `lft` containing elements that are not equal to their immediate neighbors (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
   - `rdb` is a list derived from `rgt` containing elements that are equal to their previous element.
   - `ldb` is a list that must have at least one element, but its exact content is not specified in the initial state.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
   - This will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

4. **Determining the Value of `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
   - Since `ldb` must have at least one element, it is guaranteed to have a second element if `ldb` has at least two elements.
   - However, the exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state. We can only describe it based on the information given.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we describe it as the second element in `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in ldb)**
