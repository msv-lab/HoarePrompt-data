Output State: **`rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, `sz` is increased by 2, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `k - sz` is now greater than or equal to 0.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, and the condition that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 is no longer necessarily true, as it is now greater than or equal to 0. The other conditions remain unchanged.
