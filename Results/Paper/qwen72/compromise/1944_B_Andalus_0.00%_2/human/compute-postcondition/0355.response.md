Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sz` is defined as `sz + 2`. This implies that `sz` is being incremented by 2 in some context.
   - `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. Since `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is a well-defined value.
   - `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks. This means that `rdb` has a sufficient number of elements to ensure the loop continues until `sz` is no longer less than `k`.
   - `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `k` is at least 2 more than the current value of `sz`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` with a space as the end character.
   - `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. Since `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is a well-defined value.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the third element in the list `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the third element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
