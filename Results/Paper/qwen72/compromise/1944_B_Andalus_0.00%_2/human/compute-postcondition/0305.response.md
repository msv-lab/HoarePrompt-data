To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)`.
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
   - `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

3. **Determining the Value of `elem`:**
   - Since `sng` must have at least 1 element, `elem` will be the first element in `sng`.
   - `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in the sense that they are not equal to their previous or next element in the sorted list `lft`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element in `sng` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the first element in the list `sng`, which is a list of unique elements from the sorted list `lft`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list sng, and sng contains all elements from lft that are not equal to their previous or next element, excluding the first and last elements of lft)**
