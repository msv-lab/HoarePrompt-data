The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element), the loop will execute. The state `i` is `n - 1` and `sz` is 0 are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. The state regarding the printing of elements from `ldb` and `sng` is also not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `rdb` must have at least one element, and `elem` will be the first element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`**
