Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 1 element, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 1, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 2 elements, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 2, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 3 elements, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 3, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
