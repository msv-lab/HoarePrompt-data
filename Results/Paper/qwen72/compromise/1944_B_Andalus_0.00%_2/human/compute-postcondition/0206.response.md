Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is 0
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` must contain at least one element
   - `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is described as the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
   - Since `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next elements, `elem` will be one of these elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state, but it is known to be the last element in `sng` that was processed.
   - Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished)**
