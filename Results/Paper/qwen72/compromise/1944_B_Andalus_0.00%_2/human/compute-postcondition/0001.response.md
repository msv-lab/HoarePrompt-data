The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `T`. The loop will execute `T` times, so for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop is executed a certain number of times without using the loop index.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant for the loop to execute**
