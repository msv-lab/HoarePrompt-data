Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` and 2 otherwise, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second-to-last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` is less than `k` and no loop or if statement is broken out of.***
