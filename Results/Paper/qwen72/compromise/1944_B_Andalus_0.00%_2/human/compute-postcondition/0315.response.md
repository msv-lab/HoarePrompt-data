To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the first `n` elements of `lst`.

2. **`n` is an input integer**: `n` is the number of elements to be considered from the start of `lst` for the `lft` list.

3. **`k` is an input integer**: `k` is another input integer used in the calculation of `sz`.

4. **`ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element**: `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that are the same as the element immediately before them.

5. **`sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`)**: `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, not equal to the elements immediately before or after them.

6. **`rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element**: `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are the same as the element immediately before them.

7. **`lst` is a list of integers read from input**: `lst` is the original list of integers.

8. **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order**: `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements from `lst`.

9. **`rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order**: `rgt` is a sorted list of the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.

10. **`elem` is the third element in `sng`**: `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`.

11. **`sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2**: `sz` is calculated as the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb) + 2`.

12. **`sng` must have at least 3 elements**: This ensures that `sng` has at least 3 elements, so `elem` can be the third element.

13. **If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of**: This condition affects the flow of the program but doesn't directly impact the value of `elem`.

Given these conditions, the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `sng`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`lft` and `rgt` are created by sorting the first `n` elements and the remaining elements of `lst` respectively**.
2. **`ldb` is populated with elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element**.
3. **`rdb` is populated with elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element**.
4. **`sng` is populated with elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`)**.
5. **`elem` is the third element in `sng`**.
6. **`sz` is calculated as the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb) + 2`**.
7. **The condition `sz >= k` affects the program flow but not the value of `elem`**.

Since `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list `sng`)**
