Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sz` remains 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.***
