To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `k` is unchanged.
   - `lst` is unchanged.
   - `lft` is unchanged.
   - `rgt` is unchanged.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, plus 2.
   - `_` is `T`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.

2. **Focus on `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`.
   - `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element, and it must have at least 3 elements.

3. **Determine the value of `elem`:**
   - Since `sng` must have at least 3 elements, the third element in `sng` is well-defined.
   - The exact value of `elem` depends on the elements in `lft` that meet the criteria for inclusion in `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the third element in the list `sng`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list `sng`, and `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element, and must have at least 3 elements)**
