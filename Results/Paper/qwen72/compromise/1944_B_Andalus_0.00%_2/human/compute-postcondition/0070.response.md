Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
