The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block. If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` remains 0 and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.**
