Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Single Elements**: The program attempts to handle single elements in the `sng` list, but it does not correctly ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. The logic for appending single elements to `l` and `r` is flawed and may lead to incorrect results.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not always print the correct number of elements for `l` and `r`. It may print fewer than `2k` elements in some cases, which violates the problem's requirement.

3. **Logical Errors**: The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than 1. It only prints pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is exactly 1 or when the elements in `lft` and `rgt` are not well-distributed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. One way to do this is to use the property that the XOR of a number with itself is 0. Therefore, you can pair elements from the first half of the array with their corresponding elements in the second half of the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]
        rgt = lst[n:]
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of each element in the second half
        rgt_indices = {x: [] for x in set(rgt)}
        for i, x in enumerate(rgt):
            rgt_indices[x].append(i)
        
        # Initialize the result arrays
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Pair elements from the first half with elements from the second half
        for x in set(lft):
            if x in rgt_indices and len(rgt_indices[x]) >= 2:
                l.extend([x, x])
                r.extend([x, x])
                rgt_indices[x] = rgt_indices[x][2:]
                if len(l) == 2 * k:
                    break
            elif x in rgt_indices and len(rgt_indices[x]) == 1:
                l.append(x)
                r.append(x)
                rgt_indices[x] = []
                if len(l) == 2 * k:
                    break
        
        # Print the results
        print(*l)
        print(*r)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Dictionary for Indices**: We use a dictionary `rgt_indices` to store the indices of each element in the second half of the array. This helps us efficiently find and pair elements.
- **Pairing Elements**: We iterate through the unique elements in the first half of the array and try to pair them with elements in the second half. If an element appears at least twice in the second half, we add two instances of it to both `l` and `r`. If it appears exactly once, we add one instance to both `l` and `r`.
- **Breaking Condition**: We break the loop once we have collected `2k` elements in both `l` and `r`.
- **Output**: We print the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

This approach ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal and that the output format is correct.
