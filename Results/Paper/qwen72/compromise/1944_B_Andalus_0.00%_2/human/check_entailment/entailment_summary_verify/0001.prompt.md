You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It then prints up to `k` pairs of integers from the first half of the list and up to `k` pairs of integers from the second half of the list. The pairs are formed by consecutive duplicates in the sorted halves of the list, and any remaining single elements from the sorted halves. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input list `a` and the integer `k` are unchanged, but the internal state variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` used for processing are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List**:
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good approach because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements easily.

4. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The function iterates through `lft` to identify pairs of duplicate elements and single elements.
     - If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, it is a duplicate and is added to `ldb` (left duplicates).
     - If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]`, it is a single element and is added to `sng` (single elements).
   - Similarly, the function iterates through `rgt` to identify pairs of duplicate elements and adds them to `rdb` (right duplicates).

5. **Constructing the Output Arrays**:
   - The function constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing elements from `ldb` and `sng`:
     - For `l`, it prints pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` until it has printed `2k` elements.
     - If it still needs more elements, it prints single elements from `sng`.
     - The same process is repeated for `r` using `rdb`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function ensures that it does not print more than `2k` elements by using the `sz` variable to keep track of the number of elements printed.
   - The function handles the case where `k` is 1 by printing single elements if necessary.

7. **XOR Property**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is 0, so printing pairs of duplicate elements ensures that the XOR of these pairs is 0.
   - The XOR of a single element is the element itself, so if `k` is 1 and there are no pairs, the function prints a single element from `sng`.

8. **Guaranteed Solution**:
   - The problem guarantees that a solution always exists, and the function's approach of using pairs of duplicates and single elements ensures that it will always find a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies pairs of duplicate elements and single elements from the sorted halves of the input list. It then constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing the required number of elements to ensure the XOR condition is met. The program handles edge cases and guarantees a solution for each test case.
