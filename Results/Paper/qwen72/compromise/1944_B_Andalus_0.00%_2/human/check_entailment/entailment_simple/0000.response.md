### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `lst` of length `2n` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
   - It then splits `lst` into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This ensures that consecutive elements in these lists are either the same or different.

3. **Identifying Pairs and Singles:**
   - The program uses two lists, `ldb` and `rdb`, to store elements that appear consecutively in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
   - It also uses a list `sng` to store elements from `lft` that do not appear consecutively.

4. **Constructing the Output Arrays:**
   - The program constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing elements from `ldb` and `sng` in a way that ensures the XOR condition is met.
   - It prints pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` first, as these pairs will have the same XOR value.
   - If there are not enough pairs, it prints single elements from `sng` to meet the length requirement of `2k`.

5. **XOR Condition:**
   - The XOR condition is satisfied by printing pairs of the same elements from `ldb` and `rdb`, which have a XOR value of 0.
   - Single elements from `sng` are printed to ensure the length requirement, but the program does not guarantee that the XOR of these single elements will match between `l` and `r`.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the XOR of single elements from `sng` might not match between `l` and `r`.
   - The program does not ensure that the elements printed from `sng` are the same in both `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r` when using single elements from `sng`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
