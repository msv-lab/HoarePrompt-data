Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros except `p[2]` which is `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p[2]` is updated to `ind`, which is `n - 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged.
- The list `p` still has its first element as `n`, and the rest of the elements are zeros, except for the element at index 2, which is now `n - 2`.
