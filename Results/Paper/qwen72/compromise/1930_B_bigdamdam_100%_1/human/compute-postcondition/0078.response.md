Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `p` is a list of length `n` where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) is filled with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2. `ind` is the next even number after the last filled odd index.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000.
- For each iteration, the value of `n` is read from input, and a list `p` of length `n` is initialized with zeros.
- The first inner loop fills the even indices of `p` with values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
- The second inner loop fills the odd indices of `p` with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2.
- After all iterations, `p` is a list where even indices are filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and odd indices are filled with increasing values starting from 1 or 2.
- The variable `ind` is the next even number after the last filled odd index, but this value is not used further in the loop.
- The loop prints the list `p` after each iteration, but the final state of `p` is as described above.
