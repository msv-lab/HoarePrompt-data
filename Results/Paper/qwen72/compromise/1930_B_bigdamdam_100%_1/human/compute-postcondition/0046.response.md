Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2.**

Explanation:
- `ind` is incremented by 2, so the new value of `ind` is `ind + 2`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The values of `p[1]` and `p[3]` are still set to their respective expressions, but `ind` has been updated, so the expressions now reflect the new value of `ind`.
