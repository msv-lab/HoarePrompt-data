The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros.
- `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2, and specifically, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again with `i` set to 2.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`**
