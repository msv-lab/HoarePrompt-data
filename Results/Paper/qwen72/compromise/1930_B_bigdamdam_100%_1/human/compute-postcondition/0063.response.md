Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p[0]` is `ind - 4`, `p[2]` is `ind - 2`, `p[4]` is `ind - 2`, `ind` is `ind - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 4.
- The value of `n` must still be greater than 4.
- The value of `p[0]` remains `ind - 4`.
- The value of `p[2]` remains `ind - 2`.
- The value of `p[4]` is updated to `ind`, but since `ind` is `ind - 2`, `p[4]` is now `ind - 2`.
- The value of `ind` remains `ind - 2`.
