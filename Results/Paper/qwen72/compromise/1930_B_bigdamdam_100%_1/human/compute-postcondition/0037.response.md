Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p[2]` is now equal to `ind - 2`, `ind` is now `ind - 2`, `p[4]` is now equal to `ind`**

Explanation:
- The value of `p[i]` is updated to `ind`. Since `i` is 4, `p[4]` is now equal to `ind`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `p[2]`, and `ind` remain unchanged from their initial states.
