Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `p[0]` is `ind - 4`, `p[2]` is `ind - 2`, `ind` is `ind - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is decremented by 2.
- `p[0]` was initially `ind - 2`, and since `ind` is now `ind - 2`, `p[0]` becomes `ind - 4`.
- `p[2]` was initially `ind`, and since `ind` is now `ind - 2`, `p[2]` becomes `ind - 2`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
