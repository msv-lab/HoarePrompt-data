The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 to 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros except `p[2]` which is `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`.**
