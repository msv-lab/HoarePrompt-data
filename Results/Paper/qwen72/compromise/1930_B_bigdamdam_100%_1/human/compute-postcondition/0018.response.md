The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1, up to but not including `n`, and increments `i` by 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `p[i]` is `ind`, and `ind` is increased by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 from its last value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `p[i]` is `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 3**
