Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`) satisfy the conditions `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. The program constructs the permutation by placing the largest numbers at even indices and the smallest numbers at odd indices, which helps avoid the division conditions.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the integer `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the even indices with the largest numbers in descending order.
   - It fills the odd indices with the smallest numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 or 2 depending on whether `n` is odd or even.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

4. **Validation:**
   - The permutation is valid because:
     - The even indices contain the largest numbers, which are unlikely to divide any smaller number.
     - The odd indices contain the smallest numbers, which are unlikely to be divided by any larger number.
     - The specific pattern of filling ensures that no two adjacent numbers can satisfy the division conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest valid `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` (up to 10^5) correctly.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently constructs the permutation in O(n) time for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate a valid permutation for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
