Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. Specifically, when `n` is odd, the second loop that fills the odd indices starts with an incorrect value for `ind`. For example, if `n = 5`, the program will output `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, which is not a valid permutation according to the problem description. The issue arises because the second loop should start with `ind = 1` when `n` is odd, but it starts with `ind = 2` due to the expression `1 + n % 2`.

To fix this, the second loop should start with `ind = 1` for odd `n` and `ind = 2` for even `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)
```

This corrected version ensures that the permutation is valid for both even and odd values of `n`.
