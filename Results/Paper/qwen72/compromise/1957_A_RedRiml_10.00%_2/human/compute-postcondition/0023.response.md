Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the second element in `palka`). The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged. If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is now 1.**
