Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d` to an empty dictionary. This does not affect any other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` is now empty, and all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
