Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`). If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`). If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`. If `i` (the second element in `palka`) was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
