The code snippet `d[i] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d`, where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Since the initial state specifies that `d.get(i)` is `None`, indicating that `i` was not previously a key in `d`, this operation will create a new entry in `d`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i] = 1`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
