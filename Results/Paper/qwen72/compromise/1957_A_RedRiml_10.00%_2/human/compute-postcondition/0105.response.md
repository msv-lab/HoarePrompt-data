The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since `i` is the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value, and assuming `i` is already in `pl` (as per the initial state), the only change is in the value of `d[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least three elements, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`. The list `pl` now includes the integer `i` if it was not already present.**
