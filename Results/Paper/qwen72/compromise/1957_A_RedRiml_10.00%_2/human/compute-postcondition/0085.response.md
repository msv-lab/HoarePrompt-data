Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `pl = []` reassigns the variable `pl` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The dictionary `d` still contains the counts of elements from `palka`, and `shapes` is still determined based on the original `pl` before it was reset to an empty list.
