The code snippet `d[i] = 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the value associated with the key `i` to 1. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here's the detailed output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the second element in `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is 1.**
