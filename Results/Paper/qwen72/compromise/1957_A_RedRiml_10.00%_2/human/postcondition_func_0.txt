The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the standard input. Each set starts with an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `ln` representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of stick lengths. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the list for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function completes, the input variables `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` will have been modified according to the processing of the inputs, but their final states are not retained outside the function.
