Output State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance before the current character, the index of the current character, and the current character itself. The `balance` is 0 after the loop finishes, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. The length of `prefix_balance` is `n`, the same as the length of `s`.
