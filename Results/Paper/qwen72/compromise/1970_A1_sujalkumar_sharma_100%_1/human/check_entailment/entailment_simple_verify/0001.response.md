### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a good practice and ensures that the input is clean. The input is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, so this step is appropriate.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and for each character, it appends a tuple to `prefix_balance` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - The balance is updated based on whether the current character is an opening parenthesis `(` (balance increases by 1) or a closing parenthesis `)` (balance decreases by 1).
   - The final value of `balance` is 0, which is expected for a balanced parentheses sequence.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a lambda function that sorts the list first by the prefix balance in ascending order and then by the position in descending order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, it places characters with the same prefix balance in decreasing order of their positions, which is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - This step correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of the `func_1` function, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

### Verification:

- **Example Input**: `(()(()))`
  - **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
    - `prefix_balance` will be: `[(0, 0, '('), (1, 1, '('), (2, 2, ')'), (1, 3, '('), (2, 4, '('), (3, 5, ')'), (2, 6, ')'), (1, 7, ')')]`
  - **Sorting**:
    - After sorting, `prefix_balance` will be: `[(0, 0, '('), (1, 7, ')'), (1, 3, '('), (1, 1, '('), (2, 6, ')'), (2, 4, '('), (2, 2, ')'), (3, 5, ')')]`
  - **Result Construction**:
    - The result string will be: `()(()())`
  - **Output**: `()(()())`

This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, calculates the prefix balances, sorts the characters according to the specified rules, and constructs the correct output.

Final: **True**
