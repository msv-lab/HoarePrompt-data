Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition `n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this, and the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not the most common color is less than `k`. This is based on the idea that if Alice paints the ribbon such that the most common color appears `math.ceil(n / m)` times, Bob would need to repaint more than `k` parts to make all parts the same color. If this condition is true, Bob can still make all parts the same color, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output format for each test case, either 'NO' or 'Yes'.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint the single part.
   - For `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Alice can only use one color, and Bob can repaint any part.
   - For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], and Bob can only repaint one part.
   - For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   - For `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and Bob cannot repaint more than three parts to make all parts the same color.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
