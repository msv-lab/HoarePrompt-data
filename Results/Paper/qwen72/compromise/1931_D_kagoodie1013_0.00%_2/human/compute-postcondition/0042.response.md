Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.**

The code updates the `mod_y_map` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `mod_y_key` and the value is 1. If `mod_y_key` already existed in `mod_y_map`, its value would be incremented by 1. However, since `mod_y_map` was initially empty, the key `mod_y_key` is added with a value of 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
