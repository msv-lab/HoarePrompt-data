Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by 4, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 3, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `mod_x` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`.**
