Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is now an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by the sum of the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` (either 0, 1, or 2), `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by 4, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 3, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 3, `mod_x` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
