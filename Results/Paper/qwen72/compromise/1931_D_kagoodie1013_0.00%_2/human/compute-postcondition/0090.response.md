Output State: **`count` is the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `num % x` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `num % y` for all elements in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `results` now contains the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
