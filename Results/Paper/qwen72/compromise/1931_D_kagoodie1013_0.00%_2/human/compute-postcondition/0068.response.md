The code snippet `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` updates the value of `count` by adding the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` keys in the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries, respectively. If these keys do not exist in their respective dictionaries, the `get` method returns 0.

Given the initial state:
- `count` is 0.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples.
- `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` must have at least `n` elements.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
- `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`.
- `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.
- `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`.
- `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.
- `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.

Since both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are empty dictionaries, the `get` method will return 0 for both `mod_x` and `mod_y` keys. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by 0 + 0, which means `count` remains 0.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**
