Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**

The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `mod_y` is now specifically `num % y`.
