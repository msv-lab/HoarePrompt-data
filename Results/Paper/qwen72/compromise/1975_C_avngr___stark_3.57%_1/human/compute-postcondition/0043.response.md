Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `k + 1`, `max` is the minimum value between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is `k + 1`, `max` is now the minimum value between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
