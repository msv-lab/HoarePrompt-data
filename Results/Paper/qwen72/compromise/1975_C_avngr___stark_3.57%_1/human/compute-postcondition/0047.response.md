Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `k + 2`. If the minimum value between `a[k + 2]` and `a[k + 1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
