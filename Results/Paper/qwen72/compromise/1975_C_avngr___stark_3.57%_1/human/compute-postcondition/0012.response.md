Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2. If `min(a[2], a[1]) > max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains the maximum of the minimum values between `a[1]` and `a[0]` or 0 if no update occurred.***
