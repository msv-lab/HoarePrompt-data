The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `max` is the maximum of the minimum values between `a[1]` and `a[0]` or 0 if no update occurred.**
