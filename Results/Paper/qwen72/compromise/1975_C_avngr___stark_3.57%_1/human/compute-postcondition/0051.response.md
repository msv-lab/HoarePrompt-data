The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters within its signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept inputs that match these constraints. Specifically, it should handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. The function processes these inputs to produce an output.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array `a`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the prompt, but typically, such functions would return some computed result based on the input arrays for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
