Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-1`. `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum values of pairs `(a[j], a[j-1])` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]`. If no such pair has a minimum value greater than 0, `max` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t-1`), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values of all adjacent pairs in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
