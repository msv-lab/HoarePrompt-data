Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`kreker = int(input())`). It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop. This part is accurate.

2. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()` for each test case. This is also correct.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is done correctly.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` using the condition `if n >= m:`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This is where the program is incorrect.

5. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive) if `n` is even, or any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive) that has the same parity as `n` if `n` is odd.
   - The condition `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if `m` cubes can be in the tower after `n` moves. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program would print "Yes" even though it is impossible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves (the only possible outcomes are 0 or 2 cubes).

6. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be that `m` must be less than or equal to `n` and `m` must have the same parity as `n` (i.e., both `m` and `n` must be either even or odd).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`.

Final: **False**
