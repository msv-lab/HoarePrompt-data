The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function definition, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, as well as a list of integers `a` of length `n`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `k` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n.
  - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters and the conditions:
- Case_1: If `x` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ x ≤ n), the function returns an error message.
- Case_2: If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ k ≤ n), the function returns an error message.
- Case_3: For valid inputs, the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. If `x` or `k` is out of the valid range, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.**
