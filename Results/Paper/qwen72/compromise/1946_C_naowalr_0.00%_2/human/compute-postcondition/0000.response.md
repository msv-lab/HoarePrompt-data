The value of `t` is updated to the integer value read from the standard input. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.**
