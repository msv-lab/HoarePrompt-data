Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `z` is `t - 1` (which is the total number of iterations completed), `n` and `k` are the last values read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variable `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R - L <= 1`, and `L` is the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) are met, and `R` is `L + 1`.**
