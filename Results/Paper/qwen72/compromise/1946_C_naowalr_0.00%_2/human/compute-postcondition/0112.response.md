Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `leftover` is now the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not specified in the initial state, so it is left as the result of the function call.
