Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which results in 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.
