The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input.

Let's assume the input values are `new_n` and `new_k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**
