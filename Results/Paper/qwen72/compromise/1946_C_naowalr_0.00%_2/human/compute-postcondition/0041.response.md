Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is now `x`, and `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to `x`, which is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition `R - L > 1` is still valid, as the new value of `R` is derived from the previous values of `L` and `R`.
