The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.**
