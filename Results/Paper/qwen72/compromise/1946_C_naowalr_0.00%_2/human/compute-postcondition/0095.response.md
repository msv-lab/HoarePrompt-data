The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj[a]` by appending the value of `b` to it. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, except for the modification to the list `adj[a]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements.**
