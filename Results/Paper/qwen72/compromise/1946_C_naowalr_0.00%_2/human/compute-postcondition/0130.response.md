Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists as described, `t` and `z` remain unchanged, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R` is now `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
