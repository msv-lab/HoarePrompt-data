The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `R - L > 1`. Right before the loop, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. The difference `R - L` is 100000, which is greater than 1, so the loop will execute.

Since the condition is already met, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
