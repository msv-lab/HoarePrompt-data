Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or conditions in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `numCuts` is now explicitly set to 0.
