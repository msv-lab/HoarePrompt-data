Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, and `leftover` remain unchanged. `L` is the final value of `x` when the loop exits, which is the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) are met. `R` is `L + 1`. `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`.
- In each iteration, `x` is calculated as the midpoint between `L` and `R`.
- `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
- Depending on the conditions `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), either `L` is updated to `x` or `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will eventually narrow down the range `[L, R]` until `R - L <= 1`.
- At this point, `L` will be the largest integer such that the conditions are met, and `R` will be `L + 1`.
- The variables `n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, and `leftover` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
