The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, and `adj[b]` already contains `[a]`. After appending `a` to `adj[b]`, the list `adj[b]` will contain `[a, a]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.**
