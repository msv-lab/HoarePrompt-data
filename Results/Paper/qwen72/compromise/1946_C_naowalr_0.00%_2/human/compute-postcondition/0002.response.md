The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts these parts into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `z` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
