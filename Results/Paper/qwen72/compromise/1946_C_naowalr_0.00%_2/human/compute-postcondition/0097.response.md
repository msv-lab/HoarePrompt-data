The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
