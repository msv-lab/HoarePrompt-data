The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`.

- `a` and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input.
- The initial state variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
