Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input structure, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `n` as input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and it should be called for multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`. However, the function definition does not reflect this. The correct function definition should be `def func(n):` to match the problem's requirements.**
