Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\). If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\).
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to `n` based on user input.
- The conditions in the initial state are still valid after the code execution, but `n` is now the new input integer.
- The value of `power` is determined based on the new value of `n`:
  - If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
  - If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged.
  - Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.
