The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is 1, the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
- If `power` is equal to `n`, then the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- If `power` is not equal to `n`, then `power` is decreased by 1, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n_cases`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
- `n_cases` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `n` and `power` does not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\)** (if `n` is 1 or `power` equals `n`, the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged; otherwise, `power` is decreased by 1 and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\)).
