The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)` after the previous iteration. Since `power` is 3, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to proceed. This means `n` must be greater than 2^3, which is 8.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
