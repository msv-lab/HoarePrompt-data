The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\).
- If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
- If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n_cases` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\). If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**
