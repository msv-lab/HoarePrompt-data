Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input structure but is defined without parameters. `n_cases` is assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, then the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `power` is not equal to `n`, then `power` is decreased by 1, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\). If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\). If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
