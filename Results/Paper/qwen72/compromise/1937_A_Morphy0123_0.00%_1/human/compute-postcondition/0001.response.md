The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n_cases`. If `n_cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The function `func` being defined without parameters does not directly affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 before the first iteration.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
