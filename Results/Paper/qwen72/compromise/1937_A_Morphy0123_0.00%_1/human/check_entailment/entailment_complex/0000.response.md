Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take an integer `n` as a parameter to match the problem's requirements. However, the function reads the input directly within its body, which is a workaround but not a best practice.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `n_cases` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

3. **Base Case**: The function correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1 by printing 1 immediately.

4. **Power Calculation**: The function calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` using a while loop. This is done by incrementing `power` until \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).

5. **Output Logic**:
   - If `n` is a power of 2, the function prints \(2^{\text{power}}\).
   - If `n` is not a power of 2, the function prints \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\).

However, the logic for determining the position of 1 in the array after performing the swaps is incorrect. The problem requires finding the position of 1 after performing the swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`. The current logic does not accurately reflect the swap operations described in the problem.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves understanding the behavior of the swap operations:
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the element at position `i` is swapped with the element at the largest divisor `d` of `i` that is not `i` itself.
- The element 1 will move to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

Let's correct the function to accurately reflect the problem's requirements:

```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
            power = int(log2(n))
            print(2 ** power)
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the array is `[1]`, and the position of 1 is 1.
- **General Case**: For `n > 1`, the element 1 will end up at the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This is because the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` will be the last element to be swapped, and it will swap 1 to its position.

### Correctness:
The original function does not correctly implement the swap operations as described in the problem. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
