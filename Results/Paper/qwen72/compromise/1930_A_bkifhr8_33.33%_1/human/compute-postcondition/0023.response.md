The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `n * 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n * 2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50**
