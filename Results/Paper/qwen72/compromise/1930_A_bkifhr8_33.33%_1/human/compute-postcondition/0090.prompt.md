Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, and `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
