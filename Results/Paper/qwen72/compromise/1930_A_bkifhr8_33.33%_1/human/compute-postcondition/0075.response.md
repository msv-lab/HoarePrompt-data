Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.***
