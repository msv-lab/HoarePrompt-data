Output State: **`i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, and `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i` is `n * 2 - 1`**: The loop runs `n * 2` times, and `i` is incremented by 1 each time. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n * 2 - 1`.
- **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`ans` is the sum of the minimum of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements**: The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` during each iteration of the loop. This continues until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements left.
- **`lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining**: The loop removes elements from `lst` in pairs, and it stops when `lst` has 2 or fewer elements left. At the end of the loop, `lst` will have either 0 or 2 elements remaining. If it has 2 elements, the last iteration will add the minimum of these two elements to `ans` and then break out of the loop.
