The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` is 2) from the list `lst`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the length of `lst` is not 2. The first element of `lst` has been removed, and the element at index 2 of `lst` has been removed.**
