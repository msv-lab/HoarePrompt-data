The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. 

- The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input string `l` by spaces, but the first element of `lst` has already been removed.
- Removing the element at index 2 means the third element in the list (since indexing starts at 0) is removed.
- The length of `lst` is not 2, so removing the third element will still leave the list with at least one element.

The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, `ans`, and `ans_f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, but the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, and the length of `lst` is not 2.**
