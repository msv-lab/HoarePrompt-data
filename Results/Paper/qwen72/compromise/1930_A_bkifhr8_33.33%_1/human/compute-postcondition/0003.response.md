Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `ans_f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
