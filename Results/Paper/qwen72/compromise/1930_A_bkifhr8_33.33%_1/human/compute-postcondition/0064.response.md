Output State: **`i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with elements removed in pairs until 2 or fewer elements remain, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is an input string.**

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user, where 1 <= n <= 50. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
