Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical flaw in how it selects and removes elements from the list. Specifically, the `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` lines are incorrect. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be 0 and 2, respectively, which means the program will not correctly remove the elements it is supposed to. This will lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1 1 2 1
```
The program will process this as follows:
1. `lst = ['1', '1', '2', '1']`
2. First iteration:
   - `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` which is `min(1, 1) = 1`
   - `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` which removes `lst[0]` (the first '1')
   - `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` which removes `lst[2]` (the '2')
   - `lst` becomes `['1', '1']`
3. Second iteration:
   - `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` which is `min(1, 1) = 1`
   - `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` which removes `lst[0]` (the first '1')
   - `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` which removes `lst[2]` (but `lst` only has one element left, so this will raise an error)

The correct approach to solve this problem is to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements, as the minimum of each pair will always be the smaller of the two when the list is sorted. This ensures that the maximum score is achieved.
