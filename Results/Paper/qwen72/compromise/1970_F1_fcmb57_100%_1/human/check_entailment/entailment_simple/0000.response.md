Reasoning:  
The program provided is almost correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined to move a player based on the movement direction. However, the function is defined with parameters `a` and `b`, but `b` is a tuple (dx, dy) representing the movement direction. The function should correctly unpack `b` to `dx` and `dy` to avoid a `TypeError`.

2. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement or the player's ability to carry the Quaffle. The Quaffle should be moved when a player carrying it moves, and it should be reset to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is correct, but it should also handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which awards a point to the opposing team.

4. **Quaffle Reset**: After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, but the program does not implement this.

5. **Player Carrying the Quaffle**: The program does not track which player is carrying the Quaffle, which is essential for determining when a player can throw the Quaffle.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct and needs to be revised to handle the Quaffle's movement, player carrying the Quaffle, and the reset of the Quaffle after a goal.

Correctness: **False**
