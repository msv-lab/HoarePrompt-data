The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function is expected to return a value, but due to a TypeError caused by undefined variables `dx` and `dy`, it does not return a valid output.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. However, due to undefined variables `dx` and `dy`, the function raises a TypeError and does not return a valid output.**
