The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `s` is already specified as a non-empty string, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `char` should be the first character of the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `balance` is 0, `details` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`**
