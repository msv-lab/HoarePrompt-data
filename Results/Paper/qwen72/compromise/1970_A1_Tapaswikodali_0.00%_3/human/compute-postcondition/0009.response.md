Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a non-empty balanced parentheses string `s` from the user input, processes it to generate a sorted list of tuples representing the balance of parentheses, negative index, and character at each position, and then prints the original string `s` in the order of the sorted list. The function does not return any value. **
