The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of the number of cards of each type (`a`). For each test case, it calculates a final value (`ans`) based on the inputs and prints this value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of all test cases. After the function concludes, the state includes the number of test cases (`t`), the inputs for the last test case (`n`, `k`, and `a`), and the results of all test cases having been printed.
