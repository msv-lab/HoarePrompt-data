Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a` and is not 0, `res` remains `n - 1`, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`.***
