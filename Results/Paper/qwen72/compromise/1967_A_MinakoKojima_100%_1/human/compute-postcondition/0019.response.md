Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `k`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of the list `a` and is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, and the current value of `i` is not 0.** 

Note: The postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition, and additionally, it states that the current value of `i` is not 0, which is the if condition. However, since the precondition already states that `i` is 0, this postcondition is logically inconsistent. In a real program, the if condition would not be entered if `i` is 0. Therefore, the postcondition should be understood as a hypothetical state where the if condition is true, even though it contradicts the precondition.
