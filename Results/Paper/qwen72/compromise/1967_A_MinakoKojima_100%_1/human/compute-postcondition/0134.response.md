Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed and is now equal to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `res` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans_list` now contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element.
