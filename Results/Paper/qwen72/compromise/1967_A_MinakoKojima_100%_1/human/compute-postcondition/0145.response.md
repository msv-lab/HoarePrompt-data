Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is now equal to `n - 1`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second and first elements of `a` (`dif`) is 0.**
