The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is not directly involved in the loop head, but it provides context for the expected input.

Given the context, the loop will execute if the input is a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
