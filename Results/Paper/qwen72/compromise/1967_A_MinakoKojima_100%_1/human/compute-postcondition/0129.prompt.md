Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is now the first element of the list `a`, `ans_list` is a list that now contains the value of `ans` as its last element, and `res` is now `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` remains `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2` and `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1` and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` and `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `k`, `res`, and `ans` are not modified. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2` and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 4` and `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
