Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`, `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 4` if `dif` is 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` if `dif` is not 0, otherwise `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
