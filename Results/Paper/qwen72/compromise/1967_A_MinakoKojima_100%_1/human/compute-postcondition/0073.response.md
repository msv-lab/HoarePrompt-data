Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is now the first element of the list `a`, `ans_list` is a list that now contains the value of `ans` as its last element, and `res` is the initial value of `n - 1` minus the number of times `res` was decremented during the loop execution plus the remainder of `k` divided by `n` if `k` is not 0, or `res` retains its value from the loop execution if `k` is 0.**
