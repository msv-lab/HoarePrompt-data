Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The original list of integers provided by the user. It remains unchanged as it is only used to iterate over its elements.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[x]` contains the number of times the integer `x` appears in the list `a`.
- **`ans`**: This variable is calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. Since `cnt[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, count - 1)` for each unique value `x` in `a`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where each element in `a` has been processed and the counts have been updated accordingly.
