To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in cnt:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `cnt`.
- For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be a non-empty list.
- The length of `cnt` is `n + 1`, so `cnt` will be non-empty if `n` is at least 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `x`, which will take on the values of the elements in `cnt`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `cnt` must have at least one element, which means `n` must be at least 0.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `x` is the first element in `cnt`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`, `ans` is 0, `x` is the first element in `cnt`**.
