You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. The loop has printed the value of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the processing of the given sequence of integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
