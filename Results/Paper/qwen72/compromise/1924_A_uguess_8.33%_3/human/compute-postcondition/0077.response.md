Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cur` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and values of these variables are still valid as described in the initial state.
