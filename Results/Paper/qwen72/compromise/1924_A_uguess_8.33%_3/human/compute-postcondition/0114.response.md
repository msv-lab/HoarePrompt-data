Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at the position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.***
