Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `cur_ss` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- `ss` is the second character of the string `s`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
