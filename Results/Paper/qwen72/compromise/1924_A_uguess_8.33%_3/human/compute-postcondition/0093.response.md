To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(k):
```
This means that the loop iterates over the range of `k`, and the variable `i` is adjusted by the loop itself. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a'.
- If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is incremented by the loop itself.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current Value of `i`**: `i` is 1.
2. **Next Value of `i`**: The loop will increment `i` to 2.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2.
- The condition `i < k` must still hold for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a'. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
