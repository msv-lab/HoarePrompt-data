Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it. `tmp` is the character corresponding to the highest bit (i.e., `k-1`-th bit) of `cur` that is 0, or an empty string if all bits are 1.**
