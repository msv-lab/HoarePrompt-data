Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, which means that all the bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` are set to 1.**
