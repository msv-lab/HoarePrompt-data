Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
