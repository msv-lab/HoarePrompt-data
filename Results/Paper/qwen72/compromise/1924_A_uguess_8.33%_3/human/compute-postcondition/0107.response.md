The variable `cur_ss` is assigned the value of the ASCII code of the first character in `s` minus the ASCII code of the character 'a'. Since `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` will be the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.)**
