Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cur` is updated to 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The string `s` remains an input string with at least three characters.
- The value of `cnt` is still 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise it is 1, but since `cur` is now 0, `cnt` is 1.
- The value of `ss` remains the third character of `s`.
- The value of `cur_ss` remains the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
