The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is non-empty (i.e., it has at least one character), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is an input string, and for the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. At the start of the loop, `ss` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`**
