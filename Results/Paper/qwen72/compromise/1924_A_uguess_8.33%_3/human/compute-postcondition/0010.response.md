Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit corresponding to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a' is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to have that bit set. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
