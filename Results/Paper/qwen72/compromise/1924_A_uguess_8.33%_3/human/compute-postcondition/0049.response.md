To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `tmp` is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0, or `tmp` remains an empty string if all bits in `cur` are set to 1.
   - `ans` is updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `cur` is a bit mask (an integer where each bit represents a character in the alphabet).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cnt` is a positive integer.

3. **Operations:**
   - `i` is set to `k-1`, which means `i` is an index based on `k`.
   - `tmp` is determined by the bit mask `cur`. If `cur` has any bit set to 0, `tmp` is the last character in the alphabet corresponding to that bit. If all bits in `cur` are set to 1, `tmp` remains an empty string.
   - `ans` is updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after it has been updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Given the initial state and the operations, the final output will be a string `ans` that has been updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.

Output: **ans (where ans is the string `ans` after appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it)**
