Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is reset to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `cur` could be 0 if it had been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, or it could be the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'. After executing `cur = 0`, `cur` is now explicitly set to 0.
