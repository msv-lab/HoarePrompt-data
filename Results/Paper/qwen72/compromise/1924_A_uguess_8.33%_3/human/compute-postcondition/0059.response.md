Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << (ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a'), `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`.
- The initial value of `cur` is 0.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- Therefore, `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
