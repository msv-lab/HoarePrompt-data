The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string of length `n` that is constructed to contain exactly `n` sequences of `k` unique characters, based on the characters in `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, and the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` are in their final states as described in the annotations.
