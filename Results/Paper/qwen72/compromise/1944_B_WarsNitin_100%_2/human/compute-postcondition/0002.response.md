The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, and `q` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values from the input, while `t` and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
