To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`i`**: This is set to `len(l) - 1`, meaning it is the index of the last element in the list `l`.
2. **`l`**: This is a list with `len(l)` elements.
3. **`ans1` and `ans2`**: Both include all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0.
4. **`k`**: This is 0.
5. **`n`, `req`, and `m`**: These remain unchanged, but they are not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

Given that `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, and since `k` is 0, `ans2` will contain all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` was decremented to 0.

However, without knowing the exact values of `l` and the specific point where `k` became 0, we can only describe the output in general terms.

### Explanation:
- `*ans2` in the `print` statement will unpack the elements of `ans2` and print them separated by spaces.
- Since `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, the output will be the elements of `l` up to that point.

### Final Output:
Output: **elements of l up to the point where k became 0 (separated by spaces)**

This means that if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k` became 0 after processing the first three elements, the output would be `1 2 3`. If `k` became 0 after processing all elements, the output would be all elements of `l`. Without the exact values, this is the most precise description possible.
