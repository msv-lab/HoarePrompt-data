Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is 0, `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` appended to its previous contents.** 

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index 3 of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `k` is 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid. The initial state that `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` is updated to reflect that this element has been appended to `ans1`.
