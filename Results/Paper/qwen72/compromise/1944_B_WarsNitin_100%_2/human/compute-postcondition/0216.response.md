Output State: **`i` is the length of `l` minus 1, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the elements starting from the `n`-th element to the end, `req` is equal to the new value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the `n`-th element of the sorted sublist `b` to the list `l`. Since `l` initially contains the first element of `b` (if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`), after executing the code, `l` now contains the first element of `b` followed by the `n`-th element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
