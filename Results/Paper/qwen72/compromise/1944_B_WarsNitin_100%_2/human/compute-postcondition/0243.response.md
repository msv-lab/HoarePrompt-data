The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 (or more specifically, `n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `i < n - 1` holds true).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4**
