Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `l` has `len(l)` elements: This confirms that `l` is a list with a certain number of elements.
- `ans1` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0: This means `ans1` is a list that contains all elements from `l` up to the point where `k` was decremented to 0.
- `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0: This is the same as `ans1`.
- `k` is 0: This confirms that `k` is now 0.
- `n` remains unchanged: This means the value of `n` has not changed.
- `req` remains unchanged: This means the value of `req` has not changed.
- `m` remains unchanged: This means the value of `m` has not changed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the list `ans1`.
- Since `ans1` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, the output will be the elements of `l` up to that point.

### Final Output:
The code will print the elements of `ans1`, which are the elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0.

Output: **elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0** (where `k` is 0 and `ans1` contains the elements of `l` up to that point).
