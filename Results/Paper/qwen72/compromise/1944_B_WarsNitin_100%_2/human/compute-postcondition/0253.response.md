Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `req`, `ans1` contains the repeated elements from `b` where `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and `l` contains the unique elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element `b[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `req`, while the values of `i`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and `l` are still valid as they were in the initial state.
