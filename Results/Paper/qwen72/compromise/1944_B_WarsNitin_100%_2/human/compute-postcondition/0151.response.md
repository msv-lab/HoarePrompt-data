Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is -2 and `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `k` is set to -4, and `ans1` now includes the elements at index 2 and index 2 of `b`. If `k` is -2 and `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` is a list that now includes the element `b[2]` and `b[3]`. If `k` is -2 and `b[i] == b[i + 1]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`.***
