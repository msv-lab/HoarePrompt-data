Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as in the initial state, `k` is `req - 2 * m` where `m` is the number of times `c[i]` was equal to `c[i - 1]` during the loop execution, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, and `ans2` contains the values of `c[i]` appended twice for each occurrence where `c[i]` was equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` reaches `0` before the loop completes, the loop breaks, and the state of `ans1` and `l` remains as described above.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` contains the first element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` as its last element, `k` is `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` now contains the first two elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first and second elements of `l`, `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` has at least 2 elements, `ans1` contains the first three elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `k` is `k - 3`, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
