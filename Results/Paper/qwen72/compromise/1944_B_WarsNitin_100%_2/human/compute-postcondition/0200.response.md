Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the last index of the list `l` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which `k` became 0 if the loop breaks early.
- `ans1` contains all the elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0.
- `ans2` contains the same elements as `ans1`.
- `k` is 0 after the loop.

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

Since `ans1` contains all the elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, the output will be the elements of `ans1` printed in the order they appear in the list.

Output: **elements of ans1 (where ans1 contains all the elements of l up to the point where k became 0)**

For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k` became 0 at index 2, then `ans1` would be `[1, 2, 3]` and the output would be:

Output: **1 2 3**
