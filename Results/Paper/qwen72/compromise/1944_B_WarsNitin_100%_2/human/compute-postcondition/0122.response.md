To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `-1`
- `n` is an input integer

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty.
- For `range(1, n - 1)` to be non-empty, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
