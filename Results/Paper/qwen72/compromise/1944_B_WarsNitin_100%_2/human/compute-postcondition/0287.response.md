Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is `req - 2 * count_of_pairs - 1`, `ans2` contains the repeated elements from `c` where `c[i] == c[i - 1]` and the first element of `l`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `ans1` now includes the first element of `l`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
