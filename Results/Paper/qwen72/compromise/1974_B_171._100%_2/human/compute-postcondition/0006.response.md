Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order from the `unique_chars` list, `len_unique` remains the same as the length of `unique_chars`, and `decoded` is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`.**
