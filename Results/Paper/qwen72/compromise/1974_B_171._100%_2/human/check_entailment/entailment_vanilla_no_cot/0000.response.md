Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
   - It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the decoded strings in a list `results` and prints each one after all test cases have been processed.

This approach ensures that the original string is correctly restored from the encoded string, as demonstrated by the example test cases provided. The program handles the constraints and input format correctly, and the logic for decoding is sound.
