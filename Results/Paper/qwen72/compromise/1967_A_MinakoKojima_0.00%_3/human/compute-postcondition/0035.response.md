Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `k` is updated to `k - n * m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to be the original value of `k` minus the product of `n` and `m`, where `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
