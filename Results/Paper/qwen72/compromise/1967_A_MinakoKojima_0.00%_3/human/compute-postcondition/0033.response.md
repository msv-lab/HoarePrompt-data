Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` reassigns the value of `ans` to 0, but since `ans` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
