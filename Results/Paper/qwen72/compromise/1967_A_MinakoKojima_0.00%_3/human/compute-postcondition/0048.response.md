Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value (`a[0]`) with the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
