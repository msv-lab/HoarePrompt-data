Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` reassigns the value of `ans` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
