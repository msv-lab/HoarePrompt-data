The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range derived from the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. 

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, this condition is already met, and no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will start with `_` being 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0**
