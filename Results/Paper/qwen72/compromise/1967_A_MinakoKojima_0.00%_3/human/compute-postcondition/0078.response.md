The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is now 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `_` remains the same (2), `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is now 3, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, but `ans` is now `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`**
