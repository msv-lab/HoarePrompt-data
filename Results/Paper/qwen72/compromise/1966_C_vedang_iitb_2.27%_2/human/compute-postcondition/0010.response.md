Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that n == len(a), `n` is greater than 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and either `winNext` is 2 or `winNext` is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1.**
