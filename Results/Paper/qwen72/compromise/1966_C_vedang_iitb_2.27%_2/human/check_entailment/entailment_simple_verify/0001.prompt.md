You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of integers `a` representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts the list and removes duplicates to get a new list `a_new`.
   - Then, it modifies `a_new` such that each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be used to determine the winner more easily.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n` representing the number of piles.
   - It uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
   - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones in one move.
   - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it is even, Alice wins; if it is odd, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the winner of the game if the smallest pile is removed. If the next player (Bob) loses, Alice wins. If the next player wins and the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, Alice wins by removing all stones from the single pile. This is correct.
     - For `n == 2`, the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile is even, Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move, winning the game. If the smallest pile is odd, Alice must remove one stone, leaving Bob with an even number of stones in both piles, which Bob can then remove to win. This is correct.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The function `func_2` correctly handles the recursive case by checking if the next player (Bob) loses or wins. If Bob loses, Alice wins. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can still win by removing the smallest pile size. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is 1, Alice cannot win because she must remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with a winning position.
   - **Transformation by `func_1`:**
     - The transformation performed by `func_1` is crucial for the recursive function `func_2` to work correctly. By converting the list of pile sizes into differences, the function can efficiently determine the winner based on the transformed list.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly determines the winner of the game for any valid input.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the optimal play strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
