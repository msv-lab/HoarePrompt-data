Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
3 3 3
```

The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) on her first turn, which will empty all the piles at once, and Bob will be unable to make a move.

However, the program will output "Bob" because the recursive logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones. The function `func_2` is designed to check if the first player can win by considering the remaining piles after the first move, but it does not correctly account for the optimal move that Alice can make to win immediately.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
