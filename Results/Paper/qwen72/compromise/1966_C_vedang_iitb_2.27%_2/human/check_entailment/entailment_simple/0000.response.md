### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function processes the list of pile sizes to create a new list where each element (except the first one) is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list.
   - **Implementation**:
     - `a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))`: This line sorts the unique pile sizes.
     - `a_temp = a_new.copy()`: This line creates a copy of the sorted unique list.
     - `for i in range(1, len(a_new))`: This loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
     - `a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]`: This line calculates the difference between the current element and the previous element.
   - **Output**: The function returns a new list `a_new` where the first element is the smallest pile size, and each subsequent element is the difference between the current pile size and the previous one.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly processes the input list to create the desired output list.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the processed list of pile sizes.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Base Case 1**: If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
     - **Base Case 2**: If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on the parity of the first pile size:
       - If the first pile size is even (`a[0] % 2 == 0`), Alice wins because she can always choose a \( k \) that leaves an even number of stones in the second pile, forcing Bob to lose.
       - If the first pile size is odd (`a[0] % 2 != 0`), Bob wins because Alice will always leave an odd number of stones in the second pile, and Bob can then choose a \( k \) that leaves an even number of stones, forcing Alice to lose.
     - **Recursive Case**: For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the subgame with the remaining piles:
       - `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`: This line recursively calls `func_2` with the remaining piles.
       - If `winNext == 2` or `winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`, Alice wins:
         - `winNext == 2` means Bob loses in the subgame, so Alice wins.
         - `winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1` means Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
       - Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case. It ensures that the game is analyzed optimally by considering the smallest pile and the parity of the first pile size.

4. **Main Program**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - **Function Calls**:
     - `a = func_1(a)`: This call processes the list of pile sizes.
     - `n = len(a)`: This updates the number of piles after processing.
     - `if func_2(a, n) == 1: print('Alice') else: print('Bob')`: This determines the winner based on the result of `func_2`.
   - **Correctness**: The main program correctly reads the input, processes the pile sizes, and prints the winner for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly processes the input to determine the winner of the game for each test case, considering the optimal play of both players.

Correctness: **True**
