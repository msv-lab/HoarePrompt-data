Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book, and an integer `n` representing the number of books, such that 2 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.**
