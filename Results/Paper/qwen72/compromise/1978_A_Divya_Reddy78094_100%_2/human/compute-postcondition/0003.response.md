The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the number of pages in each book, and `n` represents the number of books. The constraints are 2 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The function returns the total number of pages across all books in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the number of pages in each book and `n` is the number of books (2 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). It returns the total number of pages across all books in the list `a`.**
