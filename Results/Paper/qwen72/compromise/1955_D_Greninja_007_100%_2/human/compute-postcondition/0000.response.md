Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` creates a new variable `cb` that is a Counter object from the `collections` module. This Counter object contains the frequency of each element in the list `b` after it has been sorted. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
