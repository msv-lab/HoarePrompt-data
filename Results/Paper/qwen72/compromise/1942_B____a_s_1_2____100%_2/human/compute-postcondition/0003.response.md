The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns a valid permutation `p` for the given data, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation for the given data.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (list of integers). It returns a valid permutation `p` for the given data, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation for the given data.**
