You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and then for each iteration from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 9) from the input. For each pair of integers, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` are the last values read from the input, and the program state is unchanged in terms of the number of iterations `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The logic is straightforward and works for all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail.
