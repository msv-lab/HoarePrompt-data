Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Comparison and Output**: Inside the loop, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If it is, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This ensures that the minimum of `x` and `y` is always printed first, followed by the maximum.

3. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints correctly. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case within the specified range of inputs (0 to 9).

4. **Example Validation**: The program produces the correct output for the given example input, which matches the expected output.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
