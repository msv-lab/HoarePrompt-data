The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `sym`, which is a string used as a separator. The function returns a string that contains the elements of `arr` converted to strings, each followed by the `sym` separator, concatenated together, with the final `sym` separator at the end of the string. The list `arr` and the string `sym` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It returns a string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string, followed by `sym`, and the final `sym` is included at the end of the string.**
