Output State: **`E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] <= 0` and `D[out_aa] > 0`, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their integer values, `aa` and `bb` remain lists of strings, `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` remain Counter objects with their respective frequencies, `D` remains the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` remains the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` remains the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `m` is less than `n`, and `n - m` is greater than 0, the next `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and the next `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.**
