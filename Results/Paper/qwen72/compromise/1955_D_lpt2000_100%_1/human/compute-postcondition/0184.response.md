Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (before any changes) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The next pair `(in_aa, out_aa)` will be the next elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, if `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and the value of `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is still decremented by 1.***
