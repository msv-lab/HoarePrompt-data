Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input, `bb` is a list of strings derived from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with values being the minimum counts of common elements, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of strings derived from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with values being the minimum counts of common elements, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` was initially greater than or equal to `k` and 2 if `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 0, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (but remains non-negative), `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`, `E`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `C`) retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables (`in_aa`, `out_aa`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `C`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`) retain their previous values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
