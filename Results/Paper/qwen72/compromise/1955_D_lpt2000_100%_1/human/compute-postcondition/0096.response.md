Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from user input. `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces. `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces. `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`. `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`. `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`. `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`. `fnd` is initially 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0. `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. The next `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and the next `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. The count of `out_aa` in `E` is decremented by 1.**
