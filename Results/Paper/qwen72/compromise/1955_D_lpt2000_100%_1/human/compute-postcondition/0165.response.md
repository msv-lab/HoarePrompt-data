Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` are updated based on the conditions, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is updated based on the conditions. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `E[out_aa]` is updated based on the conditions, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.***
