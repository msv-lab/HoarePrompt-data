Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. This is because if one of the dimensions is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - If `a` is even, it checks if the two resulting rectangles (each of size `a // 2` by `b`) can form a new rectangle that is different from the original `a x b` rectangle. Specifically, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it checks if the two resulting rectangles (each of size `a` by `b // 2`) can form a new rectangle that is different from the original `a x b` rectangle. Specifically, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - If either of the above conditions is met, the program prints "Yes".
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints "No".

This logic ensures that the program correctly identifies whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given `a x b` rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides and reassembling the pieces.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
