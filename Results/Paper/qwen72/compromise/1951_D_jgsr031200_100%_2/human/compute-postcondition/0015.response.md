Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
   - `costs` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` is `0 // (1 - k)`, which is 0 for any value of `k` (since 0 divided by any non-zero number is 0).
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` is `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - `h` is less than `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this condition implies that `k` must be greater than 0.

4. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the condition `h < k` is satisfied because `h` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
