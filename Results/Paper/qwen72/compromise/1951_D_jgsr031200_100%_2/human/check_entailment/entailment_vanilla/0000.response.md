### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from one stall if each jewel costs 1 coin.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Stall Setup:**
   - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall price is `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall (since `n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k`).
   - The second stall price is 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using integer division and updates the remaining coins.
   - It then checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES" and the stall setup with the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n == k` and `n < k`.
- The stall setup with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels:
  - From the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel if she has at least `n - k + 1` coins.
  - From the second stall, Alice buys the remaining `k - 1` jewels, each costing 1 coin.
- The program ensures that the number of stalls is 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
