Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. The values of `n` and `s` remain undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop. The loop prints each element of the `results` list in sequence, but does not alter the list itself or any other variables outside the loop.
