You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: n (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and s (a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"). The function is expected to be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. The values of `n` and `s` will be undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. The values of `n` and `s` remain undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop. The loop prints each element of the `results` list in sequence, but does not alter the list itself or any other variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `s` (a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"). It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
