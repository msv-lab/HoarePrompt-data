Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Check**: The program attempts to find a subsequence by maintaining a set `win` of characters seen so far. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly track all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The program only checks if a set of `k` unique characters is found in the string `s` and then clears the set, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**: The program generates a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character not in `win`. This approach is also incorrect because it does not ensure that the generated string is a valid subsequence that does not appear in `s`.

3. **Function Call and Definition**: The function `func_1` is called inside a loop, but the function itself is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is used before it is defined.

4. **Random Number Generation**: The variable `rrr` is assigned a random number, but this value is never used in the program. It is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the missing string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_subsequence Function**: This function checks if string `x` is a subsequence of string `y` by iterating through `y` and checking if all characters of `x` appear in `y` in the same order.
2. **func_1 Function**:
   - Reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `m`.
   - Generates the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - Uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using these alphabets.
   - Checks if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, prints "NO" and the missing string, and returns.
   - If all strings are subsequences, prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible subsequences and handles the problem as described.
