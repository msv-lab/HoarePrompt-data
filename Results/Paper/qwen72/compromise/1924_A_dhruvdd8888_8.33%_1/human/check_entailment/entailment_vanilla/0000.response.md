Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. However, the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which is a logical error. This should be fixed by moving the function call inside the loop after the function definition.

2. **Set Initialization**: The program initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Window Set**: The program uses a set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window of the string `s`. The idea is to clear this set once it contains all `k` characters and then move to the next window.

4. **Answer Construction**: The program appends characters to the list `ans` whenever the set `win` contains all `k` characters. This is intended to check if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly check all possible subsequences of length `n`.

5. **Output**: If the length of `ans` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`. The construction of the string is incorrect because it does not ensure that the string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues:
- **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will cause a runtime error.
- **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if the string `s` contains all `k` characters in a window, which is not sufficient.
- **Incorrect String Construction**: The program constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by appending characters from `win` and then adding a character not in `win` and padding with 'a'. This does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
- If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
