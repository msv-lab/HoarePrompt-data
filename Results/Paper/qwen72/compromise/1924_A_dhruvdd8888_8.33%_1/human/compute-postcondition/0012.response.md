Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters.
- `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is a hardcoded string.

Output: **NO**
