You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The inputs a and b for each test case satisfy 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')

            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: The function `func` processes all test cases, printing 'yes' for rectangles where both dimensions are even, and 'no' for all other cases. The variables `a` and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be combined to form a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd side will always result in at least one odd side, and the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated.
   - If one side is even and the other is odd, Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting the even side. For example, a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can be combined to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - The first condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If so, it prints "yes". This is correct.
   - The second condition checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is \(-a\) or \(-b\). This is not a valid condition for the problem. The correct condition should be if either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, because a \(1 \times n\) rectangle cannot be cut to form a different rectangle.
   - The third condition checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd. This is also not a valid condition. The correct condition should be if one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd.
   - The fourth condition is a catch-all for the remaining cases, which should be "no" if the first two conditions are not met.

4. **Correcting the Program**:
   - The second condition should be replaced with a check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1.
   - The third condition should be replaced with a check if one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 != 0) or (a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 == 0):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original program has logical errors in the second and third conditions.
   - The corrected program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
