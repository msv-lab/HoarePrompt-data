Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map". The program only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and subtracts the count of "mapie" (which is not a valid substring to consider). This approach does not account for the overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map" or the correct minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input string "mappie":
- The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- It will also count 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- The program will output 1 + 1 - 0 = 2.

However, the correct output should be 1, as removing the 'p' at index 3 will make the string "maie" which is beautiful. The program fails to handle this case correctly.
