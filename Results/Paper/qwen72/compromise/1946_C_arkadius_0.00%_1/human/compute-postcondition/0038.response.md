The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. If this list has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and `u` will be the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
