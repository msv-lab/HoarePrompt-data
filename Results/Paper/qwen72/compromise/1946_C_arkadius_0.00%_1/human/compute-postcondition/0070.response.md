The code snippet `stack.append((u, False))` appends the tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. This impacts the `stack` by adding one more tuple to it. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and the tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to `stack`.**
