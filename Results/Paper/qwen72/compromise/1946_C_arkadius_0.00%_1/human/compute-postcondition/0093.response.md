Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in `tree` that has had all its children processed, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. The `good_components` value of `v` is the sum of the `good_components` of all its children, plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
