Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a positive integer `k` (1 <= k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns the largest integer `beg` such that the function `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`. After the function concludes, `tree` remains a Tree object with `n` vertices, and `k` is unchanged. The value of `beg` is the largest integer for which `func_3` returns `True`, and `end` is equal to `beg`. **
