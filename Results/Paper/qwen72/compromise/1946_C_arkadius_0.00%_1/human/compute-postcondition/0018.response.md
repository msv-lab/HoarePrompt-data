Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is now `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, `beg` is updated to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `end` remains either `n` or `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `end` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `beg` remains either `(n + 2) // 2` or 1.***
