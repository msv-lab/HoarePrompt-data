You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, s is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and `stack` is an empty list. For each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` contains the total number of good components (subtrees where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component) rooted at `v`. The `remaining_size` of each vertex `v` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The variables `s` and `x` remain unchanged.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the remaining size of vertex `s`. The `good_components` value for `s` is the total number of subtrees where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component. The `remaining_size` of `s` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the remaining size of vertex `s`. A good component is a subtree where each child's remaining size is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component. The remaining size of `s` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose remaining size is less than `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the remaining size of vertex `s`. The `good_components` value for `s` is the total number of subtrees where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component. The `remaining_size` of `s` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
