Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and an edge has been added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance.** 

The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between the nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `tree` instance now includes this additional edge.
