Functionality: ** The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and reads input values directly. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges, where `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The tree is rooted at node 0, and the function prints the number of nodes that are at a distance `k` from the root node. The final state of the program includes the constructed tree and the printed result, but no return value is specified. **
