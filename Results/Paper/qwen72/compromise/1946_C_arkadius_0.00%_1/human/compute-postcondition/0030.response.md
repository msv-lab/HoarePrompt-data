Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has at least three children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` >= `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
