The loop head only contains the variable `stack`, which is a list. The loop can execute again if `stack` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, a tuple was removed from `stack`, so to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `stack` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining.**
