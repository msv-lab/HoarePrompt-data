Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, and `postorder` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, and `postorder` is `True`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has at least two children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `u` is the second child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has at least three children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` >= `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
