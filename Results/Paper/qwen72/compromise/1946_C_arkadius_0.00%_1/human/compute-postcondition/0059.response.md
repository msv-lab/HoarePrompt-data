Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is True, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + 1`.** 

In natural language: The `tree` object remains unchanged except for the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v`. The `good_components` of vertex `v` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
