Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is True, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to the sum of its original value and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, plus the `good_components` of all other children. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its original value and the `remaining_size` of all children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `tree` object remains a valid tree with its vertices and edges properly defined.
- The `s` variable still represents a non-negative integer that is a vertex in the tree.
- The `x` variable still represents a non-negative integer within the range 0 to n.
- The `postorder` variable is still True, indicating that the vertex `v` has been processed in postorder.
- The `v` variable is still the first element of the tuple that was popped from the `stack`.
- The `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed, as it was before the loop started.
- The `tree.vertices[v].children` list has been fully processed, meaning all children of vertex `v` have been considered.
- The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` value has been updated to include the `good_components` of all children, plus an additional count for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- The `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` value has been updated to include the `remaining_size` of all children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
