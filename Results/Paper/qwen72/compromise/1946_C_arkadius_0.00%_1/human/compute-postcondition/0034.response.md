Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v, postorder = stack.pop()` updates the values of `v` and `postorder` by popping the last tuple from the `stack` list. The first element of the tuple is assigned to `v`, and the second element is assigned to `postorder`. The `stack` list is now one element shorter, with the last tuple removed. The other variables (`tree`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
