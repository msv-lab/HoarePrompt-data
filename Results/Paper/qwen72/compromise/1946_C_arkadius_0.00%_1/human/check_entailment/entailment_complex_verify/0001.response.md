### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - This is a classic problem that can be solved using a combination of tree traversal and binary search.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program is structured into several functions:
     - `func_1`: A non-recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_2`: A recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_3`: A function to check if a given `x` is a valid solution.
     - `func_4`: A binary search function to find the maximum `x`.
     - `func_5`: The main function to read input and call the other functions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.
     - It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The function is designed to handle large trees without causing a stack overflow.
     - **State After Execution**: The function correctly returns the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `s`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function is a recursive version of the tree traversal.
     - It correctly counts the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
     - The function is used to verify the correctness of the non-recursive approach in `func_1`.
     - **State After Execution**: The function returns the same values as `func_1` for the same inputs, confirming its correctness.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is a valid solution by calling `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - **State After Execution**: The function correctly returns `True` or `False` based on the conditions specified.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n` and iteratively narrows down the range until it finds the maximum valid `x`.
     - **State After Execution**: The function correctly returns the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.

   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
     - It handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each one.
     - **State After Execution**: The function correctly prints the result for each test case.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the provided edges.
   - The output is printed for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 (no edges are removed) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the tree is a single vertex (n = 1) correctly.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is an efficient approach for this problem.
   - The tree traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly count the good components and remaining sizes.
   - The validation function (`func_3`) correctly checks if the given `x` is a valid solution.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is logically sound and follows the correct approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and uses efficient algorithms to find the maximum `x`.

Final: **True**
