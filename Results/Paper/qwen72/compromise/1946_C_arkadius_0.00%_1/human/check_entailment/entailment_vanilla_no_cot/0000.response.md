Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Tree Class Definition Missing**: The program assumes the existence of a `Tree` class, but the definition of this class is not provided. Without this, it's impossible to know how the tree is structured, how edges are added, and how the tree is rooted.

2. **Inconsistent Function Usage**: There are two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, that seem to perform similar tasks but are used inconsistently. `func_1` is used in `func_3`, but `func_2` is not used anywhere in the provided code. This inconsistency suggests that the program might not be correctly structured.

3. **Handling of Rooting the Tree**: The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called in `func_5`, but the implementation of this function is not provided. It's unclear how the tree is being rooted, which is crucial for the correctness of the program.

4. **Input Handling**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, but the program only reads and processes one test case. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case in a loop.

5. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result for each test case, but it does not handle the output for multiple test cases in a loop.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:

1. Define the `Tree` class with methods to add edges and root the tree.
2. Ensure that the tree is correctly rooted before processing.
3. Use a consistent approach to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and remaining sizes.
4. Handle multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and processing each one in a loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = []
        self.good_components = 0
        self.remaining_size = 1

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.vertices = [TreeNode() for _ in range(n)]
        self.n = n
        self.root = 0

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.vertices[u].children.append(v)
        self.vertices[v].children.append(u)

    def root_tree_non_recursive(self, root, parent):
        stack = [(root, parent)]
        while stack:
            (v, p) = stack.pop()
            for u in self.vertices[v].children:
                if u == p:
                    continue
                stack.append((u, v))
                self.vertices[u].children = [x for x in self.vertices[u].children if x != v]
            if p != -1:
                self.vertices[p].children = [x for x in self.vertices[p].children if x != v]

def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        (v, postorder) = stack.pop()
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
    return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

def func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:
    (good_components, remaining_size) = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if good_components > k:
        return True
    if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:
        return True
    return False

def func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return beg

def func_5():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
        tree = Tree(n)
        for i in range(1, n):
            [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
            tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
        print(func_4(tree, n, k))

func_5()
```

This corrected version includes the necessary `Tree` class and handles multiple test cases correctly. It also ensures that the tree is rooted properly before processing.
