### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by \( k_i \).

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) to determine a common denominator.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - Finally, it checks if the total bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it outputs -1.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula: \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - The function is efficient and mathematically sound.

4. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The function reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) from the user.
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iterates through the list of multipliers, updating `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - This part of the function is correct and ensures that `den` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - It calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier.
     - This part is also correct and ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a multiple of each multiplier.
   - **Total Bet Check:**
     - It calculates the total bet as the sum of all bets.
     - It then checks if the total bet is less than `den`. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it outputs -1.
     - This check is crucial to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total bet is a multiple of each multiplier.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which means the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the condition is not met, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the function correctly outputs -1.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the bets is equal to or greater than the LCM, which is the correct behavior.
   - It also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, which can result in no valid distribution (as seen in the third test case).

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the bets and checks the conditions to ensure a valid distribution of coins.

Final: **True**
