Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input consists of multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func_2` only processes a single test case and does not loop over the number of test cases `t`. This means that if the input contains more than one test case, the program will not correctly process all of them, leading to incorrect output.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
```
The program will only process the first test case and ignore the second one, which is not in line with the problem description.
