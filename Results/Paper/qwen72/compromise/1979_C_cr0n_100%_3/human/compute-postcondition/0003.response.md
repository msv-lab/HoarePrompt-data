To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `vals`. The loop will execute if `vals` is not empty. Given the initial state, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and `vals` is a list of N integers read from the input, where each integer is between 2 and 20, inclusive. This means `vals` is guaranteed to have at least one element (since N is at least 1).

Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `vals` is not empty. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `vals` during the first iteration.

State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers read from the input, where each integer is between 2 and 20, inclusive, `den` is equal to the first integer in `vals`, `x` is the first integer in `vals`**
