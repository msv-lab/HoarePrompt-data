The value of `max` is decremented by 1. If `x` is even, `max` was initially 99999998, so after the decrement, `max` is 99999997. If `x` is odd, `max` was initially 100000000, so after the decrement, `max` is 99999999. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `t` is 2, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even; `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even; `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]` if `x` is even; `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]` if `x` is odd.**
