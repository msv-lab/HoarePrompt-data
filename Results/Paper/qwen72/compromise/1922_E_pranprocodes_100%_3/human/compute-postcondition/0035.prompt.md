Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000 or 99999999 depending on whether `x` is odd or even, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 if `x` is even or -100000000 if `x` is odd, `x` is updated to `x` divided by 2 if `x` is even or remains unchanged if `x` is odd, `t` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, updated to `x // 2` if `x` was even or remains unchanged if `x` was odd, then `x` is decreased by 1 if `x` was odd; `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, or 99999998 if `x` was odd; `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even, or -99999999 if `x` was odd, then `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd; `ans` is a list containing 100000000 if `x` was even or -100000000 if `x` was odd, and now also contains `max` if `x` was even, or [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd; `t` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, updated to `x // 2` if `x` was originally even or remains unchanged if `x` was originally odd, then `x` is decreased by 1 if `x` was originally odd. `max` is 99999998 if `x` was originally even, or 99999997 if `x` was originally odd. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was originally even, or -99999998 if `x` was originally odd. `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was originally even, or [-100000000, 99999998, -99999998] if `x` was originally odd. `t` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
