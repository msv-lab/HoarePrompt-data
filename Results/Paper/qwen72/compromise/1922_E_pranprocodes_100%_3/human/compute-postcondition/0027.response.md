The code snippet `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` depends on whether `x` was even or odd. If `x` was even, `max` is 99999999, and if `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998. The list `ans` already contains 100000000 if `x` was even or -100000000 if `x` was odd, and it will now also contain `max`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, updated to `x // 2` if `x` was even or remains unchanged if `x` was odd, then `x` is decreased by 1 if `x` was odd; `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, or 99999998 if `x` was odd; `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even, or -99999999 if `x` was odd, then `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd; `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was even, or [-100000000, 99999998] if `x` was odd; `t` is 2.**
