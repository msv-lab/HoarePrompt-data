To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered).
   - `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered).
   - `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` starts at 1, which is an odd number.
   - Since `x` is 1, it will not change, and the loop will terminate immediately.
   - Therefore, `x` will only be 1 for one iteration.

3. **Calculating `max` and `min`:**
   - `max` will be 100000000 - 0 (since no even `x` values are encountered).
   - `min` will be -100000000 + 1 (since one odd `x` value is encountered).

4. **Building the `ans` List:**
   - Since `x` is 1 (odd) and the loop runs only once, `ans` will contain only one value, which is `min`.
   - `ans` will be `[-100000000 + 1]` or `[-99999999]`.

5. **Determining `t`:**
   - `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.
   - Since `x` starts at 1 and the loop runs only once, `t` will be 1.

Given this analysis, the `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
