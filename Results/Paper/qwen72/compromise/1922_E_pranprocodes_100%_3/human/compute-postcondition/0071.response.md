The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state, if `x` is odd, it is updated to `x - 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `x` is now `x - 1` (if `x` was odd), `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, -99999999, and -99999998, and `t` is 2.**
