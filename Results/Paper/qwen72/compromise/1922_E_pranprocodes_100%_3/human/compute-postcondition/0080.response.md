Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max = 100000000` reassigns the value of `max` to 100000000, overriding any previous value that `max` might have had. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
