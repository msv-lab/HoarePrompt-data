The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input value that defines the range. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input value. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, the input value must be greater than 1**
