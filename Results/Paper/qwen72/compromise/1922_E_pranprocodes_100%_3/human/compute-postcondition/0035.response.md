Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - k, `min` is -100000000 + k, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed, and `t` is `k`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: The loop continues to execute until `x` becomes 1. Depending on whether `x` was originally even or odd, it will be halved and decremented until it reaches 1.
- **`max`**: Decreases by 1 each time `x` is even. The total number of times `max` is decremented is the number of even `x` values encountered during the loop execution.
- **`min`**: Increases by 1 each time `x` is odd. The total number of times `min` is incremented is the number of odd `x` values encountered during the loop execution.
- **`ans`**: Contains a sequence of values where each even `x` appends the current `max` and each odd `x` appends the current `min`. The sequence alternates between `max` and `min` values, starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd.
- **`t`**: Counts the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is the same as `k`.

The loop will stop when `x` becomes 1, and the final state will reflect the changes in `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` based on the number of iterations `k`.
