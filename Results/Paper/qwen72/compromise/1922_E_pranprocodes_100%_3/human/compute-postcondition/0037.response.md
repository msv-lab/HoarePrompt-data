Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `x` is 1
- `max` is 100000000 - k
- `min` is -100000000 + k
- `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, but now reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`
- `t` is `k`

The `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is `k`.

Since `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it as `k`.

Output: **k**
