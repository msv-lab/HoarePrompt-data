The `ans.reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd. Since `x` is 1 (which is odd), the list `ans` starts with `min` and alternates with `max`. After reversing, the list `ans` will start with `max` and alternate with `min`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - k, `min` is -100000000 + k, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, but now reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`, `t` is `k`.**
