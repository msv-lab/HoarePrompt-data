Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 3, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to the result of the integer division of the original `x` by 2, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If `x` is odd, `x` remains the same, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]`.**
