#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `i` is the number of test cases - 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (total number of even `x` values encountered across all test cases), `min` is -100000000 + (total number of odd `x` values encountered across all test cases), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x` for the last test case, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for the last `x` to become 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers that, when reversed, forms an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself. If no such sequence can be generated, the function does not handle this case explicitly and will still print a sequence. The elements of the sequence are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the sequence is constructed by decrementing a maximum value for even X and incrementing a minimum value for odd X.
