### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - If no such array exists, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case by reading the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to \( 10^8 \) and \(-10^8 \) respectively, which are within the allowed range.
   - It uses a while loop to construct the array `ans`:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and halves \( X \).
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and decrements \( X \).
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 1.
   - The array `ans` is then reversed to ensure the correct order of elements.
   - The length of the array `t` and the array itself are printed.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Array Length**: The loop runs until \( X \) becomes 1, which means the length of `ans` will be at most \( \log_2(X) \) (for even \( X \)) plus the number of odd \( X \) values encountered. Since \( X \leq 10^{18} \), the maximum length of `ans` will be \( \log_2(10^{18}) \approx 60 \), which is well within the limit of 200.
   - **Range of Elements**: The elements of `ans` are either `max` or `min`, which are initialized to \( 10^8 \) and \(-10^8 \) respectively and are decremented or incremented by 1 in each iteration. This ensures that all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - **Increasing Subsequences**:
     - For even \( X \), appending the largest value `max` and halving \( X \) ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by a factor of 2.
     - For odd \( X \), appending the smallest value `min` and decrementing \( X \) by 1 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by 1.
     - The combination of these operations ensures that the final array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly by appending a single `max` value.
   - The function handles the case where \( X \) is a large number (up to \( 10^{18} \)) by reducing \( X \) through a combination of halving and decrementing, ensuring the array length remains within the limit.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the length of the array `t` and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The logic and the implementation are sound, and the program adheres to the constraints and output format specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
