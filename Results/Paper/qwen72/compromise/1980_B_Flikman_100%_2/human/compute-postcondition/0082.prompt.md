Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 <= t <= 1000, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` remains unchanged. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, no further changes occur. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0. If `removed_count` is not 0 and not equal to `favorite_count`, it remains unchanged but not equal to `favorite_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`k` is the number of iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, and `removed_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it means all occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` are within the first `k` elements. If `removed_count` is 0, it means `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `favorite_count`, indicating that some but not all occurrences of `favorite_value` are within the first `k` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`k` is the input integer, `i` is `k - 1`. If any of the first `k` elements in `sorted_a` are equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is increased by the number of such occurrences. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged. `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it remains unchanged. If `removed_count` is less than `favorite_count`, it may be increased or remain unchanged based on the occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements, but it will not be 0 if it was initially not 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
