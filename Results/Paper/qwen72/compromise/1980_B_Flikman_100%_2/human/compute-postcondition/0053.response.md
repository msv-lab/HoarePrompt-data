Postcondition: ***`k` is the number of iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, and `removed_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is 0, it means that `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `favorite_count`.***
