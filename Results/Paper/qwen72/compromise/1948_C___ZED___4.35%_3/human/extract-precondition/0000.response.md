Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, no arrows point outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
