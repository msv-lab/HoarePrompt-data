Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>', `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If any character at an even index in `b` is not '>', `no_path` is False. If `no_path` is False, and any character at the odd indices from 1 to `n-2` in `a` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` is True. Additionally, `no_path` is False.***
