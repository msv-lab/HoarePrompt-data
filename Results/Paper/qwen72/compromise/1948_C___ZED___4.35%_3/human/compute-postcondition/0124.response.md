The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The precondition describes several variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will simply print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, or `no_path`.

Output: **YES**
