The loop head contains the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function. The other details about the function parameters and constraints (t, n, and the list of tuples) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
