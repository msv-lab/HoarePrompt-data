Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `no_path` is False if the character at index 1 of `a` is not `>`, otherwise `no_path` remains True.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly defined as 3.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `k`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
