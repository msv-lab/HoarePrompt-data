To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>'.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is True, and it indicates that either all characters at even indices in `b` are '>', or all characters at odd indices from 1 to `n-2` in `a` are '>', or both.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print('YES')` is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'YES'.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `no_path` is True, which means that the condition for `no_path` being True is satisfied. This condition is related to the characters in the strings `a` and `b`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement itself does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
