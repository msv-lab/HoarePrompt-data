### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function first checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not '>'. If it is not, it immediately prints 'NO' because the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row if the second-to-last cell does not point to the right.
   - This check is crucial because the robot must be able to move to the last cell in the second row to reach the target.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, so this check is redundant and can be ignored.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path by iterating over the even indices of the second row `b` and the odd indices of the first row `a`.
   - It sets a flag `no_path` to `True` and iterates over the even indices of `b` to see if any of them are not '>'. If any even index in `b` is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it iterates over the odd indices of `a` to see if any of them are not '>'. If any odd index in `a` is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Check for `n == 1`:**
  - The check `if n == 1:` is unnecessary because `n` is always even and at least 2. This can be safely removed.

- **Incorrect Path Logic:**
  - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function assumes that if any even index in `b` or any odd index in `a` is not '>', then the robot cannot reach the target. This is incorrect because the robot can still reach the target if there are other valid paths.
  - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and it must follow the arrows in the current cell. The current logic does not account for all possible movements and only checks specific indices, which is not sufficient to determine if a path exists.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and must reach `(2, n)`.
- The robot can move to the right, left, up, or down, but it cannot skip a move.
- The robot must follow the arrow in the current cell after each move.
- To reach `(2, n)`, the robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the right until it reaches the last column.

### Correctness:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Correctness: **False**
