Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2]`**:
   - The program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `>`. If it is not, it immediately prints `NO`. This check is incorrect because the robot can still reach the cell `(2, n)` even if `b[-2]` is `<`. For example, in the test case:
     ```
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
     The robot can reach `(2, 4)` even though `b[-2]` is `<`.

2. **Handling of `n == 1`**:
   - The program checks if `n == 1` and prints `YES` if true. However, the problem description states that `n` is always even and at least 2, so this check is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. **Path Checking Logic**:
   - The program attempts to check if there is a path by iterating over the grid in steps of 2. However, this logic is flawed:
     - It checks if `b[k]` is not `>` for even indices `k` and sets `no_path` to `False` if any of these checks fail.
     - Then, it checks if `a[k]` is not `>` for odd indices `k` and sets `no_path` to `False` if any of these checks fail.
     - This approach does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and can lead to incorrect conclusions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, you need to simulate the robot's movement step by step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Initialize the robot's starting position
        row = 1
        col = 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        while col < n:
            # First move
            if row == 1:
                if a[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 2
            else:  # row == 2
                if b[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 1
            
            # Second move
            if row == 1:
                if a[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 2
            else:  # row == 2
                if b[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 1
        
        # Check if the robot reached the target cell (2, n)
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

can_reach_end()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)`.
- **Simulation Loop**: The loop continues until the robot reaches the last column (`col < n`).
  - In each iteration, the robot makes two moves:
    - The first move is based on the current row and column.
    - The second move is based on the new row and column after the first move.
- **Check Final Position**: After the loop, the program checks if the robot is at cell `(2, n)`. If so, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

This approach correctly simulates the robot's movement and ensures that the program outputs the correct result for each test case.
