### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character in the current cell and the character is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each query.

3. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the suffix sums of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list to store the results for each query.
   - **Processing the Grid:**
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
     - If the current cell contains '>', it calculates the time based on the number of '>' and '<' characters and their positions.
     - If the current cell contains '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time similarly.
   - **Output:**
     - The results are printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is correctly implemented and used in the main function.
     - It ensures that the index is within the bounds of the list and returns the difference between the last element and the element at the specified position.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is complex but follows the problem's rules.
     - The program correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
     - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the required times for each query.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles cases where the grid is entirely '<' or '>'.
     - It also handles cases where the grid has a mix of '<' and '>', ensuring the pinball leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state at key points.
   - The initialization of `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` is correct.
   - The loop correctly processes each cell from the end to the beginning, updating the necessary lists and calculating the time for each query.
   - The conditions inside the loop handle the different scenarios (when the current cell is '>' or '<') and ensure the correct time is calculated.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures that the calculations are efficient.
   - The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem's constraints.
