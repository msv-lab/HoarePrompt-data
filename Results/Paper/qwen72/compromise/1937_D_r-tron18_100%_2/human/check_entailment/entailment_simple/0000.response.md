### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s1` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The function is used to calculate the cumulative sums of indices in the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists, which are used to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the string `s1` and the length `n` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>', and `preOne` with the cumulative sums of these indices.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element 0 and `ans` as a list of zeros of length `n`.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the cells from right to left.
   - For each cell, it checks if the cell contains '>' or '<'.
   - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
   - If the cell contains '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `suffZero` and `preOne`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the list `ans` for each test case, which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correct Handling of '<' and '>':**
  - The program correctly identifies the direction of movement based on the character in the cell.
  - It inverts the direction after the pinball moves, which is handled implicitly by the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

- **Cumulative Sums:**
  - The use of `accumulate` to create `preOne` and the incremental updates to `suffZero` are appropriate for maintaining the cumulative sums of indices.
  - These cumulative sums are used to efficiently calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid from either the left or the right border.
  - The conditions inside the loop ensure that the pinball's movement and the cumulative sums are adjusted correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules and input constraints. The use of cumulative sums and the handling of the grid's boundaries are appropriate and efficient.
