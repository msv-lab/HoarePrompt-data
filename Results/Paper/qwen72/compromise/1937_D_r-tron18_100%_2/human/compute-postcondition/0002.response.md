Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting only of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, pre is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in s1, totalOne is the number of occurrences of '>' in s1, preOne is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in pre, starting with 0.**

Explanation: The `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module is used to create a list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`) remain unchanged.
