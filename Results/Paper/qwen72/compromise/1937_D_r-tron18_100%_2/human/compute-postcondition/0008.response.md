The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1` and `n`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns the number of pairs of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1` that form a valid sequence, where a valid sequence is defined as a pair where '<' appears before '>'.
