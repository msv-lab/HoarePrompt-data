The variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `len(arr) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `len(arr)` is at least 1, `j` will always be greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that `i <= j` is true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
