Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `q` to determine the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description and the function summary.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases. This is also consistent with the function summary.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. This is correct and matches the problem's input format, as noted in the function summary.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair, as specified in the problem description.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is the correct condition for a peak, as specified in the problem description.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem, as specified in the problem description.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which is consistent with the problem's output format. The function summary confirms that the function only performs print actions based on the conditions and does not return any value.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), it will print "NONE" because neither a stair nor a peak can be formed. This is consistent with the problem description and the function summary.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases. The function summary supports the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
