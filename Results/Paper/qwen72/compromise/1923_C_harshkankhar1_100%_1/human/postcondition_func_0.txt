The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from `input()`. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads `n` integers into an array `a` and initializes another array `b` with the same length. The function computes a cumulative sum for `b` based on the values in `a`, where each element in `b` is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1, otherwise by 2. After computing `b`, the function computes the cumulative sum of `a` and processes `q` queries. For each query, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.
