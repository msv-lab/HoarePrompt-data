The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the user. The first input is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 1000. The next `n` inputs are tuples of three integers each, representing the coordinates and radius of each disk: `x[i]`, `y[i]` are integers such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and `r[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.
