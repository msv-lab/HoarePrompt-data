You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the user. The first input is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 1000. The next `n` inputs are tuples of three integers each, representing the coordinates and radius of each disk: `x[i]`, `y[i]` are integers such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and `r[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if at least one `dfs` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one `dfs` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`. Otherwise, `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` and `n` tuples of coordinates and radii of disks from the user. It returns the number of disks that do not overlap with any other disk.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
