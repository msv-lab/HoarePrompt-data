Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and the next `n` inputs are tuples of three integers each, representing the coordinates and radius of each disk: `x[i]`, `y[i]` are integers such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and `r[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`. `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`. `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`.**
