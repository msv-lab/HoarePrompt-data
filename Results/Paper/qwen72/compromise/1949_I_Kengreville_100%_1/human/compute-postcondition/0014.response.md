Based on the initial state provided:

- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not.
- `tot` is initialized to `0`.
- `bipartite` is initialized to `True`.
- `ok` is `True` because at least one `dfs` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is printing a constant string.

Output: **YES**
