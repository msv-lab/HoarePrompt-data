i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, coef, tot, and bipartite are defined and accessible in the scope where dfs is called. x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the disk centers, respectively, and r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks. visited is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited during the depth-first search, coef is a list of integers (1 or -1) representing the coefficient for each disk, tot is an integer representing the total sum of the coefficients, and bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the disks can be partitioned into two sets such that no two disks in the same set are tangent.
