### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially.
   - For the i-th sign to occur, the year must be a multiple of `a_i`.
   - After the i-th sign occurs, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from the next year, i.e., `start_year + 1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign is expected to occur.
   - The program then iterates through each sign's periodicity `nums[x]`:
     - It updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
     - This is achieved by the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - Finally, it prints the `start_year` for each test case.

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year`.
   - Adding 1 to `k` ensures that the next multiple of `nums[x]` is considered, which is `k * nums[x] + nums[x]`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply return the first multiple of `nums[0]`, which is `nums[0]`.
   - The program also handles the case where all signs have the same periodicity, as it will correctly find the smallest year that is a multiple of all periodicities.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
     - After the second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
     - After the third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
     - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
   - The output is 36, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
     - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
     - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`.
   - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
     - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`.
     - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`.
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`.
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`.
   - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`.
     - After the second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`.
     - After the third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`.
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`.
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`.
     - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`.
   - The output is 2012, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the sequential nature of the signs and their periodicities. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
