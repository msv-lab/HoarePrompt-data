Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the last index of `nums` (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`)**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.
