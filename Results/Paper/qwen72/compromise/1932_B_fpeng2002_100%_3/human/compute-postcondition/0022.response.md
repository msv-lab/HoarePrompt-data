Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`, `x` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
- `start_year` is first divided by `nums[1]` and then incremented by 1 to ensure it is the next multiple.
- This value is then multiplied by `nums[1]` to get the new `start_year`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
