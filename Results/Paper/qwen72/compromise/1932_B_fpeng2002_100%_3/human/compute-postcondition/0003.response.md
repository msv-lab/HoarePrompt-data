Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`**. 

The value of `n` is updated to an input integer, while the other variables `t`, `a`, and `num_tests` remain unchanged.
