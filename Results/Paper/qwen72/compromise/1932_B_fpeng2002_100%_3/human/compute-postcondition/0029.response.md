Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
