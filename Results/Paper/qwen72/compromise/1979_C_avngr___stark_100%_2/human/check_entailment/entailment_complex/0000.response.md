Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it meets the problem description and constraints for all test cases.

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
   \]
   for all \(i\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of the list. The result is the LCM of all the integers in the list.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the list of multipliers \(k\).
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then calculates the bets \(x_i\) for each outcome as \(x_i = \text{LCM} // k_i\).
   - It checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If not, it prints \(-1\).
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and that the condition \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i\) can be satisfied if a solution exists.
   - **Bet Calculation**: \(x_i = \text{LCM} // k_i\) ensures that the bet for each outcome is an integer and is proportional to the LCM.
   - **Sum Check**: The condition `if sum(c) >= m` ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the LCM, which is necessary for the solution to be valid.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case with \(k = [3, 2, 7]\):
     - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
     - Bets are \(x_1 = 42 // 3 = 14\), \(x_2 = 42 // 2 = 21\), \(x_3 = 42 // 7 = 6\).
     - Sum of bets is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than 42.
     - For each outcome:
       - If the first outcome wins, you get \(3 \cdot 14 = 42\) coins.
       - If the second outcome wins, you get \(2 \cdot 21 = 42\) coins.
       - If the third outcome wins, you get \(7 \cdot 6 = 42\) coins.
     - This meets the condition as the sum of bets (41) is strictly less than the LCM (42).

   - For the test case with \(k = [3, 3]\):
     - LCM of 3, 3 is 3.
     - Bets are \(x_1 = 3 // 3 = 1\), \(x_2 = 3 // 3 = 1\).
     - Sum of bets is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than 3.
     - For each outcome:
       - If the first outcome wins, you get \(3 \cdot 1 = 3\) coins.
       - If the second outcome wins, you get \(3 \cdot 1 = 3\) coins.
     - This meets the condition as the sum of bets (2) is strictly less than the LCM (3).

   - For the test case with \(k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\):
     - LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 is 5.
     - Bets are \(x_1 = 5 // 5 = 1\), \(x_2 = 5 // 5 = 1\), \(x_3 = 5 // 5 = 1\), \(x_4 = 5 // 5 = 1\), \(x_5 = 5 // 5 = 1\).
     - Sum of bets is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\), which is not less than 5.
     - Therefore, the program correctly prints \(-1\).

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for all test cases and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
