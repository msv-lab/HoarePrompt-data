### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This can be rearranged to:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the winning outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Strategy:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set the bets in such a way that the bet on the winning outcome is significantly larger than the bets on the other outcomes.
   - A common approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets. This ensures that the bets are large enough to satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
       \[
       \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
       \]
     - This is a correct implementation of the LCM calculation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
     - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively updates the result with the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list.
     - This is also a correct implementation of finding the LCM of a list of numbers.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
     - Calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` using `func_2`.
     - Sets the bet on each outcome `i` to be `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
     - Checks if the total sum of the bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than `m`.
     - If the condition is not satisfied, prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, prints the bets `c`.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided functions are correct for calculating the LCM.
   - The main logic correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome, as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the main logic is missing. The main logic is present and correctly implemented.

Final: **True**
