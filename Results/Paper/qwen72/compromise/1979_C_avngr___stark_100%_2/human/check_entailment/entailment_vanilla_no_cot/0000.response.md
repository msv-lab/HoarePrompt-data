Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but this is not the correct approach to determine the bets for the outcomes.

### What the Problem Requires:
- For each test case, you need to determine a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- This means that for each \( i \), the condition \( \sum_{j=1}^n x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \) must hold.

### What the Program Does:
- The program computes the LCM of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
- However, the LCM is not relevant to the problem of distributing the bets in such a way that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
- One way to solve this problem is to set the bets in such a way that the total bet is just slightly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.
- For example, you can set \( x_i = \frac{1}{k_i - 1} \) for each \( i \), and then scale all bets by a common factor to ensure they are integers and the total bet is less than the minimum return.

### Example Solution:
Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        k = case[1]
        total = sum(1 / (ki - 1) for ki in k)
        if total >= 1:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            scale = 1 / (1 - total)
            x = [int(scale / (ki - 1)) for ki in k]
            results.append(x)
    return results

# Example usage
t = 6
cases = [
    (3, [3, 2, 7]),
    (2, [3, 3]),
    (5, [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]),
    (6, [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]),
    (3, [6, 3, 2]),
    (5, [9, 4, 6, 8, 3])
]

results = solve(cases)
for result in results:
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, and it outputs the correct bets or `-1` if no solution exists.
