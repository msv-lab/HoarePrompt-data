### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This can be rearranged to:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the winning outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Strategy:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set the bets in such a way that the bet on the winning outcome is significantly larger than the bets on the other outcomes.
   - A common approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1` to determine the bets. This ensures that the bets are large enough to satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
       \[
       \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
       \]
     - This is a correct implementation of the LCM calculation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
     - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively updates the result with the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list.
     - This is also a correct implementation of finding the LCM of a list of numbers.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is not provided, but based on the problem description, the main logic should:
     - Calculate the LCM of the list `k_i - 1` for all `i`.
     - Set the bet on each outcome `i` to be the LCM divided by `(k_i - 1)`.
     - Verify that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided functions are correct for calculating the LCM.
   - However, the main logic to distribute the bets and verify the condition is missing, and we need to ensure that the bets are correctly distributed and the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are correct, but the main logic to distribute the bets and verify the condition is missing. Therefore, the program as a whole is incomplete and cannot be determined to be correct based on the given information.

Final: **False**
