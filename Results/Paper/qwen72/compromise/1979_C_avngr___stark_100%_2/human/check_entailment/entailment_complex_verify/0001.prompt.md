You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 1 and b > 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Since both a and b are greater than 1, the result will be a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both greater than 1) and returns the integer result of the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The result is always a positive integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, and the list is non-empty.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: result is equal to the final value returned by the repeated application of func_1 on all integers in the list numbers, starting with the first integer.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value of `result` after applying `func_1` repeatedly on all integers in the list `numbers`, starting with the first integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to all integers in the list, starting with the first integer. The final state of the program is that the returned integer is the cumulative result of the `func_1` applications on the list elements.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This can be rearranged to:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the winning outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Strategy:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set the bets in such a way that the bet on the winning outcome is significantly larger than the bets on the other outcomes.
   - A common approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1` to determine the bets. This ensures that the bets are large enough to satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
       \[
       \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
       \]
     - This is a correct implementation of the LCM calculation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
     - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively updates the result with the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list.
     - This is also a correct implementation of finding the LCM of a list of numbers.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is not provided, but based on the problem description, the main logic should:
     - Calculate the LCM of the list `k_i - 1` for all `i`.
     - Set the bet on each outcome `i` to be the LCM divided by `(k_i - 1)`.
     - Verify that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided functions are correct for calculating the LCM.
   - However, the main logic is missing, and we need to ensure that the bets are correctly distributed and the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are correct, but the main logic to distribute the bets and verify the condition is missing. Therefore, the program as a whole is incomplete and cannot be determined to be correct based on the given information.
