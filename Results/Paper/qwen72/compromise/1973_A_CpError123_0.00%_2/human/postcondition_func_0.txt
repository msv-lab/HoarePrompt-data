The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 if the conditions for calculating ties are not met, or the number of ties (equalities) calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop. The conditions for calculating ties include: the total points (sum of p_1, p_2, and p_3) being even, the total matches (half of total points) being 3 or less, and p_3 not exceeding the total matches. If these conditions are met, the number of ties is calculated and appended to `resultats`; otherwise, -1 is appended.
