Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of matches is greater than 3. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect because the maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is not limited to 3. For example, if the scores are (3, 4, 5), the total points are 12, which means 6 matches were played (since each match awards 2 points). However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case, even though it is a valid set of scores that can be achieved with 6 matches, including 6 draws. The correct condition should be `if p3 > total_matchs:` to ensure that the highest score does not exceed the total number of matches played.
