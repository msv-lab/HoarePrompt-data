### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Validation**:
   - The input `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - The function `func_1` returns a list `resultats` where each element is either -1 or the number of draws (egalites) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.

2. **Key Conditions**:
   - **Total Points Even**: The total points \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
   - **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches played is \( \text{total\_points} // 2 \).
   - **Valid Score Distribution**: The highest score \(p_3\) should not exceed the total number of matches played. This is because each match can only award a maximum of 2 points to a single player.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect because the maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is not limited to 3.
   - The example given is (3, 4, 5), where the total points are 12, meaning 6 matches were played. The program returns -1 for this case, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be `if p3 > total_matchs:` to ensure that the highest score does not exceed the total number of matches played.

5. **Evaluating the Code**:
   - **Case (3, 4, 5)**:
     - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
     - Total matches: \(12 // 2 = 6\)
     - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` evaluates to `True` because `total_matchs` is 6, which is greater than 3. This causes the program to append -1 to `resultats`, which is incorrect.
     - The correct condition `if p3 > total_matchs:` would evaluate to `False` because \(p_3 = 5\) and `total_matchs = 6`, so the program should proceed to calculate the number of draws.
     - Number of draws: \(12 - 2 \times (5 - 4) - 2 \times (5 - 3) = 12 - 2 \times 1 - 2 \times 2 = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6\)
     - The program should return 6 for this case, not -1.

6. **Other Test Cases**:
   - **Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games played, so no draws. Correct output: 0.
   - **Case (0, 1, 1)**: One game ended in a draw. Correct output: 1.
   - **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Total points 5, which is odd. Correct output: -1.
   - **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Total points 9, which is odd. Correct output: -1.
   - **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Total points 12, total matches 6. \(p_3 = 10\) is less than 6, so the condition `if p3 > total_matchs:` would be `False`. Number of draws: \(12 - 2 \times (10 - 1) - 2 \times (10 - 1) = 12 - 18 - 18 = -24\), which is less than 0. Correct output: -1.
   - **Case (0, 0, 6)**: Total points 6, total matches 3. \(p_3 = 6\) is greater than 3, so the condition `if p3 > total_matchs:` would be `True`. Correct output: -1.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is indeed incorrect because it limits the total number of matches to 3, which is not a valid constraint. The correct condition should be `if p3 > total_matchs:`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
