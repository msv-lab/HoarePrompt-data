The function `func` does not accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, the context suggests that there are implicit parameters or inputs, such as `t` and a list of strings `s`, which are used within the function. Given the constraints, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function is intended to operate with an implicit integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and a list of strings `s` (each string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), but the specific output or return value is not provided.**
