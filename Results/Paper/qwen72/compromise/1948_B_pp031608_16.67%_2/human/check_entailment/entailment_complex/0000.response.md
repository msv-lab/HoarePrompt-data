### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If the condition is met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program uses the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list `lst` is equal to its sorted version `sorted_lst`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - The program handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, which cannot be split.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only performs the operation once for each element that meets the condition. This might not be sufficient if multiple operations are needed to sort the array.
   - The program does not handle the case where the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
  - The array is now sorted, so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
  - The program will then split `28` into `[2, 8]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
  - The array is not sorted, so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the output is `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations are needed to sort the array. For example, in the second test case, the program only performs one operation and does not check if further operations are needed to sort the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
