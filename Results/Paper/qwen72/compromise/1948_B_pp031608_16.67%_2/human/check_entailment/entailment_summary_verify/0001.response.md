### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**:
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the list to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `list1` starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the appropriate positions.
   - This logic is intended to simulate the operation described in the problem statement.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the modified array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`. If it is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only checks and modifies the array once per element. However, the problem statement allows for the operation to be performed any number of times. This means that if the array is not sorted after one pass, the program will not attempt to perform additional operations that might be necessary to sort the array.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass or where the array might need to be split multiple times to become sorted.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted. The program will print 'Yes'.
   - For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. It will then split `28` into `[2, 8]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`. The array is still not sorted, and the program will print 'No'.
   - For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the array is already sorted, and the program will print 'Yes'.

However, the program does not correctly handle cases where multiple operations are needed. For example, consider the array `[9, 10, 11]`. The program will not sort this array correctly because it only performs one pass and does not recheck the array after each modification.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the required logic to handle multiple operations as specified in the problem statement. The program only performs one pass through the array and does not re-evaluate the array after each modification, which is necessary to ensure the array can be sorted.

Final: **False**
