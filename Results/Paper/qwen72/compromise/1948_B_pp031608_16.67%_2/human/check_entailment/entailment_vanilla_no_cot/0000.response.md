Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program is incorrect due to several issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if the list is sorted. However, it is called multiple times within the loop, which is inefficient and unnecessary.
   - The program should check if the array can be transformed into a sorted array, not just if it is currently sorted.

2. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to transform the array by splitting elements that are greater than 10 and are out of order. However, it only checks and splits the element at `list1[p - 1]` if it is greater than `list1[p]` and greater than 10.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting `list1[p]` if it is greater than 10 and out of order.
   - Additionally, the transformation logic is applied only once per element, which is insufficient. Elements may need to be split multiple times to achieve a sorted array.

3. **Inefficient and Incomplete Checking**:
   - The program does not check all possible transformations that could lead to a sorted array. It only checks and splits elements in a single pass, which is not enough to determine if the array can be sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider all possible transformations and check if the array can be sorted after each transformation. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Check if the array can be sorted by splitting elements
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] >= 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
            a.pop(i)
            a[i:i] = digits
            if a == sorted(a):
                return True
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`can_be_sorted` Function**:
   - This function checks if the array can be sorted by splitting any element that is greater than or equal to 10.
   - It iterates through each element, splits it into digits if it is greater than or equal to 10, and checks if the resulting array is sorted.
   - If the array becomes sorted after any transformation, it returns `True`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, it reads the input, calls the `can_be_sorted` function, and prints `Yes` if the array can be sorted, otherwise `No`.

This approach ensures that all possible transformations are considered, and the program correctly determines if the array can be sorted.
