### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns. Alice starts first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their own.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that the game is essentially about the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that whatever Alice does, Bob can do the same, ensuring that Bob will always have a move when it's his turn.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will eventually be unable to make a move. Alice can always make the first move to ensure the remaining total is even, and then mirror Bob's moves from there.

3. **Function 1:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is correct based on the optimal play analysis.

4. **Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input format is correctly handled by reading the number of test cases and then the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.
   - The output format is also correct, as it prints the winner for each test case.

### Validation of Annotated Code:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

- **Function 1:**
  - The function correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
  - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
  - The annotations correctly describe the state and the return values.

- **Function 2:**
  - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the `results` list.
  - The annotations correctly describe the state and the behavior of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. Both functions work as expected and handle the input and output correctly.

Final: **True**
