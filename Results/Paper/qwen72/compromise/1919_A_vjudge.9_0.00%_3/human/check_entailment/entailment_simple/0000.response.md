### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because their wallet is empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves. For example, if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin, and if Alice swaps, Bob can swap. Since the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always make the first move, and the parity of the total number of coins will ensure that Bob will be the one who cannot make a move last.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`:**
     - The function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic is correct based on the optimal strategy described above.
   - **Function `func_2()`:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 (as shown in the example).
   - The program also handles the case where `a` and `b` are large (up to \(10^9\)), which is within the constraints.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input and output format matches the problem description.
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case, and prints the results in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
