Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, followed by removing one coin from their wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

To analyze the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic:

1. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice removes a coin, Bob removes a coin. This ensures that Bob will always have a valid move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move, making Bob the winner.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where Bob will be the one who cannot make a move. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob will have an even number of coins, and Alice can mirror Bob's moves from then on. If Alice removes a coin, Bob will have an odd number of coins, and Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the above logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

Given the problem's constraints and the provided solution, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
