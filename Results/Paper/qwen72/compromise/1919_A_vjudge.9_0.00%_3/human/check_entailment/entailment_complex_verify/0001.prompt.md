You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns the string 'Bob'.
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not modify the input variables.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, results is a list containing t elements, each element is the result of the function func_1(a, b) for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The list `results` remains unchanged, and each element in `results` is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then calls another function `func_1` with `a` and `b` as arguments, collects the results in a list `results`, and prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `results` to contain the outcomes of `func_1` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified after their initial input.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns. Alice starts first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their own.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that whatever Alice does, Bob can do the same, ensuring that Bob will always have a move when it's his turn.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will eventually be unable to make a move. Alice can always make the first move to ensure the remaining total is even, and then mirror Bob's moves from there.

3. **Function 1:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is correct based on the optimal play analysis.

4. **Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input format is correctly handled by reading the number of test cases and then the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.
   - The output format is also correct, as it prints the winner for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. Both functions work as expected and handle the input and output correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
