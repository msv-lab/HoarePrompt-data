Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then calls another function `func_1` with `a` and `b` as arguments, collects the results in a list `results`, and prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `results` to contain the outcomes of `func_1` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified after their initial input. **
