The objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and each element is the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. Since `t` is at least 1, `results` will always have at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, for the loop to start, the first element of `results` must be assigned to `result`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `results` is a list with at least one element, and `result` is the first element of `results`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, `result` is the first element of `results`**
