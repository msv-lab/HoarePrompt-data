### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of the water amounts is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - The redistribution is possible if and only if, at any point during the process, no container has less water than the target amount.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the total water and the target amount for each container.
   - Iterate through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If the running sum becomes negative at any point, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount and cannot be balanced by pouring water from a higher-indexed container. Hence, the redistribution is impossible.
   - If the running sum remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the redistribution is possible.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input and splits it into a list.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - It calculates the total water and the target amount for each container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If the running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running sum becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total water and the target amount.
   - It iterates through the containers and maintains a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - It returns 'No' if the running sum becomes negative and 'Yes' otherwise.
   - The function ensures that the variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged, and `container` is 0 after the function concludes.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` (as guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It correctly checks if the running sum of differences becomes negative, which is a valid condition to determine if the redistribution is impossible.
   - The code processes multiple test cases correctly by reading the input in bulk and splitting it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
