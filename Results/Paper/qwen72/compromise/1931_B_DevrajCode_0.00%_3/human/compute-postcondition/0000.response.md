Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.** 

The variable `total_water` is now assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `a`. The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water` holds this sum. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
