Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cows with ratings less than or equal to your cow's rating that can be placed before your cow, either without swapping or by swapping one cow. The function does not return any value. The state of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
