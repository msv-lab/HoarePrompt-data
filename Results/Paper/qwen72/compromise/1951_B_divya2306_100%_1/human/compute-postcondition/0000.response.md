Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The list `a` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer, which is between 2 and 10^5.
- `k` is assigned the second integer, which is between 1 and `n`.
- The list `a` and the number of test cases `t` are not affected by this code, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
