Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a grid of size \( n \times n \) to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually by reading \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \)**: If \( k = 1 \), the program correctly prints 1, as coloring just one cell will ensure that at least one diagonal has a colored cell.

3. **General Case for \( k \leq 2n \)**: If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is correct because in a \( n \times n \) grid, you can color cells along the main diagonals (both the primary and secondary diagonals) to cover up to \( 2n \) diagonals. Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, so the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Case for \( k > 2n \)**: If \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \), the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is correct because after covering the \( 2n \) diagonals with \( \lceil 2n / 2 \rceil = n \) cells, you need to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, so the number of additional cells needed is \( \lceil (k - 2n) / 2 \rceil \). Since \( k - 2n \) is always even or odd, \( \lceil (k - 2n) / 2 \rceil \) simplifies to \( (k - 2n) // 2 + 1 \). Adding this to the \( n \) cells already used gives \( n + (k - 2n) // 2 + 1 = k // 2 + 1 \).

The program handles all the cases correctly and efficiently, ensuring that the minimum number of cells is printed for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
