### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Cases to Consider:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to ensure that at least one diagonal contains a colored cell. This is straightforward and the program correctly prints 1.
   - **Case 2: \( k \leq 2n \)**
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells along the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) to cover the required number of diagonals. Each cell colored along these diagonals can cover up to 2 diagonals. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). The program correctly uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to handle this case.
   - **Case 3: \( k > 2n \)**
     - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals than the main diagonals can handle. We can color cells along the main diagonals to cover \( 2n \) diagonals, and then we need to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, but since we are already covering \( 2n \) diagonals, the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals can be covered by \( \lceil (k - 2n) / 2 \rceil \) cells. However, the program simplifies this to \( k // 2 + 1 \), which is correct because it ensures that we cover the remaining diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
     - The program prints `2`, which is correct because we can color 2 cells to cover 4 diagonals.
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
     - The program prints `2`, which is correct because we can color 2 cells to cover 3 diagonals.
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
     - The program prints `6`, which is correct because we need to color 6 cells to cover all 10 diagonals.
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
     - The program prints `5`, which is correct because we need to color 5 cells to cover 9 diagonals.
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
     - The program prints `4`, which is correct because we can color 4 cells to cover 7 diagonals.
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
     - The program prints `6`, which is correct because we need to color 6 cells to cover 11 diagonals.
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
     - The program prints `2`, which is correct because we can color 2 cells to cover 3 diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
