Reasoning:  
The program provided is almost correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined as `def func():` instead of `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):`. While this doesn't affect the correctness of the logic, it does not match the problem description, which suggests a more descriptive function name.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells to Color**:
   - When `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because coloring a single cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
   - When `k <= 2 * n`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, you can color cells in such a way that each pair of cells covers two diagonals. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - When `k > 2 * n`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because after coloring `2 * n` cells to cover the first `2 * n` diagonals, each additional cell will cover two more diagonals. Thus, the remaining `k - 2 * n` diagonals will require `(k - 2 * n) // 2` additional cells, plus one more cell to ensure the last diagonal is covered.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is greater than `2 * n` correctly, ensuring that the minimum number of cells is calculated accurately.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case, which matches the expected results in the example.

Given these points, the logic and output of the program are correct, but the function name does not match the problem description. However, since the function name does not affect the correctness of the logic, we can still consider the program correct in terms of its functionality.

Correctness: **True**
