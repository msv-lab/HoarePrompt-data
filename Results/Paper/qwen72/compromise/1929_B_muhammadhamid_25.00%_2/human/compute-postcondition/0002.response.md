The function `min_cells_to_color` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to achieve a specific pattern based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2. It returns the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.**
