### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the bitwise XOR of these integers.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.
   - Eve can remove one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)) will help in achieving this.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Each pair of the same number will contribute to making the XOR zero.
   - The number of pairs for each number \( p_i \) is \( \lfloor p_i / 2 \rfloor \).

6. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - If all counts \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \) are odd, removing one number from each will make the XOR zero.
   - This is because the XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s will be non-zero, but removing one from each will make the counts even, resulting in a zero XOR.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the number of pairs for each count to `cnt` using `math.floor(x / 2)`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all counts are odd by adding 1 to `cnt`.
   - It correctly counts the number of pairs for each count.
   - The total count `cnt` represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
