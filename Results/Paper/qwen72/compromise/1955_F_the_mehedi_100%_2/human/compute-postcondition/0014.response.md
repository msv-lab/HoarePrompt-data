The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and is incremented by the loop, we focus on the condition for the loop to execute again, which is determined by the result of `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`

For the loop to execute one more time, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`, which is 0. After the loop increments `_`, `_` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`**
