Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `cnt` Calculation**:
   - The variable `cnt` is defined as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - `math.floor(x / 2)` means the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.
   - For each element `x` in the list `a`, `math.floor(x / 2)` will be calculated and then all these values will be summed to get `cnt`.

2. **Output**:
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given formula. The output will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`)**
