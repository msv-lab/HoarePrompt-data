Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is `1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is `3 * math.floor(x / 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- If the first three elements of `a` are all odd, `cnt` was initially `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` was initially `2 * math.floor(x / 2)`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `3 * math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
