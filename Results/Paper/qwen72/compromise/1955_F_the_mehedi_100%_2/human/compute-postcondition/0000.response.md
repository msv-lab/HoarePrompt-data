The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop depends on the input value provided to `range()`. For the loop to execute, the input value must be at least 1. The state of `t` and `p_i` are not directly in the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the input value should be consistent with the description of `t`, which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input to `range` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `t`**
