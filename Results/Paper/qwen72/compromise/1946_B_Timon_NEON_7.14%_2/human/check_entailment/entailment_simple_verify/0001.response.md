### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing it, and inserting the sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, there are several issues:
       - The `new_segment` list is initialized as an empty list, but it is used as if it were a list with two elements. This will cause an `IndexError` when trying to access `new_segment[0]`.
       - The `max_segment` list is initialized as `[0, 0]`, but it is updated in a way that does not always maintain the correct structure. Specifically, `max_segment[0]` is used to accumulate the sum, but the second element (index) is not updated correctly.
       - The `segments_variants` list is used to store potential segments, but it is not clear how these segments are used to determine the maximum sum.
       - The function returns a segment, but the problem requires the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, not a segment.

   - **Main Program:**
     - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum segment sum.
     - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
     - It calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The formula used to calculate the answer is incorrect. The correct approach should involve finding the maximum subarray sum and then using this sum to maximize the total sum after `k` operations.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program as provided does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The `func_2` function is flawed and does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - The main program's formula for calculating the final answer is incorrect.
   - The `func_3` function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The `func_2` function is incorrect, and the main program's formula for calculating the final answer is flawed. A correct solution would need to properly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then use this information to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

Final: **False**
