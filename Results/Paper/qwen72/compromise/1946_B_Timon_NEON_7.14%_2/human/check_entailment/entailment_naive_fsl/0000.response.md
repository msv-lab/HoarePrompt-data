Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the overall logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations is missing. Additionally, the logic in `func_2` for finding the maximum segment sum is flawed and does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative numbers or arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers where the optimal subarray might not be contiguous. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
-1 2 -1
```
The program does not correctly handle this case, as it does not have the logic to determine the maximum possible sum after performing the operations. The expected output should be `4` (by selecting the subarray `[2]` and inserting its sum twice), but the program does not produce this result.
