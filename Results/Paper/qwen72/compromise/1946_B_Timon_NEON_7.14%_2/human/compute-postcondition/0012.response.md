Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a segment of `arr` that was considered as a potential maximum segment, and now includes an additional sublist which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1], and the length of `total_max_segment` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `total_max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`, len(arr) - 1] and its length is 1.
- The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` reassigns `total_max_segment` to a new list containing only the value -1.
- The length of `total_max_segment` remains 1 after the reassignment.
- All other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
