Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a segment of `arr` that was considered as a potential maximum segment, and now includes an additional sublist which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new sublist to `segments_variants`.
- This new sublist is `max_segment` plus a list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`.
- The values of `new_segment` and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The value of `max_segment` remains the same, but the `segments_variants` list now includes an additional sublist.
