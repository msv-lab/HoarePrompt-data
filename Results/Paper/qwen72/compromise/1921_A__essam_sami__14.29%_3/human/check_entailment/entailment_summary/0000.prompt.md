Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)





# Execution Summary:
The function reads a series of test cases from the user input, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of two squares. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between the corresponding corners of the two squares and prints the minimum of these squared distances. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
