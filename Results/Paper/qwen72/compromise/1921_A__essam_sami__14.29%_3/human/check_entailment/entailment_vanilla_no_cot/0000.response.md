Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then selects the smaller of the two values to print as the area. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. It does not ensure that the points being used to calculate the distance are actually adjacent corners of the square.
2. The area of a square is the side length squared, and the side length can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

A correct approach would involve identifying the side length of the square by finding the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two points that are adjacent corners, and then squaring that difference to get the area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points to find the side length easily
        points.sort()
        
        # The side length can be found by the difference in x or y coordinates
        # of the first two points (since they are sorted, they are adjacent)
        side_length = points[1][0] - points[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the area of the square for each test case.
