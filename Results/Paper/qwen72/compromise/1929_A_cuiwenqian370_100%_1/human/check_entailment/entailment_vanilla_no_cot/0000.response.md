Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it. However, the problem requires the maximum beauty of the array, which is not necessarily achieved by sorting the array in ascending order.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the beauty should be calculated as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, without taking the absolute value. This is because the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of the differences, not the sum of the absolute differences.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

Additionally, the `func_2` function reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. It would be better to read each test case one by one. Here is a more appropriate way to handle input:

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

However, a more readable and idiomatic way to handle input would be:

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly solve the problem as described.
