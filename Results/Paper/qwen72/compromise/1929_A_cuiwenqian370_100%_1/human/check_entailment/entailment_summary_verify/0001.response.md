### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to maximize this beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The use of `abs` in the beauty calculation is incorrect. The problem requires the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value, which means we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

3. **Optimal Approach:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest elements at the beginning and the largest elements at the end.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

4. **Function 1 Correction:**
   - The function `func_1(array)` should not use `abs` when calculating the beauty.
   - The correct calculation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(array):
         array.sort()
         beauty = 0
         for i in range(1, len(array)):
             beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
         return beauty
     ```

5. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(array)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result.
   - The input handling and test case processing in `func_2()` are correct.

6. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2()` is correct. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the length \(n\) and the array elements.

7. **Output:**
   - The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
- The current implementation of `func_1(array)` is incorrect because it uses `abs` in the beauty calculation, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).
- The input handling and test case processing in `func_2()` are correct.

### Correctness:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the use of `abs` in `func_1(array)`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
