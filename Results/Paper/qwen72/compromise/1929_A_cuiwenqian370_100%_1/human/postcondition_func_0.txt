The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` (with a length between 2 and 100, and each element between 1 and 10^9) and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The original `array` is sorted in-place, and the variable `beauty` holds the computed sum.
