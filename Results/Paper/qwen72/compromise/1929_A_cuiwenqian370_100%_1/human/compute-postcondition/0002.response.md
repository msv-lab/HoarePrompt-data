Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t`, followed by the input for `t` test cases. Each test case input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The `data` list is updated to contain the split input values.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is now the integer representation of the first element in the `data` list.
- The rest of the `data` list remains unchanged, containing the split input values for the `t` test cases.
- The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500 and the structure of `data` are still valid.
