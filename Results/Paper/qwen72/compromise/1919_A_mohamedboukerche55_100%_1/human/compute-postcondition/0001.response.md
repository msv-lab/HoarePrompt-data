The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 <= t <= 1000, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
