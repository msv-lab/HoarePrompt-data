Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the function execution. **
