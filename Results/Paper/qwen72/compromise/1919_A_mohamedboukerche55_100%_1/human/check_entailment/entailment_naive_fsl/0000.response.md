Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, the game's outcome depends on the specific values of `a` and `b` and the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make.

For example, consider the test case where `a = 2` and `b = 1`:
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
- Bob then has to remove 1 coin from his wallet, making `b = 1`.
- Alice can now remove 1 coin from her wallet, making `a = 0`.
- Bob is forced to swap wallets with Alice, making `a = 1` and `b = 0`.
- Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet, making `a = 0`.
- Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the program would incorrectly output "Bob" because `(2 + 1) % 2 == 0` is `True`, which does not match the expected outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
