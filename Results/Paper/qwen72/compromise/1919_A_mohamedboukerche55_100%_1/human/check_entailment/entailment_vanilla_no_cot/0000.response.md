Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. However, this does not correctly model the game's rules, where the players can choose to swap wallets or keep their own, and the game continues until one player cannot make a move.

To correctly determine the winner, you need to consider the following:
- If both players have an equal number of coins, the game will always end in a situation where the player whose turn it is will lose, because they will eventually be forced to make a move that results in both wallets being empty.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the other player loses.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the game's rules. If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Bob will win because they will eventually be forced into a losing position. If they have a different number of coins, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
