Reasoning:  
The logic implemented in the program is based on the observation that the game is essentially about parity (even or odd). The key insight is that the total number of moves that can be made by both players is `a + b - 1` because each player must always remove one coin from their wallet, and the game ends when one of the wallets is empty. 

- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, then the total number of moves (`a + b - 1`) is odd. This means that Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be the one who cannot make a move after Bob's last move, so Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, then the total number of moves (`a + b - 1`) is even. This means that Alice will make the last move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a move after Alice's last move, so Alice wins.

The program correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and prints the winner based on the parity. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
