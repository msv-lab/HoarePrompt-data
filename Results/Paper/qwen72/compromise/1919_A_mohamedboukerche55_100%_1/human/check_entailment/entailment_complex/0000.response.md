### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns and perform specific actions. The key to determining the winner is understanding the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob will always win because the game will end in a state where both wallets have an even number of coins, and Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, Alice will always win because the game will end in a state where one wallet has an odd number of coins and the other has an even number of coins, and Alice will be the last to make a move.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The program checks the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles larger values of `a` and `b` correctly, as the logic is based on the parity of the sum, which is consistent for all valid inputs.

5. **Output:**
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
