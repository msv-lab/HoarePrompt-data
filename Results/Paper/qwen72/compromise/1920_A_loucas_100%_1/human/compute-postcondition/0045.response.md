The code snippet `num -= 1` decreases the value of `num` by 1. According to the initial state, `num` is only decreased by 1 if `i` (which is the second element of the non-empty list `no`) is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`. If these conditions are not met, `num` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state does not specify whether `i` meets the condition, we assume that the condition is met, and `num` is indeed decreased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is the second element of the non-empty list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.**
