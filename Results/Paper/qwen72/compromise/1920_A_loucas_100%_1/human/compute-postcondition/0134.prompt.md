Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is now an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 0, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is an empty list if `x` is not 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `less` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are the new integers provided by user input, `big` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 1. If `x` is not 1, `less` and `no` may contain `[a, a]` instead of `[a]` if they were initially `[a]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer provided by user input, `a` is the second integer provided by user input, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is `[a, a]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
