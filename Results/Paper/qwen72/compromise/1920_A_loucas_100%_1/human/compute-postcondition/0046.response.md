The code snippet `num -= 1` unconditionally decreases the value of `num` by 1. The conditions mentioned in the initial state do not affect the execution of this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `num` is decreased by 1, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of the non-empty list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is now decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is also decreased by 1.**
