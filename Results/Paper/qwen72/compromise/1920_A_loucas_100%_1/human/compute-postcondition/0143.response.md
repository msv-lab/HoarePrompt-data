Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `no`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and `innerLoop` is the input integer. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then the current iteration of the loop continues. If `num` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration.***
