Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 0, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is an empty list, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 0. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the last integer provided by user input, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.***
