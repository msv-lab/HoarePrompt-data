The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints. The function accepts an implicit set of inputs for each test case, which includes:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of constraints, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
  - A list of constraints, each represented by a pair `(a, x)`, where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Given the constraints, the function is expected to return a solution that satisfies the given constraints for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, and a list of constraints `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer. The function returns a solution for each test case that satisfies the given constraints.**
