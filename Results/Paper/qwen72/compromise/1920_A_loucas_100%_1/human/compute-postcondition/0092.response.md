Postcondition: **`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `no`, and `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**
