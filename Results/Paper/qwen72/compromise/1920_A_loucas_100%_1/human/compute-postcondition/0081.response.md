Output State: **`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are updated to the new integers provided by user input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `big` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 1 or 2, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing `[a]`.**
