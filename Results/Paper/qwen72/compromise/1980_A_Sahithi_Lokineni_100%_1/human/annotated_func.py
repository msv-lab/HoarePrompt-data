#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. It has no side effects on any input variables or the program state.
