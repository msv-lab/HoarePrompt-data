Output State: **The loop iterates `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads two lines of input: an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It then processes the list `N` to determine the value of `cur` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case. The variables `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset or updated within each iteration, but their values are not carried over to the next iteration. The variable `T` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the loop terminates when `T` reaches 0.**
