You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It then processes the list `N` to determine the value of `cur` based on specific conditions and prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the final values of `cur` for each test case have been printed. The variables `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset or updated within each iteration, and their values are not carried over to the next iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 2 2

Expected Output:
3
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial array `a`:** [0, 1, 2, 2]
- **Optimal Play:**
  1. Alice picks 2. `a = [0, 1, 2]`, `c = [2]`.
  2. Bob picks 0. `a = [1, 2]`, `c = [2]`.
  3. Alice picks 1. `a = [2]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
  4. Bob picks 2. `a = []`, `c = [2, 1]`.

- **Final array `c`:** [2, 1]
- **MEX of `c`:** 3 (since 0, 1, and 2 are present, but 3 is not).

### Program Output:
The program will output `2` instead of `3`.

### Reason:
The program incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the counts of unique elements in `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`, then the MEX should be incremented by 1. This logic does not correctly handle the scenario where the array contains duplicate elements that are not the smallest missing integer. The program should consider the optimal strategy for both players, which involves Alice and Bob making decisions based on the smallest missing integer and the presence of duplicates.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Sort the array `N`.
2. Track the smallest integer that is not present in the array.
3. Consider the optimal moves for Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks the smallest missing integer if possible, and Bob picks the smallest integer that is not the smallest missing integer if possible.

This approach would correctly handle all edge cases and ensure the optimal MEX is found.
