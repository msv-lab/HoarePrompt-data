### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

3. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - **Step 1:** Iterate through the sorted array `N` and update `cur` and `M`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - **Step 2:** Check if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`.
     - If true, increment `cur` by 1.
   - **Step 3:** Collect all keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - **Step 4:** If there are at least two such keys, set `cur` to the second smallest key.
   - **Step 5:** Print the final value of `cur`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The program correctly sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It correctly updates `cur` and `M` to track the smallest missing integer.
   - However, the logic for handling the dictionary `M` and the final MEX calculation is flawed:
     - The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob can prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
     - The program incorrectly assumes that the second smallest key in `M` with a count of 1 is the final MEX, which is not always true.
     - The program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, especially Bob's role in minimizing the MEX.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob should play optimally, meaning Alice should always try to pick the smallest available number that Bob has not picked, and Bob should try to pick the smallest available number that Alice has not picked.
   - The correct approach is to simulate the game by alternating turns and keeping track of the numbers picked by both players.
   - The final MEX can be determined by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements are picked.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and has logical flaws in determining the final MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
