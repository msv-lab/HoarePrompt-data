### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good first step to facilitate the MEX calculation.

3. **Tracking the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1 and is used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` based on the conditions:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After processing the array, the function checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.
  - By sorting the array and tracking the counts, the function aims to find the point where the MEX can be determined.

- **Conditions for MEX:**
  - The function correctly identifies the MEX by breaking the loop when it finds a gap in the sequence of numbers.
  - However, the logic for updating `cur` after the loop and the use of `cnt` seems to be an attempt to handle edge cases, but it is not clear if this is the most optimal way to determine the MEX.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
  - The logic for updating `cur` after the loop and using `cnt` is not correct. The MEX should be determined by the first missing integer in the sequence, not by the second element in `cnt`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when all elements are the same or when the array is already complete.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the MEX calculation and the handling of edge cases, the provided program is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
