Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 2 2

Expected Output:
3
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial array `a`:** [0, 1, 2, 2]
- **Optimal Play:**
  1. Alice picks 2. `a = [0, 1, 2]`, `c = [2]`.
  2. Bob picks 0. `a = [1, 2]`, `c = [2]`.
  3. Alice picks 1. `a = [2]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
  4. Bob picks 2. `a = []`, `c = [2, 1]`.

- **Final array `c`:** [2, 1]
- **MEX of `c`:** 3 (since 0, 1, and 2 are present, but 3 is not).

### Program Output:
The program will output `2` instead of `3`.

### Reason:
The program incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the counts of unique elements in `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`, then the MEX should be incremented by 1. This logic does not correctly handle the scenario where the array contains duplicate elements that are not the smallest missing integer. The program should consider the optimal strategy for both players, which involves Alice and Bob making decisions based on the smallest missing integer and the presence of duplicates.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Sort the array `N`.
2. Track the smallest integer that is not present in the array.
3. Consider the optimal moves for Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks the smallest missing integer if possible, and Bob picks the smallest integer that is not the smallest missing integer if possible.

This approach would correctly handle all edge cases and ensure the optimal MEX is found.
