### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from an array `a` and Alice constructs an array `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integer by removing it from `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the array `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - It then creates a list `cntl` of length `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is 0. If 0 is not in the array `a`, the MEX of `c` will be 0, and the program prints 0. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and 0 is the smallest non-negative integer.

5. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
     - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not in the array.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is correctly calculated.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` is called with no arguments.
  - It should handle multiple test cases internally.

- **Reading Input:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The program initializes a list `cntl` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
  - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and stores them in `cntl`.

- **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
  - If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program prints 0. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and 0 is the smallest non-negative integer.

- **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
  - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
  - It then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
    - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
    - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It accurately calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules and constraints.
