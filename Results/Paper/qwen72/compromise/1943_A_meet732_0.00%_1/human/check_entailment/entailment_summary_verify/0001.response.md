### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` by removing it from `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then creates a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not in the array `a`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be 0, and the program prints 0. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and the smallest non-negative integer not in `c` is 0.

5. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
     - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not in the array.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is correctly calculated.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
  - It correctly increments the count for each integer in `a`.

- **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
  - If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program prints 0, which is correct because 0 is not in `a` and thus cannot be in `c`.

- **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
  - The program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is correct because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
  - The program iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
    - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
    - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
  - Since `cntl[0]` is 2, `c` is initialized to 2.
  - For `j = 1`, `cntl[1]` is 2, so `c` remains 2.
  - For `j = 2`, `cntl[2]` is 0, so `c` is decreased by 1 to 1.
  - For `j = 3`, `cntl[3]` is 0, so `c` is decreased by 1 to 0.
  - The program prints `2` and breaks the loop, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Since `cntl[0]` is 1, `c` is initialized to 1.
  - For `j = 1`, `cntl[1]` is 1, so `c` is decreased by 1 to 0.
  - The program prints `1` and breaks the loop, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[0, 2]`
  - Since `cntl[0]` is 0, the program prints `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It accurately calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules and constraints.
