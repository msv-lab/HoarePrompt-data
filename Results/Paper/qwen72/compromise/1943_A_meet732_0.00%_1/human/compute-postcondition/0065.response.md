Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` is 2, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `j`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
