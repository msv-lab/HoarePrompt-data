The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `a`, and the list `cntl` initially has a 1 at index `i` and 0s elsewhere. After the increment, the value at index `i` in `cntl` will be 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `j`, and `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `j` and `c` are not affected, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
