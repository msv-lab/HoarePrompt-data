Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, so the element at index `i` in the list `cntl` is now 1.
- All other elements in `cntl` remain 0.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` are unchanged.
