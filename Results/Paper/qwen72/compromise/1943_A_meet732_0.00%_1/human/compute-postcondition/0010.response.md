Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, and the list `a` remains the list of integers input by the user. The list `cntl` is now a list of length `n + 1`, where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any integer in `a` remain 0.
