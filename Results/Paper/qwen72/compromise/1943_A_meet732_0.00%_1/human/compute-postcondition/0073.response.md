Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, `j` and `c` are not affected. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `n`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks, and the value of `j` is printed.***
