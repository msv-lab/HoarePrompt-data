Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
2. `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user.
3. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
4. `cntl[0]` is not 0.
5. `j` is 2.
6. `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1.
7. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1.
8. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `c`**:
   - `c` is defined as the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1.
   - Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, let's consider the possible values of `cntl[0]`:
     - If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c = min(2, 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.
     - If `cntl[0]` is 2 or greater, then `c = min(2, cntl[0]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.

2. **Check the condition for `c`**:
   - If `c` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
   - If `c` is 1, we proceed to the next step.

3. **Check the condition for `cntl[j]`**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - If `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1.
   - If `c` becomes 0 after this decrease, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Determine the final value of `c`**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is 1, `c` is 0, and the loop is exited immediately.
   - If `cntl[0]` is 2 or greater, `c` is 1. Then, if `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` becomes 0, and the loop is exited.

5. **Check the condition for `j`**:
   - If `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
   - Since `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0, `j` will not be equal to `n` unless `n` is exactly 2.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `j` is 2.
- The value of `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial value of `cntl[0]` and the value of `cntl[2]`.
- The loop or if statement will exit if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` equals `n`.

Since the `print(j)` statement is executed, and `j` is explicitly set to 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
