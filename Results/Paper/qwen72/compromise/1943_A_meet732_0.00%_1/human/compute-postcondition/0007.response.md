The value at index `i` in the list `cntl` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, the element at this index in `cntl` is now 2. The other elements in `cntl` remain unchanged, with the element at index `i` being 2 and all other elements being 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**
