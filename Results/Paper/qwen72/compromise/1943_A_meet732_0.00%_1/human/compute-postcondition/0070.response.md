Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` is 3, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is `c - 1`. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
