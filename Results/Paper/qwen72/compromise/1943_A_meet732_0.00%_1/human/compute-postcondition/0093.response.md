Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1.
   - Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.
   - Additionally, `cntl[j]` is less than 2.

2. **Determine the value of `c`:**
   - `c` is defined as `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1`.
   - Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, it can be any positive integer.
   - If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c = min(2, 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is 2 or greater, then `c = min(2, cntl[0]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.

3. **Determine the value of `j`:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - The condition states that either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.
   - If `c` is 0, then the condition is satisfied regardless of the value of `j`.
   - If `c` is 1, then `j` must be equal to `n` to satisfy the condition.

4. **Check the condition `cntl[j] < 2`:**
   - Since `j` is 1, we need to check `cntl[1]`.
   - The condition `cntl[j] < 2` means that the integer 1 appears less than 2 times in the list `a`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `j` is 1 and the condition `cntl[j] < 2` is true, `j` will be printed as 1.

Output: **1**
