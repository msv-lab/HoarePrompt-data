Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0, otherwise `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`, `i` is the first element in `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `a`.
- Since `i` is the first element in `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cntl[i]` changes from 0 to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
