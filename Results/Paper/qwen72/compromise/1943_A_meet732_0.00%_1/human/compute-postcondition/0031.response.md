Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
2. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
3. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
4. `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
5. `j` is 3.
6. `c` is decreased by 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 3 in the initial state.
- The print statement `print(j)` will simply output the value of `j`.

### Output:
Output: **3**
