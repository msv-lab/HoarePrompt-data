The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is being iterated over the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `a` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be the second element in `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0, otherwise `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`, `i` is the second element in `a`**
