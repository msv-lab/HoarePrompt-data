The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `c`, so we can only state that `c` is decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1.**
