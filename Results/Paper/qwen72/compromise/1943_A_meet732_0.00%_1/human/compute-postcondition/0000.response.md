The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases.

Since the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases internally, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer, indicating that there are test cases to process.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
