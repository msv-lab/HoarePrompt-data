### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.

2. **Transformation of Input:**
   - The line `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` is intended to convert each count to the nearest even number. However, this transformation is not necessary for solving the problem and may lead to incorrect results. The original counts should be used to determine the number of times Bob can win.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The winning condition for Bob is that the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers should be zero.
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the total number of odd numbers in the sequence is even.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - The key observation is that removing an odd number (1 or 3) changes the parity of the XOR, while removing an even number (2 or 4) does not.

5. **Calculation:**
   - The line `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)` is intended to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - The expression `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if the first three elements of `p` (after transformation) are all odd. This is incorrect because the transformation to even numbers has already been applied.
   - The expression `sum(p) // 2` is intended to count the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed, but it is based on the transformed values, which is not correct.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach should be to count the number of 1s and 3s (odd numbers) and 2s and 4s (even numbers) separately.
- Bob wins if the number of 1s and 3s is even. Eve should remove numbers to maintain this condition as much as possible.
- The maximum number of times Bob can win is the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed plus one if the initial sequence has an even number of 1s and 3s.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the number of odd and even numbers
        odd_count = p[0] + p[2]
        even_count = p[1] + p[3]
        
        # Bob wins if the number of odd numbers is even
        # The maximum number of times Bob can win is the number of pairs plus one if the initial count is even
        max_wins = even_count + (odd_count // 2) + (odd_count % 2 == 0)
        
        print(max_wins)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it applies an unnecessary transformation to the input and uses a flawed logic to determine the number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **False**
