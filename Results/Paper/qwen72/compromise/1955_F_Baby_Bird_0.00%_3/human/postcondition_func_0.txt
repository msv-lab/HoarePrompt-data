The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list `p` of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) from user input. The function then calculates and prints the sum of the number of odd values among the first three elements of `p` (which can be 0 or 3) and the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.
