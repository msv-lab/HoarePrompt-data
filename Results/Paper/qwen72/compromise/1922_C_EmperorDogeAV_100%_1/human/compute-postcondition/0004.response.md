Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of integers in strictly ascending order, and `n`, an integer representing the number of cities in the list. The function returns a new list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers, where each integer is the minimum of either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, or the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city. The original list `cities` remains unchanged.**
