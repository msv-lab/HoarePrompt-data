The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should be called with two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Since the function's parameters and return value are not clearly defined in the provided code snippet, we can only infer that the function is intended to work with two distinct non-negative integers within the specified range, but the exact functionality (what it returns) is unknown.

Functionality: **The function is intended to work with two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, but the specific return value based on these inputs is not provided.**
