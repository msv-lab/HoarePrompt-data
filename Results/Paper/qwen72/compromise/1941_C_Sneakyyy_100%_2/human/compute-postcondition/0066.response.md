Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive). If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
