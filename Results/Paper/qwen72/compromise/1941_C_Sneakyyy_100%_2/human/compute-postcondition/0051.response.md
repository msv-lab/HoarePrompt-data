Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 3 and `i` is 6. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 7, `ans` is 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' and `i-1` is 4, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' and `i-1` is not 4, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6 or 7, greater than 4 if `i` is 5, and greater than 5 if `i` is 3.***
