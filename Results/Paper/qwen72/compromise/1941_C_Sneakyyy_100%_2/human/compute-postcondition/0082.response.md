The function `func` is described with specific parameter constraints but the function signature provided does not include any parameters. However, based on the constraints and relationships given, the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, but given the context, it is likely that the function processes the string `s` in some way that is relevant to the test case `t`.

Since the output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the parameters and the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of a string), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The function processes the string `s` for each test case and returns a result based on the processing of `s`.**
