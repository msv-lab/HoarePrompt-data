Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, and `len(a)` must be greater than `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is updated to either 9, 7, or 5, and `ans` is updated to either 3, 2, or 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to either 7, 5, or 3, and `ans` remains either 2, 1, or 0.***
