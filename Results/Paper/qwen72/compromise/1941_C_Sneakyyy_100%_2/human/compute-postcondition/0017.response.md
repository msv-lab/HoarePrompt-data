Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `i` is 4 if `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4.
- Otherwise, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2.
- The value of `s` is now the substring of `a` from the new `i` to `i + 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
