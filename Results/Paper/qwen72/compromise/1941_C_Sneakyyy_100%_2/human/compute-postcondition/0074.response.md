Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 8, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive), `ans` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially, and `i` is 2 or 4 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially. `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 6.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 6 is still valid.
- The value of `s` is now the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`.
- The values of `ans` and `i` depend on the initial values of `s`, which remain as specified in the initial state.
