Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

The value of `i` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `_` still hold true.
