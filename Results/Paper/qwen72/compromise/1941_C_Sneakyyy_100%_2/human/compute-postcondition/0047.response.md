Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 3, otherwise if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 4, `ans` is 1, if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3 or 4, or greater than 4 if `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is assigned the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.
- The initial state specifies the conditions for `ans` and `i` based on the value of `s`.
- The conditions for `len(a)` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
