The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which means `t` is a valid input for the loop to execute at least once.

However, the state provided does not explicitly mention that `t` is the input to the `range` function. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is the value that will be passed to `range`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
