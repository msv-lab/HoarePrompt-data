Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive). If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.***
