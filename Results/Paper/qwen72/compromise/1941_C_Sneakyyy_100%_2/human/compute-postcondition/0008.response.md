Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive), `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 0, `i` is 3.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so `i` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
