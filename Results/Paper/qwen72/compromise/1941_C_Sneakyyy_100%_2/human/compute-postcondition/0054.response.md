The loop head in this case is only dependent on the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(int(input()))` loop. The state of `_` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a new input string
- `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`
- `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less

Since `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can infer that it is the loop counter that has been incremented. The loop will execute one more time if `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- The loop will execute again if `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`**
