### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells per screen).
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function returns the smaller of two values. It is not directly used in the main logic but could be useful for other parts of the program.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
     - It calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct because each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons.
     - It then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This formula is intended to adjust `x` by subtracting the number of cells used by the 2x2 icons and adding back the cells that were freed up by placing the 2x2 icons.
     - If the updated `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` and prints the total number of screens.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` `t` times, which is the correct approach for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Correctness of `func_2()`**:
   - The logic for handling 2x2 icons is correct: `math.ceil(y / 2)` ensures that we account for the fact that each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons.
   - The logic for handling 1x1 icons is flawed. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons. Instead, it should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` to subtract the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - After adjusting `x`, the correct number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons should be `math.ceil(x / 15)`, not `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

4. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The correct logic for `func_2()` should be:
     ```python
     def func_2():
         (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
         if x > 0 and y > 0:
             bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
             x = x - bxsfory * 4  # Corrected formula
             bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15) if x > 0 else 0
             print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
         elif x == 0 and y > 0:
             print(math.ceil(y / 2))
         elif x > 0 and y == 0:
             print(math.ceil(x / 15))
         else:
             print(0)
     ```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed formula in `func_2()` for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons and the incorrect calculation of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Correctness: **False**
