Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]` plus the value of `q` at the index `eta[j]`, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**
