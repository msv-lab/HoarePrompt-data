The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, `j` being 2 is still less than `n + 1`, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list. If `q[j]` > 0, `eta` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `eta` contains the integer 0.**
