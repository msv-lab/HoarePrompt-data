The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
