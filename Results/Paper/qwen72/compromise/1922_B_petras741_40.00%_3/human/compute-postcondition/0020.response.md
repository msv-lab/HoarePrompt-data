To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `buffer` is an empty list
- `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3
- `w` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1
- `j` is 0
- `eta` is a list. If `q[j]` > 0, `eta` contains the integer 0

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(n + 1):
```

This loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), meaning `j` will take values from 0 to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, `j` being 1 is still less than `n + 1`, and the loop will execute again.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list. If `q[j]` > 0, `eta` contains the integer 0.**
