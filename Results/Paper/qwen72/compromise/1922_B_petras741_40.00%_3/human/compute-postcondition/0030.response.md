Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `buffer` is an empty list.
4. `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3.
5. `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.
6. `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
7. For each index `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the value at `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
8. `j` is `n`.
9. `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0.
10. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and it is given that `eta_ln` is 1.
11. `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is an input integer and is given to be greater than or equal to 3.
2. **`w`**: This is a list of integers derived from the input. The exact values of `w` are not provided, but we know that for each index `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
3. **`q`**: This is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`. After the increments, `q` will have some non-zero values at the indices specified by `w`.
4. **`eta`**: This is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0. It is given that `eta_ln` (the length of `eta`) is 1, meaning there is exactly one index in `q` where the value is greater than 0.
5. **`rho`**: This is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Since `eta` contains exactly one index, `rho` will be the value at that single index in `q`.

### Calculation:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

This formula calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{3} \). The formula for this is:
\[ \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \]

Since `n` is an integer and the division is integer division (`//`), the result will be the largest integer less than or equal to the exact value of the binomial coefficient.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items.
Output: **\(\binom{n}{3}\) (where \(\binom{n}{3}\) is the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, calculated as \( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \))**
