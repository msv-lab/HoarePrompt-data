### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` which represent the height of the board, width of the board, Alice's initial position, and Bob's initial position respectively.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The function checks if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If `a > c`, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet if Alice starts below Bob.
   - This check is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Move Calculation:**
   - If `a <= c`, the function calculates the number of moves `x` required for Alice and Bob to potentially meet. This is done using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The function then checks if the number of moves is odd or even to determine the player who will make the final move.
   - This calculation and check are correct.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), Alice will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's initial column `b` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `b` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If so, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - This logic is incorrect. The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is not the right way to determine if Alice can win. Instead, Alice can win if her column `b` is within the range `l` to `r` and she can move to Bob's column `d` within the allowed moves.

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is even, Bob will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's initial column `d` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `d` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x`. If so, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - This logic is also incorrect. The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is not the right way to determine if Bob can win. Instead, Bob can win if his column `d` is within the range `l` to `r` and he can move to Alice's column `b` within the allowed moves.

### Corrected Logic:
- For an odd number of moves, Alice wins if her column `b` is within the range `l` to `r` and she can move to Bob's column `d` within the allowed moves.
- For an even number of moves, Bob wins if his column `d` is within the range `l` to `r` and he can move to Alice's column `b` within the allowed moves.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                if l <= b <= r:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                if l <= d <= r:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Alice or Bob can win. The corrected code accurately implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description.
