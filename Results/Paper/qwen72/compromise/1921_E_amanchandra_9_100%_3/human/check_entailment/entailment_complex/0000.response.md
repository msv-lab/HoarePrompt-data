### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func` is defined without any parameters, which is not ideal for clarity. However, it reads the necessary inputs within the function, so this does not affect the correctness of the logic.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the board dimensions `r` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The first condition checks if Alice's chip is already in a position where it is impossible for her to win, i.e., if `a > c`. If this is true, the function prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move her chip to a row above `c` (Bob's row).

3. **Calculating the Distance:**
   - The function calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips in terms of rows: `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - This calculation is based on the idea that Alice and Bob will move towards each other, and the number of moves they can make is determined by the difference in their row positions.

4. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(a - c)` is odd, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Alice can move to within `x + 1` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice can move to a column that overlaps with Bob's chip: `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - If this condition is true, Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

5. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(a - c)` is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Bob can move to within `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob can move to a column that overlaps with Alice's chip: `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - If this condition is true, Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for determining the winner or a draw is based on the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the number of moves they can make.
- The function correctly handles the cases where Alice or Bob cannot move beyond the board boundaries.
- The conditions for determining the winner are logically sound and match the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description and input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
