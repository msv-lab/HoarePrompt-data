The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, but it will take on the values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it is reasonable to assume that `int(input())` is `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and equal to `t`**
