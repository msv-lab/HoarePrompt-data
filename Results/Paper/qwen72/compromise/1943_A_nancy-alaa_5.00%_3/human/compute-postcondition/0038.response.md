Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False, `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking, the loop will execute again if the integer input provided by `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- The Counter object `mpp` is updated to contain the frequency of each integer in the new `arr`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `first`, and `i` are not directly modified by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
- The loop condition and the state of `first` and `i` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not affect these variables directly.
