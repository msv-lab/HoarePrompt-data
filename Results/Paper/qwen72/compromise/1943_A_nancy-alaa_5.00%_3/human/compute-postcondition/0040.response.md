Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking, the loop will execute again if the integer input provided by `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count.**

The code snippet `first = False` sets the variable `first` to `False`, overriding its previous value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
