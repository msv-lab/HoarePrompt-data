Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is True.
   - `i` is a key in the `mpp` Counter object, and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.
   - The `Counter` object `mpp` contains the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`.
   - The frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, meaning `i` appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the integer `i` which is a unique element in the list `arr` (i.e., it appears exactly once in `arr`).

Output: **i (where i is a unique integer in the list `arr` that appears exactly once)**
