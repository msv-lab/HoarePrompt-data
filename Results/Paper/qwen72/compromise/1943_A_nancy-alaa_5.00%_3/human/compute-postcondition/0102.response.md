Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and conditions step by step:

1. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. **`n`**: The value of `n` is greater than 2. This information is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement, but it ensures that the loop or condition involving `i` can proceed.
3. **`first`**: The value of `first` is determined by the condition `if mpp[i] is 1`. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to `True`; otherwise, it remains `False`.
4. **`mpp`**: `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. The list `arr` is input by the user, so the exact contents of `arr` and thus `mpp` are not known. However, we know that `i` (which is 2) must be a key in `mpp` for the program to continue executing the next statement after the if block.
5. **`arr`**: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. The exact values in `arr` are not provided, but we know that `2` is one of the integers in `arr` because `i` (which is 2) is a key in `mpp`.

Given these conditions, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
