Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `arr` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
