The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition `n > i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

The other variables (`first` and `mpp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `first` is True, and `mpp` remains unchanged.**
