You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if any integer from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False, and `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then finds and prints the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, provided that a previous integer in the range has already appeared exactly once in `arr`. If no such integer is found, it prints the last integer checked. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range `[1, 20000]`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is a boolean indicating whether any integer from `0` to `n-1` appeared exactly once in `arr` before the loop broke.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains all elements from `0` to `n-1` exactly once. In such a case, the MEX of the final array `c` should be `n` because all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `c`. However, the program will incorrectly output `n-1` because it breaks the loop as soon as it finds an element that is not in `mpp` or an element that appears only once and `first` is `True`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

Actual output:
```
4
```
