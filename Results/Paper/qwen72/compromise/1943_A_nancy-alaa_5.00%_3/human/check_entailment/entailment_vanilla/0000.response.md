Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are not included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - Both players will focus on the smallest integers first, as they are the most critical for determining the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range of possible values (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The first condition checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` keys. If it is not, it means `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The second condition checks if `i` appears exactly once in the array and if it is Alice's turn (`first` is `True`). If both conditions are met, it means Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The third condition sets `first` to `True` when `i` appears exactly once, indicating that Alice will pick this element on her next turn.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the smallest integer that is not in the array.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Alice and Bob are playing optimally by ensuring that Alice picks the smallest integer that appears exactly once when it is her turn.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a specific order that affects the MEX.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by following the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
