The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then finds and prints the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, provided that a previous integer in the range has already appeared exactly once in `arr`. If no such integer is found, it prints the last integer checked. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range `[1, 20000]`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is a boolean indicating whether any integer from `0` to `n-1` appeared exactly once in `arr` before the loop broke.
