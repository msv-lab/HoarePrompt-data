Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 1. If the second element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 1. If the third element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 3. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains 0.***
