Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and those cubes are removed, but the favorite cube itself is not removed. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

The favorite cube is the second cube with a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The first two cubes removed are `[4, 3]`, and the favorite cube is not among them. However, the program will output "MAYBE" because it counts the number of cubes with the favorite value that are removed, but it does not check if the favorite cube itself is among the removed cubes. This is a case where the program does not work as expected.
