You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0` (since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final depth must return to 0); for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at position `i` in the string `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` at positions specified in `d`, in the order of their corresponding depths.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains characters from `s` at positions specified in `d`, in the order of their corresponding depths.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - We need to compute the balanced shuffle of this sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle is defined by sorting the characters based on the prefix balance and position as described.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` and calls the function `func_1` with this string.
   - Inside `func_1`, the length of the string `s` is stored in `n`.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to store the result.
   - A dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - The initial balance is set to 0 (`d[0] = 0`).

3. **Computing the Prefix Balance:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and updates the prefix balance in the dictionary `d`.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The balance is stored at the position `i + 1` in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Removing the Last Element:**
   - The last element of the dictionary `d` is removed using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the last position is not needed for sorting the prefixes.

5. **Sorting the Dictionary:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance (`x[1]`).
   - If two positions have the same balance, the position is sorted in decreasing order (`key=lambda x: x[1]`).

6. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted dictionary and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified in the sorted dictionary.

7. **Output:**
   - The result string `ans` is returned and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Dictionary Key Initialization:**
  - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, but the loop starts from `i = 0` and updates `d[i + 1]`. This means the dictionary will have keys from 1 to `n-1`, but the last key `n` will be missing.
  - Removing `d.pop(n)` is correct because the last key is not needed, but the initial key `0` should not be used in the loop.

- **Sorting Ties:**
  - The sorting step `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` does not handle ties in decreasing order of position. It should be `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))` to ensure that positions with the same balance are sorted in decreasing order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = input().strip()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        d[i] = balance
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described.
- **False** if the program is not corrected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to handle the sorting of positions with the same balance in decreasing order and to ensure the dictionary keys are correctly used.
