### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance (depth) of the parentheses at each position.
   - The initial balance `d[0]` is set to 0, which is correct as the balance before the first character is 0.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This correctly calculates the balance at each position.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (which is `d[n]` and should be 0 because `s` is a balanced sequence).
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in ascending order, and in case of ties, by the positions in descending order.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` at the positions specified in the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - This step ensures that the characters are appended in the order of their corresponding depths, which is the core of the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Output:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the balance at each position.
- The sorting of the dictionary ensures that characters are appended in the correct order based on their depth.
- The final result string `ans` is constructed by appending characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary.

### Example:
- For the input `s = "(()(()))"`, the balance at each position is:
  - `d = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}`
- After removing the last entry and sorting:
  - `d = [(1, 1), (8, 0), (4, 1), (2, 1), (7, 1), (5, 2), (3, 1), (6, 2)]`
- The result string `ans` is constructed as:
  - `ans = "()" + "(" + "(" + ")" + "(" + ")" + ")" + ")" = "()(()())"`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
