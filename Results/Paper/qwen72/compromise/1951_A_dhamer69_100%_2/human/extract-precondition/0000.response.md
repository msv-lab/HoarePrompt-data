It seems there is a misunderstanding in the provided function definition. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition given is `def func():`. Let's correct the function definition to match the problem description and then extract the precondition.

Corrected function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
