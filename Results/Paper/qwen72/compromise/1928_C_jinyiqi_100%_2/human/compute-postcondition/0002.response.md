The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1, which means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1. Given that `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, the minimum value of `x` that satisfies this condition is 1. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1**
