The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that \(1 \le x \le 10^9\). The function returns a list containing all divisors of `x` in descending order. Specifically, the list combines divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` with divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but the latter are included in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x` in descending order.**
