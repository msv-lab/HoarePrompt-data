The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which defines the upper limit of the loop. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `x` must still be such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 2.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output1` remains an empty list. `output2` is a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list. `i` is 2, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 2.**
