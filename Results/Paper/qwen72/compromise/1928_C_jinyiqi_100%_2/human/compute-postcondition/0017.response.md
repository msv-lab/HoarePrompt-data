Output State: **The program returns a list that combines all the divisors of `x` greater than or equal to the square root of `x` (from `output2`) with all the divisors of `x` less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order (from `output1`). The resulting list contains all divisors of `x` in descending order.**
