The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The loop will execute again if `3` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output1` remains `[1]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 2]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output2` remains `[x]`. `i` is 3, `int(x ** 0.5)` must be greater than or equal to 3**
