Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output1` remains `[1]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 2]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output2` remains `[x]`. `i` is 2.***
