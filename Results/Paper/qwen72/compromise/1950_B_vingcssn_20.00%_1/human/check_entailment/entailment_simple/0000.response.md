Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard pattern based on the given integer `n`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Limited Range Handling**: The program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) and prints a predefined pattern for each. This approach is not scalable and does not handle the general case for any `n` within the range 1 to 20. For values of `n` outside 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango", which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

2. **Pattern Generation**: The patterns for `n` = 1, 2, 3, 4 are hardcoded, which means the program will not generate the correct pattern for other values of `n`. The problem requires a dynamic solution that can generate the checkerboard for any valid `n`.

3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case, but it fails to handle the general case for `n`.

4. **Output Format**: The program should output the checkerboard pattern for each test case without any additional messages like "No esta en el rango".

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
