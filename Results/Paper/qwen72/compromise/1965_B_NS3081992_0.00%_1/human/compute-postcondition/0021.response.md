Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n still holds true, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..., 2^(l-1)]. Otherwise, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, and `ans` now contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).***
