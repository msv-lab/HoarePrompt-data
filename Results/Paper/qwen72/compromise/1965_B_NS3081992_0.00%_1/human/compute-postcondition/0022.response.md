Output State: **The program returns a string containing the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. Otherwise, `ans` is a list that starts with the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
