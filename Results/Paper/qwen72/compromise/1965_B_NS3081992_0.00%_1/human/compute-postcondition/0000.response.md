The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the return value of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to `func_15()`, and the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (used when the variable is not needed), the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
