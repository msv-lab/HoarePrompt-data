You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It prints the value returned by `func_14` a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10`, each value on a new line. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_14` is the main function responsible for generating the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
   - `func_15` is the function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Function 14 Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which splits the input into integers.
   - **Base Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case where `n == 2` by returning the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - For other values of `n`, it constructs the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed by summing the powers of 2.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - It constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to `k-1`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence includes all necessary powers of 2 to form any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` and `n == 2` correctly.
   - The function also handles the general case for `k > 1` and ensures the sequence meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

Correctness: **True**
