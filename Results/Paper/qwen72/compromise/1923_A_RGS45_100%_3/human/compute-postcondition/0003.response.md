The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and the second element is a list of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1, representing the state of the ribbon. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).

The function returns the result of processing each test case. The exact output for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function will return some value based on the state of the ribbon (the list of integers).
