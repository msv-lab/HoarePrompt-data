Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of a ribbon. The function prints the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 in each test case. The function does not return any value, and the variables used within the function do not persist between test cases. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the results for each one, and the variables will hold the values from the last test case. **
