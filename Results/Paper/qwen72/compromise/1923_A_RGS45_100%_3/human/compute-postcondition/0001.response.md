The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of the list of test cases and the contents of each test case (n and the list of integers) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
