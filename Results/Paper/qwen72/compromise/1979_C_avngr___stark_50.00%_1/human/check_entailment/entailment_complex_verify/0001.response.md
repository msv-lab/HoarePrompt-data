### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of Product `m`**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k[i]` and stores it in `m`. This is intended to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program right before the function call confirms that `n` is within the valid range and `k` contains valid multipliers. The product `m` is correctly calculated as the product of all elements in `k`.

3. **Distributing Coins**:
   - The program then calculates the bets `c[i]` for each outcome as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that the total bet for each outcome, when multiplied by its respective multiplier, will be `m`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program confirms that `c` is a list of integers where each element is `m / k[i]`. This is correct and ensures that the bets are integers.

4. **Finding the HCF (Highest Common Factor)**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to find the HCF of the bets `c`. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the HCF of the list `c`. The state of the program confirms that `hcf` is the GCD of all elements in `c`, and the list `c` remains unchanged.

5. **Checking the Sum of Bets**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program confirms that the sum of the reduced bets `c` is compared with `m / hcf`. This is the correct condition to ensure that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the bets for each test case, or `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program confirms that the bets are printed in the correct format, and `-1` is printed if the sum of the bets is not less than `m / hcf`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The program's approach of calculating the product `m` and then distributing the bets as `m / k[i]` is mathematically sound. It ensures that the bets are integers and that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
  - Reducing the bets by their HCF is a valid method to find the smallest possible bets that satisfy the condition.

- **Efficiency**:
  - While the product `m` can lead to very large numbers, especially for large `n`, this is not a correctness issue but rather an efficiency concern. The problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) ensure that the product `m` will not exceed the limits of typical integer types in Python.
  - The use of the HCF to reduce the bets is efficient and ensures that the bets are the smallest possible while maintaining the required ratios.

### Potential Issues:

- **Large Numbers**:
  - The product `m` can indeed be very large, but this is not a correctness issue given the constraints. Python's integer type can handle very large numbers, so the program will not fail due to overflow.

- **HCF Calculation**:
  - The HCF calculation is correct and necessary to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values.

- **Sum Check**:
  - The sum check `sum(c) < m / hcf` is the correct condition to ensure that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required results. The potential issue of large numbers is not a correctness concern given the problem constraints.

### Correctness:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it follows. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required results.
