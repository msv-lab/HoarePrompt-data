Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the multipliers are all the same. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3
3 3 3
```

For this input, the program will calculate `m` as `3 * 3 * 3 = 27`. The list `c` will be `[9, 9, 9]` after the division by `k[i]`. The HCF (highest common factor) of `c` will be `9`. The sum of `c` is `9 + 9 + 9 = 27`, and `m / hcf` is also `27 / 9 = 3`. The program will then check if `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, which evaluates to `27 >= 3`, and it will print `-1`.

However, a valid solution exists for this case. For example, you can bet `1` coin on each outcome, and the total bet is `3` coins. If any outcome wins, you will receive back `3 * 1 = 3` coins, which is exactly equal to the total bet. Since the problem requires the total amount of coins received back to be strictly greater than the total bet, this is not a valid solution, but the program incorrectly concludes that no solution exists.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
