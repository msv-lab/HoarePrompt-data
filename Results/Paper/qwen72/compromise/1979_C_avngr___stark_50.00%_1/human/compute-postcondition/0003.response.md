The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element (i.e., `numbers[1:]`).

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in the list `numbers` after the second element, which is the third element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `num` should now be the third element in the list `numbers`.
- The list `numbers` must still have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `k` and the second element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`**.
