Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is 1 if `nums[2] > k`, otherwise `idx` remains -1, `i` is 2, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values. If `nums[2] > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
