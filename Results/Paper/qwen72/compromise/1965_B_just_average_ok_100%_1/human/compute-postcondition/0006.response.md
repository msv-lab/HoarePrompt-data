Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -2, `i` is 0, and the value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1 - 1, which is -2. The other variables remain unchanged.
