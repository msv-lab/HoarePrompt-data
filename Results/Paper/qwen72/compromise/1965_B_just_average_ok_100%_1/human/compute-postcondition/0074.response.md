The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem statement, so we can only infer that the function returns some value or set of values based on the input parameters `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each case. The exact nature of the result depends on the values of `n` and `k`, but the function is designed to handle up to 1000 test cases where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.**
