The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables mentioned (t, n, k) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, the input value must be greater than 0**
