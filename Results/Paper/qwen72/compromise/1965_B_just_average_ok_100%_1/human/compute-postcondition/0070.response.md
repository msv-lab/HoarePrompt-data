Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the value \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\); `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`; `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists; the length of `nums` is 23; the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**
