To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the function call `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0. This means `nums` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 (i.e., \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - `idx` is -1 (not directly relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must be a non-empty list. Given that `nums` is already defined as a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), it is guaranteed to be non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) (which ensures it is non-empty).
- `i` is 0 (the initial value for the loop index).

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0**
