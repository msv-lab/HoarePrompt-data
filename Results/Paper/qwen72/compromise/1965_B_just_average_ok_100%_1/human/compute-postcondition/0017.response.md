Output State: **If `nums[i]` (where `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` greater than `k`) is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to `i - 1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 after the loop completes all iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop iterates through the `nums` list, which contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- For each element in `nums`, it checks if the element is greater than `k`.
- If an element is found that is greater than `k`, the variable `idx` is set to the index of the previous element (i.e., `i - 1`), and the loop breaks.
- If no such element is found (i.e., all elements in `nums` are less than or equal to `k`), `idx` remains -1 after the loop completes all iterations.
