Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` remains -1, `i` is 20, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` generates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` is now `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`.
- The initial state mentions that `idx` remains -1 if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. Since the code does not change `idx`, it remains -1.
- The initial state also mentions that `i` is 20. Since the code does not change `i`, it remains 20.
- The length of `nums` is now 21 because the list comprehension generates 21 elements.
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, as specified in the initial state.
- The conditions about the last element in `nums` and the removal of `1 << idx` from `nums` are not affected by the code snippet provided, so they remain as stated in the initial state.
