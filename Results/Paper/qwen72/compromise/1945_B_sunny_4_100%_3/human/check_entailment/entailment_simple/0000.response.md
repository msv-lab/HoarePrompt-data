Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
2. It calculates the number of times the first installation can launch a firework within the visibility window of `m` minutes, which is `m // a`.
3. It calculates the number of times the second installation can launch a firework within the visibility window of `m` minutes, which is `m // b`.
4. It adds 2 to the sum of the above two calculations and prints the result.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility times of the fireworks. Specifically, the addition of 2 assumes that the first firework from each installation will always overlap, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the first time both installations launch a firework simultaneously and then calculate the number of such overlaps within the visibility window.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of times both installations launch a firework simultaneously within the visibility window.
3. Calculate the total number of fireworks visible by considering the individual launches and the overlaps.

Given the current logic, the program does not correctly handle the overlapping visibility times, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
