### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - To find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
   - However, this simple calculation does not account for the possibility of multiple fireworks being visible at the same time due to overlapping visibility periods.

4. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct approach is to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches.
   - If `lcm(a, b)` is the LCM of `a` and `b`, then the number of simultaneous fireworks launched at any time is determined by the number of times `lcm(a, b)` fits into `m + 1`.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The given program calculates the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes for both installations and adds 2 to the result.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the LCM of `a` and `b` and the overlap of visibility periods.

6. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct solution should involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining the number of simultaneous fireworks based on the visibility period.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility periods of the fireworks. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes for both installations and adds 2, which is not a valid approach to solve the problem. The correct solution should involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and considering the overlap of visibility periods.
