The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from the input, and for each test case, it calculates the value `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints this result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
