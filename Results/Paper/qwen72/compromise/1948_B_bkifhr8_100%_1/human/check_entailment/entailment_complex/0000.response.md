### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Non-decreasing Check:**
   - The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it means the array is not currently sorted in non-decreasing order at this position.

3. **Digit Replacement and Sorting Check:**
   - When `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, the function replaces `arr[i-1]` with its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the array cannot be made non-decreasing with the given operation.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True`, indicating that the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Digit Replacement:**
   - The current implementation replaces `arr[i-1]` with the first digit of the list of digits (`nums[0]`), but it should replace `arr[i-1]` with the entire list of digits.
   - The correct approach is to replace `arr[i-1]` with the list of digits and then flatten the array to ensure it remains a list of integers.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function should check if the entire array can be made non-decreasing after the replacement, not just the list of digits.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                # Replace arr[i-1] with its digits and append arr[i] to the list
                nums = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                # Flatten the array to ensure it remains a list of integers
                arr = arr[:i-1] + nums + arr[i+1:]
                # Check if the entire array is now sorted
                if arr != sorted(arr):
                    ans = False
                    break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Flattening the Array:**
  - When `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, the function replaces `arr[i-1]` with its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - The array is then flattened to ensure it remains a list of integers.
  - This is done by slicing the array before and after the position `i-1` and concatenating the list of digits in between.

- **Sorting Check:**
  - After the replacement, the function checks if the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If the array is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

### Final Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the digit replacement and sorting check, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.
