Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the required algorithm. The issue lies in the way the program attempts to check and modify the array to ensure it can be sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array when it finds an element that is smaller than the previous element, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of breaking down elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and reinserting them.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digit Splitting**:
   - The program attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and then checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, this is not the correct way to handle the operation. The operation should split the element and insert the digits in the same position, not just check if the digits are sorted.
   - The program also incorrectly appends the current element `arr[i]` to the list of digits, which is not part of the operation described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program only checks the immediate next element when it finds a violation of the sorted order. This is insufficient because the operation can affect multiple elements in the array, and the program should consider the entire array after performing the operation.

3. **Missing Simulation of the Operation**:
   - The program does not simulate the operation of splitting elements and reinserting the digits. Instead, it only modifies the array in a way that does not reflect the actual operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the operation of splitting elements and reinserting the digits, and then check if the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    def simulate_operations(arr):
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                new_arr.extend(split_number(num))
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        return new_arr
    
    def is_sorted(arr):
        return all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))
    
    new_arr = simulate_operations(arr)
    return is_sorted(new_arr)

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version:
1. Defines a function `split_number` to split a number into its digits.
2. Defines a function `simulate_operations` to simulate the operation of splitting elements and reinserting the digits.
3. Defines a function `is_sorted` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. Uses these functions to determine if the array can be sorted after simulating the operations.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the operation and checks the sorted order of the resulting array.
