Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `ans1` is now the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
