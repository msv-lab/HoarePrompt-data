Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
