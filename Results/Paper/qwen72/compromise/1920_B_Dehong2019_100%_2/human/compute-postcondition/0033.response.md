Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from `a[x]` to `a[x + k - 1]` (if `x + k - 1` is less than `n`), and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop iterations.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are specific integers provided by the input, and these values are used in the subsequent calculations.
