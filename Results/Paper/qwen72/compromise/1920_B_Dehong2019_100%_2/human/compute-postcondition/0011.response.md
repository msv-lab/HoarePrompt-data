Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value.
- Since `i` is 2, `ans1` is now the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
