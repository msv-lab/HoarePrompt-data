Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from `a[x]` to `a[x + k - 1]` (if `x + k - 1` is less than `n`), and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop iterations.**

The code snippet `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)` updates the variable `a` to be a sorted list of integers in descending order, based on the input provided. The initial state of `a` being a sorted list of integers in descending order is now explicitly defined by the new input. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The expressions for `ans1` and `ans2` are still valid and depend on the new sorted list `a`.
