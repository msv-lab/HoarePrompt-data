Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.**

The code snippet `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `ans1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
