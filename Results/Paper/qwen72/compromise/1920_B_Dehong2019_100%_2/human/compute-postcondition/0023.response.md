Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[x]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[x + x]`. `ans2` retains its value as described in the precondition.***
