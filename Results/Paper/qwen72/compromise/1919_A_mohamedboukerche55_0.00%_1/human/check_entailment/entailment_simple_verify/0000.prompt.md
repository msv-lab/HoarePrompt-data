You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it only checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd to determine the winner. However, this approach is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the specific values of `a` and `b` and the sequence of moves, not just their sum.

For example, consider the test case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`:
- According to the problem description, Alice can win this game by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, leaving Bob with 1 coin and Alice with 3 coins. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, leaving him with 0 coins, and Alice will win.
- However, the provided program will output "bob" because `(1 + 4) % 2 == 1`, which is incorrect.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle the game logic correctly and thus is incorrect.
