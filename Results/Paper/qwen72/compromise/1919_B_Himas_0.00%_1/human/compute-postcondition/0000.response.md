The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, as this will determine the number of iterations. The variable `i` will start from 0, as is typical for a `range` loop in Python.

State: **`s` is a string of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
