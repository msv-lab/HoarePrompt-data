The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given context. However, based on the parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes the string `s` in some way for each test case `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It processes the string `s` for each test case and returns a result based on the processing.**
