Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `s` remains unchanged as a string of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The variable `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. The loop has printed the result of `P - M` for each test case, where `P` is the count of '+' characters and `M` is the count of '-' characters in the string `e` for each test case.**
