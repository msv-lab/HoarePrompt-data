### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. However, the program simply sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` without ensuring that this is the correct MEX. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already optimal (i.e., the sum cannot be increased by any operation). For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program should return the sum as `6` and `0` operations, but it might incorrectly attempt to perform operations.

4. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. It does not correctly split the array and handle the MEX calculation for each segment. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid way to determine whether to perform an operation. The program should correctly compute the MEX and apply it to the subarray.

### Specific Example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10 0
```

**Actual Output:**
- The program will likely attempt to perform operations and change the array, which is incorrect because the sum of the array is already maximized.

### Correct MEX Calculation:
To correctly compute the MEX, the program should:
- Identify the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.
- This can be done by creating a set of the subarray and iterating through non-negative integers to find the smallest one not in the set.

### Correct Recursive Logic:
The recursive logic should:
- Correctly compute the MEX for the subarray.
- Apply the MEX to the subarray if it increases the sum.
- Recursively handle the left and right segments of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases. The issues include incorrect function calls, incorrect MEX calculation, and flawed recursive logic.

### Final:
Final: **False**
