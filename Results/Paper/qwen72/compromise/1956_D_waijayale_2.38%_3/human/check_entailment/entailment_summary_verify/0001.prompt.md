You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from standard input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of all elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum element in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` retain their initial values, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the computation performed by `func_2`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation where we choose a subarray `a[l:r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX will be the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where `l == r` and also to recursively set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If false, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively calls itself for the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly splits the array based on the maximum value and recursively maximizes the sum for the subarrays.
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the output in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle arrays of length 1 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [0]` and the output is `1 1 1 1`.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is 0 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [0, 1]` and the output is `4 1 1 2`.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is greater than 0 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [1, 3, 9]` and the output is `13 0`.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program uses recursion and splits the array based on the maximum value, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the base cases, recursive splits, and edge cases appropriately, and it ensures that the number of operations is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
