The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a`, two integers `l` and `r` such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and a list `ops` to store tuples of integers representing operations. It modifies the list `a` and appends tuples to `ops` based on certain conditions. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function does not return any value, returning `None` instead. After the function concludes, the list `a` may have some of its elements modified, and the list `ops` may contain tuples representing the operations performed. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
