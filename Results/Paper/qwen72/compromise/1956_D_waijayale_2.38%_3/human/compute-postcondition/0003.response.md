To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `m` based on the initial state and the function `func_2(a)`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

### Function `func_2(a)`:
Since the function `func_2(a)` is not provided, we can only infer the values of `s` and `m` based on typical operations that might be performed on a list of integers. Common operations include summing the elements, finding the maximum or minimum, or other aggregate functions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers with each element \(a_i\) in the range \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - The length of `a` is `n`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - Without the exact implementation, we can assume that `s` and `m` are likely to be the sum and the maximum (or minimum) of the elements in the list `a`, respectively.
   - `ops` might be some other value or operation result, but it is not printed in the given statement.

3. **Values of `s` and `m`**:
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `m` is the maximum element in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(s, m)` statement will print the sum of all elements in the list `a` and the maximum element in the list `a`.

### Output:
Output: **s, m (where s is the sum of all elements in the list a and m is the maximum element in the list a)**
