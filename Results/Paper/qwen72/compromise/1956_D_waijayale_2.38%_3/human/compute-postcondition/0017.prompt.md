You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array a. a is a list of integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. ops is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r).
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: The elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` are all set to the value `r - l + 1`. The variables `l`, `r`, `n`, `ops`, and `s` remain unchanged.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive call is made.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), and `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. If `s` <= `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` are all set to the value `r - l + 1`, and `l`, `r`, `n`, `ops`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `s` > `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive call is made.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the maximum possible sum that can be obtained by selecting elements from the subarray `a[l:r+1]` in a way that alternates between adding and subtracting the selected elements, starting with addition.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
