Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, and the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain the same.
- The list `a` and the list `ops` remain unchanged.
- The sum `s` of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` remains greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
- The maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` remains the same.
- The index `pos` of `mx` in the original list `a` remains the same.
- The condition that the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l` remains valid.
- The function call itself is part of the output state, indicating that the function has been invoked with the specified arguments.
