The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `b`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `b`. Since `b` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). If \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is updated to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**
