Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the state of the program includes the number of test cases `T`, the current test case index `t`, the input values `a` and `b`, and the calculated sum `suma`. The function effectively processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each. **
