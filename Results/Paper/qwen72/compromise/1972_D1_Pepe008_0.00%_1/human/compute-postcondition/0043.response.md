The provided code snippet assigns new values to `a` and `b` based on the first two elements of the list `info`. Since `a` and `b` were already defined in the initial state as the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]`, respectively, the code does not change their values. However, it explicitly reassigns them, which means the values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
