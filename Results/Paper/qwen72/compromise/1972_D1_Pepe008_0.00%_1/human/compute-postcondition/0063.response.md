The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot determine what the function returns. 

Given the lack of specific output details, I can only describe the expected input parameters.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function's return value is not specified.**
