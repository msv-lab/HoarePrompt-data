Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1` which simplifies to `a + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`.
- This further simplifies to `(a - 0) // 1 + 1`, which is `a + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
