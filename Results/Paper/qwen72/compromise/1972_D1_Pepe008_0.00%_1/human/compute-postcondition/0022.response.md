The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `info`. This operation updates the value of `info` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop, where each `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.**
