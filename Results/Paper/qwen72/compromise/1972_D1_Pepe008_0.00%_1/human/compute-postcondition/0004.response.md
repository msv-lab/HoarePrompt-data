The provided Python code snippet contains nested loops that iterate over ranges defined by the variables `a` and `b`. It checks a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `i` and `j`, and prints the values of `i` and `j` if the condition is met. However, this code does not alter the values of any predefined variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`). The only effect of this code is the potential printing of certain pairs of numbers.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`. Pairs of integers (i, j) are printed where 1 <= i <= a, 4 <= j <= b, and (i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0.**
