The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it. Given the initial state:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `suma` is 0
- `x` is \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\), which simplifies to \(a // 1\) or simply \(a\)
- The current value of \(a - i * (i - 1)\) is greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:

- `suma` is updated to `suma + x`, which is `0 + a` or simply `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`, and the current value of \(a - i * (i - 1)\) is greater than 0.**
