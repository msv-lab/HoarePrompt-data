Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, there are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for \(j\)**:
   - The loop for \(j\) starts from 4 instead of 1. This means the program will miss many potential pairs \((a, b)\) where \(b < 4\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**:
   - The formula used to calculate `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). This formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Subtracting 1 from `suma`**:
   - The final result `suma - 1` is printed, which seems arbitrary and not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Commented Out Code**:
   - There is commented-out code that suggests a different approach, but it is not used in the final calculation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
