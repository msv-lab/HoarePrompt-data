Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Loop Structure**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. Inside the loop, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case, which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.

2. **Condition for Buying at Regular Price**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If this condition is true, the function prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price. This is correct because if the promotion price is higher, it is always cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Condition for Even Number of Yogurts**: The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If `A` is even, the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts using the promotion price for pairs of yogurts. This is correct because if `A` is even, all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotion price.

4. **Condition for Odd Number of Yogurts**: If `A` is odd, the function calculates `X = A // 2`, which is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought. It then prints `X` and `X * C + B`. The first print statement `X` is unnecessary and incorrect because it should only print the total cost, not the number of pairs. The second print statement `X * C + B` correctly calculates the total cost by buying `X` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. However, the first print statement should be removed.

5. **Output Format**: The function should print only one line per test case, which is the minimum cost. The current implementation prints an extra line when `A` is odd, which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the unnecessary print statement when `A` is odd.

Correctness: **False**
