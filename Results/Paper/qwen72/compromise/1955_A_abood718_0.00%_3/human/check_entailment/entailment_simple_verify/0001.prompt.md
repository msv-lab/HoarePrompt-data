You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Depending on the conditions, it prints either A * B, A * C / 2, or two lines: X and X * C + B, where X is A // 2. The specific output for each iteration depends on the input values of A, B, and C.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`).
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost for `A` yogurts is `A * B`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program calculates the total cost by buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price. The total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The number of pairs is `X = A // 2`.
   - The total cost is `X * C + B`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case.

However, there is a mistake in the program. Specifically, in the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program prints `X` (the number of pairs) in addition to the total cost. This is incorrect because it should only print the total cost.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it prints an extra value `X` in the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. The corrected program should only print the total cost.
