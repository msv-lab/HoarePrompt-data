### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function takes an array `a` as input.
     - It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
     - It concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - It then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array) is equal to `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by performing the operation.
     - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

   - **Correctness of `func_1`:**
     - The concatenation of the array with itself is a valid approach to check all possible rotations of the array.
     - The loop checks if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array.
     - If a match is found, it means that the array can be sorted by performing the operation, which is correct.
     - However, the function assumes that the array can be sorted by a single rotation. This assumption is correct because any sequence of prefix-suffix swaps can be reduced to a single rotation that results in the sorted array.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
     - It initializes the index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
     - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

   - **Correctness of `func_2`:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

4. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic in both functions.
   - The reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The concatenation and subarray check in `func_1` effectively determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.
   - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. The concatenation and subarray check in `func_1` effectively determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
