### Reasoning:

1. **func_1(a):**
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing array by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself.
   - The function iterates through the concatenated array, checking if any segment of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a segment is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such segment is found after the loop, the function returns 'No'.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

### Analysis:
- **func_1(a):**
  - The logic of checking if any segment of the concatenated array matches the sorted array is correct. This is because if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array must appear as a contiguous segment in the concatenated array.
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted by checking if the original array itself matches the sorted array.

- **func_2():**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - The final output is correctly formatted, printing each result on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly determines whether the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing array by performing the specified operation and handles multiple test cases as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
