Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing sorted array.
   - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This is a common technique used to handle circular shifts or splits.
   - It iterates through the `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by performing the operation.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The logic in both functions is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The use of `concatenated_a` in `func_1` ensures that all possible splits and swaps are considered, and the input processing in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.
