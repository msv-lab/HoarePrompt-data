You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for each element a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The variable `a` remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variables `N`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict` named `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` inclusive, and returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`. The function does not handle multiple test cases or validate the input range as described in the comments.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game's optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves that Bob can make to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. The program only checks the count of each number and returns the first number that either has a count of 0 or has been chosen by Alice and Bob at least twice. This approach does not guarantee that the final MEX of `c` is the optimal score when both players play optimally.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2. `a = [0, 1, 2]`, `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 2. `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 0. `a = [1]`, `c = [2, 0]`.
4. Bob picks 1. `a = []`, `c = [2, 0]`.

The final array `c` is `[2, 0]`, and its MEX is 1. However, the program returns 2, which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be 3, as the smallest non-negative integer not in `[0, 1, 2]` is 3. This shows that the program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.
