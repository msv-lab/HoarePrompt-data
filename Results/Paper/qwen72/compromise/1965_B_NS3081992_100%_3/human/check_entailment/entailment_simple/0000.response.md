### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`, which correctly reads an integer from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14()` to generate the required sequence and prints the result using `sys.stdout.write`.

2. **Function `func_14()`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
   - It then converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations and calculates their lengths.
   - The function handles two main cases:
     - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
       - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `1\n2`.
       - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to \(2^9\)), which ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 (since all elements are greater than 1) and that all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.
     - **Case 2: `k != 1`**
       - It constructs a sequence of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
       - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.
       - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Correctness of the Sequence Construction:**
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.
   - For `k != 1`, the sequence construction ensures that:
     - The sum of any subsequence of the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\) will not equal `k` because the sum of these powers of 2 is less than `k`.
     - The addition of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the sum of the sequence is just less than `k`.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - The remaining powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\) ensure that all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_14()` returns the sequence in the correct format: the length of the sequence followed by the elements of the sequence separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the required sequence for each test case and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
