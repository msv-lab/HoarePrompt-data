Functionality: ** The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. It internally uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7` where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, where `ans` is a list of the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements. If `k` is not 1, the function returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, where `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. **
