Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 3, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, and `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 3)` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is set to `x - 3`. The loop or if statement continues unless the if condition is met and the loop is broken out of.***
