To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, because the loop starts at `x - 1` and decrements `y` until it reaches 1 (but not 0).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements
- `x` is the third element in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing `best_y`
- `y` is 1
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`
- `max_sum` is 0
- `best_y` is 1

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `y` must be set to `x - 1` and `x` must be at least 2 (which it already is, given the constraints on `test_cases`).

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, and `best_y` is 1**
