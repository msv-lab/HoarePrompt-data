Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `best_y` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop execution, and `y` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 1.
- For each value of `y`, it calculates `gcd_val` as the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- It then calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and `best_y` to `y`, and then breaks out of the loop.
- The loop will break as soon as it finds the first `y` that maximizes `current_sum`, which is why `best_y` will be the largest `y` that satisfies this condition.
- After the loop finishes, `y` will be 1, as the loop iterates down to 1.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `x` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
