Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, the variables `max_sum` and `best_y` retain their original values.
