Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `best_y` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`.
- `current_sum` is calculated as `gcd_val + (x - 3)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
