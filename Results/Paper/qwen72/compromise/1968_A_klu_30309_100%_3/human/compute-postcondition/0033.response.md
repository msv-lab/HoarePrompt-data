Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 1)`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `current_sum` is updated to the value of `gcd_val + y`.
- `gcd_val` is 1.
- `y` is `x - 1`.
- Therefore, `current_sum` becomes `1 + (x - 1)`, which simplifies to `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
