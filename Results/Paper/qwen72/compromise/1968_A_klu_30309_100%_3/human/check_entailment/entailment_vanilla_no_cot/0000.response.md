Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program has a logical error in the loop where it tries to find the best `y` for each `x`. Specifically, the `break` statement is used inside the `if` block, which causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds the first `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. This means that the loop does not necessarily find the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` for all `y` in the range `(1, x-1)`.

To fix this, the `break` statement should be removed so that the loop continues to check all possible values of `y` and ensures that the maximum value is found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

This version of the function will correctly find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
