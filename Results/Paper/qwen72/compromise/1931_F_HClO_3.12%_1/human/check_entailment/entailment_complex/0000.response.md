### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot (m == 1):**
   - If there is only one screenshot, the function directly prints 'yes' because a single screenshot can always be valid. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and stores them in `a1, l1` and `a2, l2` respectively.
   - It then creates `l11` and `l22` by removing `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`. This is done to compare the relative order of the participants in the two lists, excluding the authors of the screenshots.

3. **Comparing the First Two Screenshots:**
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the function prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the relative order of participants (excluding the authors) is different, it is impossible for both screenshots to be valid under the same order of participants.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are equal, the function proceeds to find the positions of `a1` and `a2` in the other list. This is done to determine if the two lists can be aligned by inserting `a1` or `a2` at the correct position.

4. **Finding the Insertion Positions:**
   - The function iterates through the lists to find the positions where `a1` and `a2` should be inserted to align the lists.
   - If `a1` and `a2` are found in the wrong positions, it updates `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are found, the function checks if the lists can be aligned by inserting `a1` or `a2` at the correct position.

5. **Handling the Third Screenshot (if m > 2):**
   - If `m` is greater than 2, the function reads the third screenshot and determines the correct order by comparing the positions of `a1` and `a2` in the third list.
   - It then appends the remaining screenshots to the `val` list.

6. **Validating the Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The function iterates through the remaining screenshots in `val` and checks if they match the reconstructed list `l` (after inserting `a1` or `a2` at the correct position).
   - If any screenshot does not match, the function prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, the function prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement. It checks the relative order of participants in the first two screenshots and aligns them if possible. It then validates the remaining screenshots against the aligned order. The function handles edge cases such as a single screenshot and different relative orders correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
