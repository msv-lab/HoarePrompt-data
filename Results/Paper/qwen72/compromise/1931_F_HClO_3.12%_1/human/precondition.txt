t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the k screenshots is a list of n unique integers ranging from 1 to n, representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted the screenshot. The author of each screenshot is the first integer in the corresponding list. All authors of the screenshots are different.
