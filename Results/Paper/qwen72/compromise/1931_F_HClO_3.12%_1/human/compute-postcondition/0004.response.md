Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`, and `k` lines of input, each containing `n` distinct integers. The function checks if the order of participants in the chat can be consistently reconstructed from the given inputs. For each test case, it outputs 'yes' if the conditions are met, and 'no' otherwise. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, or the input lists. **
