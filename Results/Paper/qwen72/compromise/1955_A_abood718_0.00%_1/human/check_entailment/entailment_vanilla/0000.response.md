Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
- We need to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy \( n \) yogurts.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to variables \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - **If \( B * 2 < C \):**
     - This condition checks if the regular price of two yogurts is less than the promotion price.
     - If true, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
     - The program prints \( A * B \), which is the total cost of buying \( A \) yogurts individually.
   - **Else if \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts \( A \) is even.
     - If true, it means all yogurts can be bought in pairs.
     - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying \( A \) yogurts in pairs.
   - **Else:**
     - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts \( A \) is odd.
     - It calculates \( X \) as \( A // 2 \), which is the number of pairs of yogurts.
     - The program prints \( X \) (which is incorrect, as it should not print the number of pairs).
     - It then prints \( X * C + B \), which is the total cost of buying \( X \) pairs of yogurts and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The program prints \( X \) (the number of pairs) in the `else` block, which is not part of the required output.
  - The correct output should only be the total cost, not the number of pairs.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to remove the extra print statement in the `else` block.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1: \( n = 2, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
  - \( B * 2 = 10 \) which is not less than \( C = 9 \).
  - \( A \% 2 = 0 \) (even), so the program should print \( int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9 \).
- **Test Case 2: \( n = 3, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
  - \( B * 2 = 10 \) which is not less than \( C = 9 \).
  - \( A \% 2 = 1 \) (odd), so the program should print \( 1 * 9 + 5 = 14 \).
- **Test Case 3: \( n = 3, a = 5, b = 11 \)**
  - \( B * 2 = 10 \) which is less than \( C = 11 \).
  - The program should print \( 3 * 5 = 15 \).
- **Test Case 4: \( n = 4, a = 5, b = 11 \)**
  - \( B * 2 = 10 \) which is less than \( C = 11 \).
  - The program should print \( 4 * 5 = 20 \).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the `else` block. The corrected program should only print the total cost.

Correctness: **False**
