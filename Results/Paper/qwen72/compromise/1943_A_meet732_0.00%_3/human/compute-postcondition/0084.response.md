Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and for each integer `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged. However, for each integer `i` that appears in the list `a`, the corresponding element in the list `cntl` at index `i` is incremented by 1. This means that `cntl[i]` will now contain the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The initial state of `cntl` (where each element was 0) has been updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`. The variable `n` and the condition for `cntl[0]` remain unchanged.
