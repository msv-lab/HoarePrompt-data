The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`.

Explanation:
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- For each integer `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.

However, the `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`, not the value of `cntl[0]`.

Output: **0**
