The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must still contain at least one more integer to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `a` contained at least one integer, and `i` was the first integer in the list. For the next iteration, `i` will be the second integer in the list, and `a` must contain at least two integers.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.**
