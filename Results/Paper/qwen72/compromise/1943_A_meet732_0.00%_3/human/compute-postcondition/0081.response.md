Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, and `i` still holds the value of the second integer in the list `a`. The value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
