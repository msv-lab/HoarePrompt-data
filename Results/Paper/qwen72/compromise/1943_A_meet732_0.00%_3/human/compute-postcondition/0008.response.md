The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must contain at least three integers, and `i` must be the third integer in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two integers, and `i` is the second integer in the list. For the loop to execute again, the list `a` must have at least three integers, and `i` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least three integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.**
