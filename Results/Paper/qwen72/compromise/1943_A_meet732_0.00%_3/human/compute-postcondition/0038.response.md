Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` in the range from 1 to `n`. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks and `j` is printed. `n` is an input integer.**
