Postcondition: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i`, and `i` is not in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
