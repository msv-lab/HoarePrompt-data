Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value that is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.
- The dictionary `d` initially has a key `i` with a value that is not `None`.
- The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
