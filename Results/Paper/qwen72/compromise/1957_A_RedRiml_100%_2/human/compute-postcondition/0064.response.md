Postcondition: ***`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `d.get(i)` was `None` initially, `d[i]` is now 1. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` is a list containing the first, second, and third elements of `palka`. If `i` was in `pl` initially, `pl` remains a list containing only the first element of `palka`.***
