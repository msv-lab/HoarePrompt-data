Output State: **`pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element of `pl`, if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is the second element of `pl`.
- The value of `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- If `d[j]` is less than 3, `shapes` remains unchanged.
- The list `pl` and the variable `j` retain their initial values and conditions.
