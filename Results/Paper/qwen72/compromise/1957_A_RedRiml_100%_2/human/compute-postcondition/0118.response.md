Postcondition: **`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `shapes` is `d[j] // 3` plus the previous value of `shapes` if `d[j]` is at least 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (which is the length of `palka`), `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `palka`, `j` is the third element in `pl`.**
