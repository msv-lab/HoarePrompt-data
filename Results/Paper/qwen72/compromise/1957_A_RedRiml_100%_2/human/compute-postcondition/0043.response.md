Output State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `palka`.
- The values of `shapes`, `_`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user.
