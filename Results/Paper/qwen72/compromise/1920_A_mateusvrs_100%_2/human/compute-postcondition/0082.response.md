Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, the current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`, and `r` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it.**
