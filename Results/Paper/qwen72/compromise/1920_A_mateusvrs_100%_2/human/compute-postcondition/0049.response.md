Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list with one additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.***
