Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Initially, `tmp` is 0 if the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax` is not met, or 1 if the condition is met. After the code execution, `tmp` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 2. However, since the initial state specifies that `tmp` is 1 if the condition is met, the output state is `tmp` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
