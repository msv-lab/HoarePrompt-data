Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
