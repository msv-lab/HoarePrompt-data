The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `cx` now contains `x`.**
