The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`. The loop iterates over the elements of `cx`, so for the next iteration, the next element in `cx` should be assigned to `i`. The state of `cx` must also be such that it has at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `_` is `n-1`
- `a` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `cx` is a set that must have at least one element
- `i` is the first element in `cx`
- `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

For the next iteration:
- `i` should be the next (second) element in `cx`
- `cx` must have at least one more element (i.e., at least two elements in total) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1 if the second element in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0**
