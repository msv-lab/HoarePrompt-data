Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` is a collection or object that has `x` added to it.***
