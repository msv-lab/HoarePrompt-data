Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2, `cx` now includes `x`.**

The value of `x` has been added to the collection `cx`. The other variables (`n`, `_`, `a`) remain unchanged, and the preconditions for `n`, `a`, and `x` are still valid.
