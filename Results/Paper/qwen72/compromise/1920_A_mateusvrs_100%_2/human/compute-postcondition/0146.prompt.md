Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list with one additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx` for all `a` values not equal to 1 or 2. If `bx` > `ax`, a new element 0 is appended to the list `r`. If `bx` <= `ax`, `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
