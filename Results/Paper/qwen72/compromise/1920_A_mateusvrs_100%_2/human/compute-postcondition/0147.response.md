To determine what will be printed by the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions that affect the list `r`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and not adjusted.
- `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1 across all test cases.
- `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2 across all test cases.
- `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered for `a` == 3 across all test cases.
- If `bx` > `ax` for any test case, `r` is a list with an element `0` appended for that test case.
- If `bx` ≤ `ax` for any test case, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` for that test case.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for `bx` > `ax`**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the list `r` will have an element `0` appended for that test case.
   - This means that for each test case where `bx` > `ax`, the value `0` will be printed.

2. **Condition for `bx` ≤ `ax`**:
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` will have an element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended for that test case.
   - Here, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).
   - The value `ax - bx + 1` represents the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).
   - The value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` represents the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx`.

### Output:
The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. The elements of `r` are determined by the conditions described above.

- For each test case where `bx` > `ax`, the value `0` will be printed.
- For each test case where `bx` ≤ `ax`, the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` will be printed, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be a series of values, each on a new line, corresponding to the elements of the list `r` based on the conditions given.

Output: **0 (if bx > ax for any test case) or ax - bx + 1 - tmp (if bx ≤ ax for any test case, where tmp is the count of elements in cx between bx and ax inclusive)**

Each value will be printed on a new line, and the number of lines will correspond to the number of test cases.
