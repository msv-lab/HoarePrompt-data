You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the range of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case and returns the number of such integers. If the range is invalid (i.e., the maximum value for type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum value for type 2 constraints), it returns 0 for that test case. Otherwise, it returns the count of integers in the range that are not excluded by type 3 constraints. The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must not be equal to any integer `x` (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Type 1 Constraints (`k >= x`)**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.

- **Type 2 Constraints (`k <= x`)**:
  - The program correctly updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints (`k != x`)**:
  - The program correctly adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be equal to are stored.

- **Range Validation**:
  - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list, which is correct because no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
  - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the constraints, and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It also correctly handles edge cases where no valid `k` exists.

### Correctness:
**True**
