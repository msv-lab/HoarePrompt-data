### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must not be equal to any integer `x` (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be equal to are stored.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Type 1 Constraints (`k >= x`)**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.

- **Type 2 Constraints (`k <= x`)**:
  - The program correctly updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints (`k != x`)**:
  - The program correctly adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be equal to are stored.

- **Range Validation**:
  - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list, which is correct because no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
  - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the constraints, and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It also correctly handles edge cases where no valid `k` exists. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
