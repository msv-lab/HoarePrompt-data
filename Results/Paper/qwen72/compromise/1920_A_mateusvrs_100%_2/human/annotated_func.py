#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all `t` iterations, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1 across all test cases, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2 across all test cases, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered for `a` == 3 across all test cases. If `bx` > `ax` for any test case, `r` is a list with an element `0` appended for that test case. If `bx` ≤ `ax` for any test case, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` for that test case.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 0 (if bx > ax for any test case) or ax - bx + 1 - tmp (if bx ≤ ax for any test case, where tmp is the count of elements in cx between bx and ax inclusive)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the range of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case and returns the number of such integers. If the range is invalid (i.e., the maximum value for type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum value for type 2 constraints), it returns 0 for that test case. Otherwise, it returns the count of integers in the range that are not excluded by type 3 constraints. The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.
