### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process the string `s` and determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it removes `i` from the set.
     - If the set `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If the set `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets the `alphabet` set.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
     - It appends "No" to the output list `OUT`.
     - It finds the smallest character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n - len(s2)` using this character.
     - It appends the constructed string to `OUT`.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `True`, it means all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
     - It appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints each element in the output list `OUT`.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset when it becomes empty, but this does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
  - The calculation `r = len(s1) // k` and the return value `s1[r * k:]` do not correctly handle the requirement to check all possible subsequences of length `n`.
  - Specifically, the function does not generate or check all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
