You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed. `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string. The set `alphabet` will be reset to its original state (containing the first k lowercase English alphabets) if the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it; otherwise, `alphabet` will contain the remaining characters that were not removed during the loop's execution.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the value of `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring is a part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. The value of `s2` is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to process the string `s` and determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it removes `i` from the set.
     - If the set `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If the set `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets the `alphabet` set.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
     - It appends "No" to the output list `OUT`.
     - It finds the smallest character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n - len(s2)` using this character.
     - It appends the constructed string to `OUT`.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `True`, it means all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
     - It appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints each element in the output list `OUT`.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset when it becomes empty, but this does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
  - The calculation `r = len(s1) // k` and the return value `s1[r * k:]` do not correctly handle the requirement to check all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
