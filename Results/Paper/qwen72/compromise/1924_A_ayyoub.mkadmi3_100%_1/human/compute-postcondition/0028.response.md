Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `m` is greater than 1. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string. Additionally, if the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the variables remain unchanged.***
