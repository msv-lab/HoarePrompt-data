Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed. `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string. The set `alphabet` will be reset to its original state (containing the first k lowercase English alphabets) if the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it; otherwise, `alphabet` will contain the remaining characters that were not removed during the loop's execution.**

This means:
- `s1` will be a string containing all characters from `s` that were present in `alphabet` as they were encountered.
- `s2` will either be an empty string or will contain the last character of `s` if that character was the only one left in `alphabet`.
- `alphabet` will be reset to its original state if the last character of `s` was the only one left in `alphabet` when the loop ended, otherwise, it will contain the characters that were not removed during the loop's execution.
