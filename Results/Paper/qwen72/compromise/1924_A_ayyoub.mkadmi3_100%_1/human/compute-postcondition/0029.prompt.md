Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character of `s`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is in the set `alphabet`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding the first character of `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`, and `m` is greater than 1. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string. Additionally, if the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `m` is greater than 1. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string. Additionally, if the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
