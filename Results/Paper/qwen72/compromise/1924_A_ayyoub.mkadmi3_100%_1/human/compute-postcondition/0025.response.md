Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, `s2` is a string containing the third character of `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}` generates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The initial state already specifies that `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
