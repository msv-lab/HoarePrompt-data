The code attempts to remove the third character of `s` from the set `alphabet`. We need to consider whether `i` is in `alphabet` and the conditions under which `s1` and `s2` are defined.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` is the third character of `s`.
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string.
   - Additionally, if the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `alphabet.remove(i)` attempts to remove the third character of `s` from the set `alphabet`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, the removal will succeed, and `i` will no longer be in `alphabet`.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the removal will raise a `KeyError` (but since we are simulating, we assume it does not affect the state).

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
   - The values of `s`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.
   - The length of `alphabet` is reduced by 1 if `i` was in `alphabet`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `i` is removed from `alphabet`, and the length of `alphabet` is reduced by 1. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the variables remain unchanged.**
