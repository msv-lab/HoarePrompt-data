Output State: **`s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed, `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string, `alphabet` will be reset to its original state (containing the first k lowercase English alphabets) if the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it; otherwise, `alphabet` will contain the remaining characters that were not removed during the loop's execution, `r` is equal to the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**
