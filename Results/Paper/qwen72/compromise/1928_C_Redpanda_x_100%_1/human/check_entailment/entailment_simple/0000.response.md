### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific pattern.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The main loop iterates over multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of suitable \( k \) values using the function `func_1` and the generator `generate`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find all factors of \( n \) that are even and satisfy \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - It performs prime factorization of \( n \) and stores the factors in a dictionary.
   - It then uses the `generate` function to yield all possible factors of \( n \).

4. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors of \( n \).
   - It correctly handles the base case when \( k \) equals the length of the prime list, yielding 1.
   - For other cases, it recursively generates factors and multiplies them by the current prime raised to different powers.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates two sets of possible \( k \) values: one using \( h = n - x \) and another using \( h = n + x - 2 \).
   - It then combines these sets and prints the length of the combined set.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).
   - It also correctly handles the special case where \( x = 1 \) by only considering the first set of factors.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the factors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) that are even and satisfy the condition \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - The use of sets ensures that duplicate \( k \) values are not counted multiple times.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly identifies and counts the number of suitable \( k \) values for each test case. The prime factorization and factor generation are implemented correctly, and the conditions for \( k \) are checked appropriately.
