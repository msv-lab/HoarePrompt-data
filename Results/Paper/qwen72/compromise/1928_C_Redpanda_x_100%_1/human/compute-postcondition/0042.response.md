Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and the loop has yielded all values of the form `factor * primes[k]^i` for each `factor` in `rest` and for `i` ranging from 0 to `factors[prime]`.**
