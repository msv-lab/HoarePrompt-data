Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]` multiplied by its new value, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `_` is incremented by 1, and `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_`. A value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

In natural language: The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to be `primes[k]` multiplied by its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.
