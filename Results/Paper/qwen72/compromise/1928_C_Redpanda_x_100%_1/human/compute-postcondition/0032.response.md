The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. Given that `prime_to_i` is 1, the value yielded is `factor * 1`, which is simply `factor`.

The variables and their states that remain unchanged are:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `primes` is a list of prime numbers
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the next element of `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is now 1
- `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 0
- The loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 0, the loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`, and the value `factor` has been yielded.**
