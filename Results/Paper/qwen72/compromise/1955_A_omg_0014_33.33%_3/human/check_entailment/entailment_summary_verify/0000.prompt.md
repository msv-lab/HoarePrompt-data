You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `n` from the input, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then calculates `d` as `c / 2` and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results of the calculations for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the value of `n` being the number of test cases processed, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` being those from the last test case. The value of `t` (if it exists in the calling context) remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. It should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then for each test case, it should read `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the program reads `n` and then tries to read `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, which is not what the problem description specifies.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program uses variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in a way that does not match the problem description. The variable `c` should represent the price for two yogurts, but the program uses `c` and `d` in a way that does not make sense for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not correctly determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The correct approach should be to compare the cost of buying yogurts individually with the cost of buying them in pairs and then adjust for any remaining yogurts.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts in pairs
        cost_pairs = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
