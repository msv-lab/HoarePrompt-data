### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to represent the price of one yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotional price. However, this is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the promotional price for two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2` (the price per yogurt when buying two at the promotional price).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is intended to compare the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price.
   - However, the condition is incorrect because it should compare the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price, which should be `a * (b / 2)`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a * b`, which is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `round(a * d)`, which is the rounded cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price. However, this is also incorrect because it should print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts, not `a` yogurts.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using both the regular price and the promotional price.
   - The cost using the regular price is `n * a`.
   - The cost using the promotional price should be calculated by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The formula for the promotional cost should be `((n // 2) * b) + ((n % 2) * a)`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it misinterprets the variables and the logic for calculating the minimum cost. It should use the correct variables and logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.
