### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the variable names are incorrect. According to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the promotional price for two yogurts.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The variable `c` should be `b` (the promotional price for two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2` (the price per yogurt when buying two at the promotional price).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotional price.
   - The correct condition should be `if n * a < (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a:`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a * b`, which is incorrect. It should print `n * a`, the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `round(a * d)`, which is also incorrect. It should print `((n // 2) * b) + ((n % 2) * a)`, the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotional price.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using both the regular price and the promotional price.
   - The cost using the regular price is `n * a`.
   - The cost using the promotional price should be calculated by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The formula for the promotional cost should be `((n // 2) * b) + ((n % 2) * a)`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because it misinterprets the variables and the logic for calculating the minimum cost. It should use the correct variables and logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Final: **False**
