Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `2 * f`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `m` must be greater than 2**

Explanation:
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to new input integers.
- The values of `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a` is updated to `2 * f` based on the new value of `f`.
- The value of `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, but it is calculated based on the unchanged value of `n`.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
