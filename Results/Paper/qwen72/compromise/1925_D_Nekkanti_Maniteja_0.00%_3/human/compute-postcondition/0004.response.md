Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` under modulo 1000000007, `s` is 0.**

The initial state is updated with the variable `s` being assigned the value 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
