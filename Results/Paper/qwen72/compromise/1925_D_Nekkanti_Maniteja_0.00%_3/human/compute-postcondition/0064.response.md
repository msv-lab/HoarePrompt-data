To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop counter. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `m`. However, the loop head `for i in range(k)` implies that `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `k-1`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

2. **Variable `k`**: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`**
