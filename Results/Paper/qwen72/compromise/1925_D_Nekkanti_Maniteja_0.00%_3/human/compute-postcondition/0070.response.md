Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1` modulo `M`, `i` is `k-1`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Natural Language Description:
- `M` remains 1000000007.
- `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain as the input integers provided.
- `k` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- `i` is updated to `k-1` after the loop completes.
- `s` is updated to the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, and the result is taken modulo `M`. This means `s` accumulates the value of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration of the loop, and the final value of `s` is the total sum of these values, reduced by taking the remainder when divided by `M`.
