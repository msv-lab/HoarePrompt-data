Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the necessary variables.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` for modular arithmetic, which is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is correct because the number of pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, and the modular inverse is used to compute the probability of choosing a specific pair.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly accumulates the initial friendship values `a` by summing `f_i` for all pairs of friends.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions and updates the sum `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is intended to account for the expected increase in friendship values over each excursion.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is used to update the sum `s` for each excursion. Here, `c` is the probability of choosing a specific pair, `i` is the current excursion index, `m` is the number of friend pairs, and `a` is the sum of initial friendship values.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to represent the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends, and `c * a` is the expected value of the initial friendship values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final result `s % M` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output for modular arithmetic problems.

However, there is a subtle issue in the formula used to update `s`:
- The term `c * i * c * m` should be simplified to `c * i * m` because `c` is already the probability of choosing a specific pair, and multiplying it by `c` again is incorrect.
- The correct formula should be `s = s + c * i * m + c * a`.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the formula used to update `s`.

Correctness: **False**
