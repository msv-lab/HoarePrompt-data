### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - The input constraints are correctly handled and the program ensures that the values are within the specified ranges.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `10^9 + 7` using the `pow` function. This is correct because the modular inverse of a number `x` modulo `M` is `x^(M-2) % M` when `M` is a prime number, which `10^9 + 7` is.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It then iterates over the `m` pairs, reading `u`, `v`, and `f` and adding `f` to `a`. This is correct as it accumulates the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `s` to 0, which will store the accumulated expected value.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions, updating `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to represent the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen in the i-th excursion. However, this term is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen in the i-th excursion should be `c * a` (since the friendship value of each chosen pair increases by 1, and the probability of choosing any pair is `c`).
   - The term `c * a` correctly represents the expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `s` modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program has a logical error in the expected value calculation. The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect and should be removed. The correct formula for updating `s` should be `s = s + c * a`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program contains a logical error in the expected value calculation, which affects the correctness of the solution. The corrected program, as shown above, should be used instead.
