The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. The variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the single element 1000, `i` is 1**
