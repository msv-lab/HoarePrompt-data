The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. This operation changes the order of elements in `a` but does not affect the values of other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `line` is a string input by the user
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`
- `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])]
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing the code `a = a[::-1]`, the list `a` is reversed. The new order of elements in `a` is the reverse of the original order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (999 - T[0]) - T[1], 999 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`.**
