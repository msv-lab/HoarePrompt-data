The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them with spaces, storing the result in the variable `result`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3
- `n` is the input integer
- `line` is a new string input by the user
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`
- `a` is a list of integers calculated as follows: `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that the variable `result` now holds the string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is the input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
