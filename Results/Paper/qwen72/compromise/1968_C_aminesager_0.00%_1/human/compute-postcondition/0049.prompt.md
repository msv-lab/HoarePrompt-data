Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list of n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), where x_i represents the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (999 - T[0]) - T[1], 999 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is the input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
