The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string `line` into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `T`.

- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `line` is used to create the list `T`, but its value remains unchanged.
- The new variable `T` is created and holds a list of integers derived from the string `line`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.**
