The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def find_subarrays(a, n, k):` where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list `a` contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.
