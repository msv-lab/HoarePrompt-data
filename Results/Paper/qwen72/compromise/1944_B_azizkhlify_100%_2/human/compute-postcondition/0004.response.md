Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` and `k` are the values from the input split, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code snippet `r = [0] * n` creates a new list `r` that contains `n` zeros. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were from the input split. The placeholder `_` and the list `a` of integers from the input split also remain unchanged. The list `l` continues to be a list of `n` zeros. The new list `r` is also a list of `n` zeros.
