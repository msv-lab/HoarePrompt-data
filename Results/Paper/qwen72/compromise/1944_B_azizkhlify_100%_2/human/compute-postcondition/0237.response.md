Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 0.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: The initial state tells us that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. This means that the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 0) is such that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2. Therefore, `a[0]` must be 3 because `l[2]` is 2 (since `a[0] - 1` is 2, `a[0]` must be 3).

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[0]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **3 3**
