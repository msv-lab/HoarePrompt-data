Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[1] - 1` of the list `l` by 1. Since `i` is 1, the specific index being incremented is `a[1] - 1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The initial state mentioned that `l[a[0] - 1]` was incremented by 1, which is still valid and unchanged by this code.
