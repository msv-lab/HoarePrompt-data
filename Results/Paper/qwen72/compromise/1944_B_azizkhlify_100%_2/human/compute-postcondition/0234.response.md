Output State: **`i` is `2n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `2n`, indicating that the loop has completed its range from `n` to `2n-1`. The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, which is `n` in this case. The list `l` will have its elements at indices `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, as specified in the initial state. Additionally, the list `r` will have its elements at indices `a[k] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`, reflecting the changes made by the loop during its execution.
