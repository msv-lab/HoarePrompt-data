The loop head consists of variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, the range `range(n, 2 * n)` must contain at least one element. This means that `2 * n` must be greater than `n`. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

- `i` is initially set to `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head, which will start `i` at `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at `n`**
