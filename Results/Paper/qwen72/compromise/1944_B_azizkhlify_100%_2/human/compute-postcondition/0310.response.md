Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2.***
