The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range `n` to `2 * n` must contain at least one value for the loop to run. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `n` to align with the range specified in the loop head.

State: **`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`**
