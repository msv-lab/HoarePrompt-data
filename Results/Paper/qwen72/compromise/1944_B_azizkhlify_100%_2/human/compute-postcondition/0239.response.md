Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is increased by 2.**

The value of `ul` is incremented by 2, while the values of `i`, `n`, `l[a[j] - 1]`, and `r[a[k] - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 also remains valid.
