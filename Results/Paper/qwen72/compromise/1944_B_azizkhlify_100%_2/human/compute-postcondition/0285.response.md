Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the loop breaks. `k` is now equal to `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is true, `res` contains all elements `a[j]` where `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `re` is the count of such elements. If `re` equals `k`, the loop breaks before completing all iterations.***
