Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is the last element in `res`.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `i` is the last element in the list `res`.
   - `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - From the precondition, we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This means that the value of `a[i] - 1` must be an index in the list `r` that corresponds to the value 2.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` must be 3 (since `a[i] - 1` is 2).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will print `3` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **3 3**
