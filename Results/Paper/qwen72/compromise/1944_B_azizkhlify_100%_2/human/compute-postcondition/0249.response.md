Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `break` statement has been executed, so we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
