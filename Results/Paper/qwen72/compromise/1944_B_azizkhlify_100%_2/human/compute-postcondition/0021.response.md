The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is currently set to `2 * n - 1`, but for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
