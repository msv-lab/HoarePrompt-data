Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and the current value of `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a list containing the element `a[1]` if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is 1 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul`. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a list containing the elements `a[1]` and `a[2]` if `l[a[1] - 1]` and `l[a[2] - 1]` are both 1, otherwise `res` contains only `a[2]` if `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1, and remains an empty list otherwise, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is 1 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` is 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
