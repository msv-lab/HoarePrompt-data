Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[0] - 1` of the list `l` by 1. Since `i` is 0, the expression `a[i]` evaluates to `a[0]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0. The value of `i` also remains 0.
