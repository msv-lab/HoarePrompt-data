The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is in the range from `n` to `2 * n` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0 to ensure the range is valid.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n + 2`
- `n` must still be greater than 0

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
