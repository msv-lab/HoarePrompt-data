Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early), `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early), `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
