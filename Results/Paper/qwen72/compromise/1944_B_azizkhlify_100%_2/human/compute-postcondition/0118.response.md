The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1, the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1**
