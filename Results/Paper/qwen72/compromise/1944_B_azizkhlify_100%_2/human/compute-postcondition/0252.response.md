To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`.
   - If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the `break` statement has been executed, so we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
   - The `print` statement will output `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - The condition `l[a[i] - 1]` being incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and `r[a[k] - 1]` being incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1` suggests that `l` and `r` are lists that count occurrences of elements in `a` up to `n-1` and from `n` to `2n-1` respectively.
   - The condition `if l[a[i] - 1] is 2` and the subsequent actions (setting `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0, increasing `ul` by 2, and breaking if `ul` equals `k * 2`) are related to the state of `l` and `ul` but do not directly affect the value of `a[i]`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
   - The `print` statement will output this value twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `a[i]` is not explicitly provided, but we know it is the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index 2 of the list a)**
