The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is greater than 1

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n + 2`
- `n` must still be greater than 1, and `i` must be less than `2 * n` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and `ul` equals `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `ul` does not equal `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**
