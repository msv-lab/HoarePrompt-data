Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for checking if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, but string `c` does not.
   - The function iterates over each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found after iterating through all characters, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic is correct because if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, we can construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` by making that position uppercase and ensuring the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - The results of `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.
   - This function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The main block calls `func_2`, which processes the input and output as required.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining if a template exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct for handling multiple test cases and printing the results.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
