The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, this means `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `results` has at least one element, and `result` is the first element in `results`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the first element in `results`**
