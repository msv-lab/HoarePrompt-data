### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to reconstruct a palindromic array `a` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n + 1 - i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
   - We are given `n` and a list of subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the array `a`.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **func_1(a):**
     - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
     - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends them to the list `cts`.
     - The list `cts` is then sorted.
     - This function is correct for generating and sorting subarray sums.

   - **func_2(cts):**
     - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - It uses a stack-like approach to remove pairs of identical sums, leaving only the sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - This function correctly identifies the unique subarray sums that are needed to reconstruct the array `a`.

   - **func_3(odds, n):**
     - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
     - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
     - It iterates through the unique subarray sums (`odds`) and places the values in the middle of the array, ensuring the array remains palindromic.
     - This function correctly reconstructs the array `a` based on the unique subarray sums.

   - **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
     - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
     - It removes common elements from both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.
     - This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The functions work together to generate all subarray sums, identify the unique subarray sums, reconstruct the palindromic array, and find the missing subarray sum.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The original assessment correctly identified the correctness of each function and the overall solution.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly reconstructs the palindromic array `a` and finds the missing subarray sum.

Final: **True**
