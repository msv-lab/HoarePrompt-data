### Reasoning:

Let's break down the functions and their roles in solving the problem:

1. **func_1**:
   - **Purpose**: Generate all subarray sums of a given array `a` and return them sorted.
   - **Behavior**: This function iterates through all possible subarrays of `a`, calculates their sums, and appends these sums to a list `cts`. The list `cts` is then sorted.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly generates and sorts all subarray sums. It is essential for the next steps to identify the unique subarray sums.

2. **func_2**:
   - **Purpose**: Identify the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Behavior**: This function uses a stack-like approach to cancel out pairs of identical sums, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial because the missing subarray sum will be one of these unique sums.

3. **func_3**:
   - **Purpose**: Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`).
   - **Behavior**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array by placing the values in the middle of the array and ensuring that the array remains a palindrome. It correctly places the values symmetrically around the center.
   - **Correctness**: The logic of dividing the difference by 2 and placing it symmetrically around the center is sound. This function correctly reconstructs the palindrome array.

4. **func_4**:
   - **Purpose**: Find the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`.
   - **Behavior**: This function modifies both lists by removing the last elements that are equal until either the last elements are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. It returns the last element of `bigList`.
   - **Relevance**: This function is not directly used in the main logic of the problem. It is not called in the provided context, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Evaluation:

- **func_1** correctly generates and sorts all subarray sums.
- **func_2** correctly identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **func_3** correctly reconstructs the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums.
- **func_4** is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the functions, the program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
