### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` given the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is palindromic, meaning `a[i] = a[n - 1 - i]` for all `i`.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Generates all subarray sums of a given array and returns them sorted. This function helps in verifying the completeness of the subarray sums.
   - **func_2**: Filters out the unique elements from a list of subarray sums. This is useful for identifying the missing subarray sum.
   - **func_3**: Constructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums. It ensures that the array is symmetric.
   - **func_4**: Helps in finding the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted lists of subarray sums.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic involves sorting the given subarray sums and using `func_2` to identify the unique sums.
   - Depending on the number of unique sums, it either directly constructs the array or uses additional logic to find the missing sum.
   - The missing sum is then used to construct the final palindromic array using `func_3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the number of unique sums is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It correctly identifies and processes the missing sum to ensure the final array is palindromic.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The functions work together to ensure that the final output is a valid palindromic array that matches the given subarray sums.
   - The logic for finding the missing sum and constructing the array is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis of the functions and the main logic, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
