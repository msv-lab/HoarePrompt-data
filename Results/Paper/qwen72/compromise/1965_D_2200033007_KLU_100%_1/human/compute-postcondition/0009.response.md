Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, or one of the lists is empty. Every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`, but the last elements that were equal have been removed.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as both `bigList` and `smallList` are non-empty and their last elements are equal. Each iteration removes the last element from both lists. After all iterations, either the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, or one of the lists has become empty. In either case, the remaining elements in `smallList` are still present in `bigList`.
