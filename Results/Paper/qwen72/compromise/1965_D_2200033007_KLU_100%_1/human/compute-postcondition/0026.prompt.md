Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: odds is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, where n is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is a list of n zeros, prev is 0, idx is (n - 1) // 2.
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to `x`, `idx` is `idx - 1`, if `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx`, the element at index `idx` of `a` is set to `x`. Otherwise, if `idx` was not equal to `n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also set to `(x - prev) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the second element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1 - 1` (or `idx - 2`). If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now equal to the second element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also set to `(x - prev) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `odds`, `prev` is the third element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the third element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
