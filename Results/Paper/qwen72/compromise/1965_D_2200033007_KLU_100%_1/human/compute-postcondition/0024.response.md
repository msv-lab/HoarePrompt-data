Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least three elements. `x` is the third element of `odds`, `prev` is now the third element of `odds`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the third element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to be the same as `x`, which is the third element of `odds`.
- The conditions for setting `a[idx]` or `a[n - 1 - idx]` remain unchanged, but the value of `prev` is now the same as the third element of `odds`.
