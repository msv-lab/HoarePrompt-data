The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Given the initial conditions, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were equal before the last two elements of `bigList` were removed. After executing the code, the last element of `smallList` is removed, making `smallList` one element shorter.

Output State: **`bigList` is now a list of integers with its last three elements removed, `smallList` is now a list with its last three elements removed, and every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`. Both lists are non-empty, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were equal before the last two elements of `bigList` were removed.**
