Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the cumulative sum of all elements from the third element to the last element, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements from the third element to the last element, and `j` is `len(a)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is a palindrome array with at least three elements.
- **`cts`**: Initially contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element. After the loop, it also includes the cumulative sum of all elements from the third element to the last element.
- **`i`**: Remains 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sm`**: Initially 0, it accumulates the sum of all elements from the third element to the last element of `a`.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` reaches `len(a)`, which is the length of the list `a`.
