The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList` and `smallList`. Both `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, and every element in `smallList` is also in `bigList`. Both lists are non-empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are non-empty lists of integers where every element in `smallList` is also in `bigList`.
