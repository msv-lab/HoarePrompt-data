You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, where n is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `odds` remains a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums. The variable `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`. The variable `idx` is `0` or `-1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The list `a` is populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the list `odds`.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` which is populated based on the conditions described. Each element in `a` is either set to a value from the `odds` list or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The exact values in `a` depend on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `idx` is `0`, and if `n` is odd, `idx` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `a` where each element is either a value from `odds` or calculated based on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `a` which is populated based on the conditions described. Each element in `a` is either set to a value from the `odds` list or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The exact values in `a` depend on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `idx` is `0`, and if `n` is odd, `idx` is `-1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
