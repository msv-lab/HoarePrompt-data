Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the first element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The value of `x` is the second element of `odds`.
- The value of `prev` is the first element of `odds`.
- The value of `idx` is `idx - 1`.
- The value of `a[idx]` is already set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
