The function `func_4` takes two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are non-empty lists of integers, with every element in `smallList` also present in `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing the last elements that are equal until either the last elements are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty). If `smallList` becomes empty, the function returns the last element of `bigList`.
