### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates `a` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case, which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The first condition checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes). If so, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by simply adding one cube per move.
   - The second condition checks if `b` is less than `c`. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition checks if `a % 2` (the parity of the number of test cases) is equal to `b % 2` (the parity of the number of moves). This condition is incorrect. The parity of the number of test cases `a` should not influence the result. Instead, the correct condition should be whether `b % 2` (the parity of the number of moves) is equal to `c % 2` (the parity of the desired number of cubes). This is because the number of moves must have the same parity as the desired number of cubes to be achievable.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions. The output is case-insensitive, so 'Yes' and 'YES' are both acceptable.

### Correctness:
- The function is incorrect because it uses `a % 2` instead of `c % 2` in the third condition. This means the function will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
