Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length at least 2, `i` is 0, `count` is 0 or 1, `flag` is 0 or 1, `q` is `t`, and `t` remains the same. If the integer value of `s[0]` is less than the integer value of `s[1]`, `count` is 1 and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `flag` remains 0.***
