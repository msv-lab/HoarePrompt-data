Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `q` is `t + 1`.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `flag` is 0.
   - `count` is the number of positions in `s` where the character at position `i` is different from the character at position `i + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(count + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `s` is a binary string, meaning it consists of characters '0' and '1'.
   - `i` is the second-to-last index of the string `s` because `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `count` is the number of positions in `s` where the character at position `i` is different from the character at position `i + 1`. Since `i` is the second-to-last index, `i + 1` is the last index of the string.
   - The code snippet prints `count + 1`.

4. **Determine `count`:**
   - `count` is 1 if the character at position `i` (second-to-last character) is different from the character at position `i + 1` (last character).
   - `count` is 0 if the character at position `i` is the same as the character at position `i + 1`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `count` is 1, then `count + 1` will be 2.
   - If `count` is 0, then `count + 1` will be 1.

Therefore, the output will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether the second-to-last character of `s` is different from the last character.

Output: **1 or 2 (where 1 is printed if the second-to-last character of `s` is the same as the last character, and 2 is printed if they are different)**
