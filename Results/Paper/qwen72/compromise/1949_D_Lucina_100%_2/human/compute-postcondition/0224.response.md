Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. The length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `j` is 1. If the character at position `j - 1` (which is position 0) of the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[1]`. If the character at position `j - 1` (which is position 0) of the string `xx[i]` is '?', and if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.***
