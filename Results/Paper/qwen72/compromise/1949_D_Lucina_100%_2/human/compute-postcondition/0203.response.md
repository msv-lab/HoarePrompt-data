Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0.**
