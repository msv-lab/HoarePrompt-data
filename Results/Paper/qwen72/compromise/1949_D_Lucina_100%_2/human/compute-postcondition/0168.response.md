The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The initial state specifies that `nx` is a string, and the conditions for appending 'F' or 'S' are not directly relevant to the current code snippet. Therefore, the value of `nx` is updated by appending 'F' to it, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original string `nx` appended with 'F'.**
