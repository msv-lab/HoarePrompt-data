Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2. If `xx[2][1]` is not '?', `nx` is `nx` + `xx[2][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string, and if `i` or `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is appended with 'F'. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is appended with 'S'.***
