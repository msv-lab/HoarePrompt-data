Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.
- The value of `j` remains 3.
- The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'F' to its previous value. The previous value of `nx` depends on the conditions given in the initial state, but regardless of those conditions, 'F' is concatenated to `nx`. Therefore, the new value of `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with 'F'.
