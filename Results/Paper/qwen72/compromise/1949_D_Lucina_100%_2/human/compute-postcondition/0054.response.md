Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string. If `x[1]` is 'F', `a[j]` and `a[i]` are both incremented by 1. If `x[1]` is 'S', `b[j]` and `b[i]` are both incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is incremented by 1 again.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `j`, `xx`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for incrementing `a[j]`, `a[i]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]` based on `x[1]` remain valid.
- If `x[1]` is 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1 again, making the total increment for `b[i]` 2.
