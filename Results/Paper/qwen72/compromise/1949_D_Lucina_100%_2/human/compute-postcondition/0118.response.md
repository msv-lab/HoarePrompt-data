The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented to 2, and `n` remains the same (2 <= n <= 24). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same (3 <= n <= 24)**
