The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `a` by 1, given that `i` is 2. The initial state specifies that `j` is 2, and `i` is used in the code, so we can infer that `i` is also 2. The value at index 1 of `a` is incremented by 1, regardless of the value of `x[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.**
