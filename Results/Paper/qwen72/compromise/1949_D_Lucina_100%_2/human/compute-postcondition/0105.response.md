Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings. If `a[3]` is greater than 0 and `b[3]` is equal to 0, `sa` is a list containing `[2, 3]` and `sb` is a list containing the values `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing `[3]` and `sb` is a list containing the value `2` appended to it.***
