The code snippet `nx += 'F'` attempts to concatenate the string `'F'` to a variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which means this operation will result in a `NameError` because `nx` is being used before it is assigned a value.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, and a `NameError` occurs because `nx` is not defined.**
