Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, the character at position `i` in the string `xx` at index `j - 1` is `?`, and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.**

The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`, which was initially an empty string. Therefore, `nx` is now 'F'. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the conditions regarding `xx` and `sa` remain unchanged.
