Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is a string and is appended with 'S'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.
- The value of `j` remains 3.
- The value of `nx` is a string, and it is appended with 'S'. Therefore, `nx` now includes the character 'S' at the end of its previous value.
