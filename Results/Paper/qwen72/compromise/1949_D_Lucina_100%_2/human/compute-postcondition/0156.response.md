Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, and the character at position `i` in the string `xx` at index `j - 1` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and `j` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.**
