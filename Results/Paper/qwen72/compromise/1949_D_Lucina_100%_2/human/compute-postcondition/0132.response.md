Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is '?'. If either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
