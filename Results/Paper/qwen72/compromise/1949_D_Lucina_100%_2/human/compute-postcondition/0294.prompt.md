You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.'. At most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    b = [0] * (n + 1)

The list `xx` contains `n + 1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings. The lists `a` and `b` are updated such that for each row `i` and column `j` in the input grid, if the character at position (i, j) is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1. Similarly, if the character at position (i, j) is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` at index 0 remain 0.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a symmetric matrix represented as a list of n strings, each of length n, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each character in the matrix can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with the diagonal always being '.' and at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters being 'F' or 'S'. The function returns a value based on the input matrix, but the specific return value is not defined in the constraints.
