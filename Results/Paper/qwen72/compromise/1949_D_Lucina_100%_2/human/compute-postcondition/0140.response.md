To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24
- `j` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Let's increment `j` by 1:
- `j` is now 3

Since `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `j` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3**
