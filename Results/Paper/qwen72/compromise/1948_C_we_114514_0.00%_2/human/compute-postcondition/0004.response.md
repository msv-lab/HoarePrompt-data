The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even) and two strings of length `n`, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row in the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. It returns a list `results` with 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row in the grid.**
