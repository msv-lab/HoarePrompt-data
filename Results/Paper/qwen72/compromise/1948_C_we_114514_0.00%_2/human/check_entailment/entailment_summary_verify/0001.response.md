### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `row1` and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to keep track of whether the robot can reach the last cell in the first and second rows, respectively.
   - The robot starts in the first row at the first column, so `reachable_first_row` is initially set to `True`.

3. **Movement Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot cannot move further in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the corresponding cell in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).
   - If the robot is currently in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (this is redundant but doesn't affect correctness).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, and the program appends `YES` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends `NO`.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Check:**
  - The check `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` in the second row processing is redundant because `reachable_second_row` is already `True` if the robot reaches the second row. This does not affect the correctness of the program but can be optimized.
- **Logical Flaw:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot can move between rows. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility that the robot can move from the second row back to the first row and continue moving right.

### Correctness:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical flaw. The program's current logic only allows the robot to move from the first row to the second row once and does not consider the possibility of the robot moving back and forth between rows. This is a critical oversight because the robot can potentially move back to the first row from the second row if the arrow in the second row points to the left.

### Conclusion:
The program needs to be modified to correctly handle the movement between rows and ensure that the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` by considering all possible movements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the robot's ability to move back and forth between rows, which is essential for determining whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.
