The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `r` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1 (relevant to the loop head)
- `f` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `num` is a list of integers provided by the user (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `j` is the index of the first inequality found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2` (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num` (now reversed again to its original order) (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num` (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `symb2` is the first integer in the list `num` (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2` (relevant to the loop head, but will be reset by the loop)
- `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `ck` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `cn` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head)

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the loop, so we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
