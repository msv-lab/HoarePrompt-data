Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` must be greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, and all other variables (`t`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged. If `num[1]` and `num[2]` are not equal, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
