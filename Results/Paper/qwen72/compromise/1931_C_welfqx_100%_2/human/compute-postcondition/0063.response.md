To determine what will be printed by the `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `f` is 1.
   - `num` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`.
   - `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
   - `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`.
   - `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`.
   - `i` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `i` is `n-2`.
   - `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed.
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `num` is a list of integers.
   - `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
   - `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
   - `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements in `onum` starting from the first element.
   - `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements in `num` starting from the first element, plus the count of consecutive equal elements in `onum` starting from the first element if `symb1` equals `symb2`.

3. **Calculating `ck` and `cn`:**
   - `ck` is determined by counting consecutive equal elements in `onum` starting from the first element.
   - If `symb1` equals `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of the counts of consecutive equal elements in `num` and `onum` starting from their respective first elements.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement will print the value of `n` minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`.

Given the initial state and the logic described, the output will be:

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is the length of the list `num`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in `num` plus the count of consecutive equal elements in `onum` if `symb1` equals `symb2`, and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in `onum`)**

This output is the result of the `print` statement based on the given initial state and the logic for calculating `cn` and `ck`.
