Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `r` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `f` will be 1 if all elements in the list `num` are equal. If any two consecutive elements are not equal, `f` will be set to 0 and the loop will break.
- The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `j` will be `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `j` will be the index of the first element that is not equal to its next element.
