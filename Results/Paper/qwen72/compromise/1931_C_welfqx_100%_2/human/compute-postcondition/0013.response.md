Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `f` is set to 0.***
