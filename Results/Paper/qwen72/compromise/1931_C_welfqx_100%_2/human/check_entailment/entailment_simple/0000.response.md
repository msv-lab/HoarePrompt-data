### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `num`.
   - It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one. If all elements are the same, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because no operation is needed if the array is already uniform.

2. **Handling Single Element Arrays:**
   - If `n` is `1`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single-element array is already uniform.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program creates a reversed copy of the array `onum`.
   - It initializes two counters `cn` and `ck` to count the number of consecutive elements starting from the beginning and the end of the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array `num` to count the number of consecutive elements from the start (`cn`).
   - It iterates through the reversed array `onum` to count the number of consecutive elements from the end (`ck`).

4. **Combining Consecutive Counts:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`symb1 == symb2`), it adds the counts `cn` and `ck` together. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the longest segment of consecutive elements can be formed by combining the counts from both ends.

5. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program prints `n - max(cn, ck)`. This is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by selecting the longest segment of consecutive elements and assigning the remaining elements the value of the first or last element in that segment.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
- It correctly handles the case where the array has only one element.
- The logic for counting consecutive elements from both ends and combining them if the first and last elements are the same is correct.
- The final calculation of the minimum cost is correct because it subtracts the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements from the total length of the array, which gives the number of elements that need to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
