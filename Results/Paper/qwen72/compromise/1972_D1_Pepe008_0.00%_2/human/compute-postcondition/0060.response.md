Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
- For each iteration, the variable `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is added to `suma`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1` because the loop runs up to `b` inclusive.
- The final value of `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values computed during the loop.

Thus, the output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
