To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, b + 1)`.
   - The variable `b` is used in the range expression.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, b + 1)` generates at least one value.
   - For `range(1, b + 1)` to generate at least one value, `b + 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `b` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should start at 1, as specified by the range.

4. **Verify Other States:**
   - The other states (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `suma`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `b` must be at least 1.
- `i` starts at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0**
