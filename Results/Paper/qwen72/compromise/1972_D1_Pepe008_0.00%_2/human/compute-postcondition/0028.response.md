Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\), and the expression `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0.**
