Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`. The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition `int((j+i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j))) == 0` are printed, where 1 <= i <= a and 4 <= j <= b.**
