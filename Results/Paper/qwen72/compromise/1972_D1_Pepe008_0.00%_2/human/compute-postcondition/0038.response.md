The value of `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is calculated as \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `x`, `x` is \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\)**.
