Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\).**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(i = b\).
- For each iteration, the variable `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), then `x` is added to `suma`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `b`, and `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values computed during the loop.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, and `info` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
