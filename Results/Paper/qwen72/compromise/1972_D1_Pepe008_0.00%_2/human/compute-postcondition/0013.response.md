Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`.
- Initially, `suma` was 0 and `x` is calculated as `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.
- After executing the code, `suma` is now equal to `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.
