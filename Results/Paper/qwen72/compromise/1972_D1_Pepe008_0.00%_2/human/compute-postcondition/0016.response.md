Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `suma` remains the same: if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\); otherwise, `suma` remains 0.
