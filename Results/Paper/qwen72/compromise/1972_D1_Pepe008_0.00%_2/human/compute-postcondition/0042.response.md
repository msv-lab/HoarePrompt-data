The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `T` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop where `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive, provided that `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each iteration.**
