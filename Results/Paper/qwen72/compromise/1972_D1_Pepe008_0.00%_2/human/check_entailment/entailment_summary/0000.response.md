Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the possible values of `b` and calculating a value `x` using a specific formula. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The nested loop in the commented section (which is not executed) incorrectly starts from 4 instead of 1 for the variable `j`. This would miss many valid pairs.

2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate `x` is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not reflect this condition.

3. **Subtraction of 1**: The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which is not justified by the problem statement. There is no indication that the result should be reduced by 1.

4. **Variable Names**: The variables `a` and `b` are used in the input, but the problem statement uses `n` and `m`. While this is not a correctness issue, it can lead to confusion.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
