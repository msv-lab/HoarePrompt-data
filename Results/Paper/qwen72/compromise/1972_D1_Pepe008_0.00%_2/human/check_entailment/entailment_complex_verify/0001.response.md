### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - However, this formula is not derived from the problem statement's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be an ad-hoc formula that may not accurately count the valid pairs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) by checking the condition before adding to `suma`.
   - The final result is `suma - 1`, which seems to be an adjustment for some off-by-one error or boundary condition.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program's logic and formula do not align with the problem requirements. The formula used does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The commented-out code suggests that there was an earlier attempt to directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which was later replaced by the current formula. This replacement might have introduced errors.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as it uses an incorrect formula to count the valid pairs.
   - The logic and the formula used are inconsistent with the problem requirements.
