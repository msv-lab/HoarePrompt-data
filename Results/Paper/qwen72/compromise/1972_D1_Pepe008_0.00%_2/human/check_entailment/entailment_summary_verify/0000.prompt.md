You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of inputs, processes them, and prints a result for each set of inputs. Specifically, it first reads an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and prints the result of this calculation minus one. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console. After the function concludes, the state includes the processed inputs and the printed results, but the original input variables `n` and `m` are not affected.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b). Specifically, the loop and the calculation of `x` do not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issue:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs by using the formula:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```
This formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case where \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly check the condition for each pair.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs (a, b) and checks the condition directly, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
