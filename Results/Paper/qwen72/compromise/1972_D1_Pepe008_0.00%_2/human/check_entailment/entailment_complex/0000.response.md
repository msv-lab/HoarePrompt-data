Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `T` and then processing each test case with two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic used in the program to calculate the number of valid pairs seems to be incorrect.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - It calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula and Logic**:
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not directly correspond to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` implies that `a + b` should be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. This is not captured by the current logic in the program.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `(1, 1)`, the only valid pair is `(1, 1)`, which satisfies the condition.
   - For the test case `(2, 3)`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, which satisfy the condition.
   - The current logic in the program does not correctly identify these pairs.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic does not correctly implement the required condition, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
