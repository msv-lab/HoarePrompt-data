You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of operation ranges. It appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends the same range again. The function then calls another function `func_2` with `r`, `l`, and `ops`. Finally, it fills the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`, ensuring the minimum value in this sublist is `n`. The function returns the modified `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray `a[l:r]`, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in this subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function aims to find the subarray `a[l:r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - The MEX of a subarray is approximated as `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray `a[r:l+1]` to the same value.
     - It is not clear why this function is necessary, as it does not compute the MEX or update the array.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function updates the array `lst` and the list of operations `ops` to set the subarray `a[r:l+1]` to the MEX value.
     - It appends the operation to `ops` and then updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value.
     - The MEX value is approximated as `n` (the length of the subarray), which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The MEX calculation is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
     - This function does not correctly identify the subarray that maximizes the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function does not contribute to the correct solution. It recursively adds operations without computing the MEX or updating the array.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - The MEX calculation is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not `n`.
     - The function updates the array and operations but does not ensure the correct MEX value is used.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it uses incorrect methods to compute the MEX and does not ensure the operations are performed correctly to maximize the sum of the array.
