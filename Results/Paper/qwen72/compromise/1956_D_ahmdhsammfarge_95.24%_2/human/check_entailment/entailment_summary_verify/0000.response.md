### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** This function is intended to find the optimal range `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum of the array after performing the MEX operation.
   - **Implementation:** The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a potential new sum by replacing the subarray with a value. However, it does not compute the MEX value for the subarray. Instead, it replaces the subarray with `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not the MEX value.
   - **Issue:** The MEX value is not computed, and the sum calculation is incorrect. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** This function is intended to recursively generate operations to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to a certain value.
   - **Implementation:** The function appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and recursively calls itself with `l - 1`.
   - **Issue:** The function does not correctly handle the MEX computation or the actual modification of the array. It simply appends the same range multiple times, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_3` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** This function is intended to perform the MEX operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and modify the array accordingly.
   - **Implementation:** The function appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times and calls `func_2` to generate more operations. It then sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`.
   - **Issue:** The function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It sets the subarray to `n` without checking if `n` is the correct MEX value. Additionally, the recursive calls to `func_2` do not contribute to the correct solution.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  1 3 9
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  13 0
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  - The program does not correctly compute the MEX value and may produce an incorrect sequence of operations or sum.
  - For example, `func_1` will incorrectly calculate the potential sum by replacing subarrays with `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not the MEX value.
  - `func_3` will set the subarray to `n` without considering the MEX value, leading to incorrect modifications.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. The critical issue is the lack of MEX computation in `func_1` and the incorrect modification of the array in `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
