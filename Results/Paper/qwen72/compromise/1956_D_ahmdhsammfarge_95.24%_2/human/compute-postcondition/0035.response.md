Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 4 < n â‰¤ 18, `r` is [1, 4], `l` is 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 25, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `over_sum` is updated to be equal to the current value of `sm`.
- All other variables (`lst`, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
