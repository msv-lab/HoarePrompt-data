Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is [1, 2], `l` is 2, `over_sum` is the current value of `sm`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- `over_sum` is updated to the current value of `sm`.
- The other variables (`lst`, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged.
- The current value of `sm` is greater than the previous value of `over_sum`, so `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.
