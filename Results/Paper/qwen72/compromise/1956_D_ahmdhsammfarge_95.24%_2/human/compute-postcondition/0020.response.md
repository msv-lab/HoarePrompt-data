The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `lst`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `lst` must still have a length of at least 1 to ensure `i` is less than the length of `lst`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, and `i` is 1**
