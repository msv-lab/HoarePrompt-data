Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is 2, and `l` is 3.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is updated to the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` (`lst[:i]`), plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` (`lst[j + 1:]`), plus 9 (which is `(j - i + 1) ** 2`).
- The values of `i` and `j` remain 2 and 4, respectively.
- The values of `r` and `l` remain 2 and 3, respectively.
- The condition `if sm > over_sum` is still valid, and if true, `over_sum` will be updated to the new value of `sm`.
