Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is [1, 3], `l` is 3, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 16.**
