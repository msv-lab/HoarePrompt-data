Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- `lst` remains a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `r` remains 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 3.
- `sm` is updated to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.
- The condition for `l` remains the same: if `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.
