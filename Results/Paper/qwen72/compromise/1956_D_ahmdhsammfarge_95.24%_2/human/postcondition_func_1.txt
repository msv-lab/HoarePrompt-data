The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l`, and a list `ops`. It ensures that `0 <= r <= l < n`. If `r` equals `l`, it appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and returns. If `r` is not equal to `l`, it recursively calls itself twice with the parameters `r` and `l - 1`, and appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` between the recursive calls. The function does not return any value, but modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers. After the function concludes, `ops` contains multiple pairs `[r + 1, l + 1]` for each valid `r` and `l` combination, where `r` is less than or equal to `l`.
