Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `a - 3`, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - 2 * b[a-2]`, `b[a]` is `b[a] - b[a-2]`, and `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are 0. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3`.
- After each iteration, the value of `b[i]` is set to 0.
- The values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are updated based on the value of `b[i]` before it is set to 0.
- Specifically, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is reduced by `b[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, and `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`.
- The final values of `b[a-1]` and `b[a]` are also affected by the loop, with `b[a-1]` being `b[a-1] - 2 * b[a-2]` and `b[a]` being `b[a] - b[a-2]`.
- If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output.
- If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
