Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`.
- Since `i` is 0, the specific update is `b[1] -= b[0] * 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid: if `b[i]` (which is `b[0]`) is less than 0, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues.
