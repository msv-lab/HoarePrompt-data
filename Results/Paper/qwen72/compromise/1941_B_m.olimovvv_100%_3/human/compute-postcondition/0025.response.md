Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to `n - 3`, `b[n-2]` is `b[n-2] - sum(b[i] for i in range(0, n-2, 1))`, `b[n-1]` is `b[n-1] - sum(b[i] for i in range(0, n-1, 1))`. If `b[n-2]` is not 0 or `b[n-1]` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`.
- For each iteration, `b[i]` is set to 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is updated by subtracting `2 * b[i]` from its current value.
- `b[i + 2]` is updated by subtracting `b[i]` from its current value.
- After the loop completes, `b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]` are checked. If either of them is not 0, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
- The final state of `b` is such that all elements from `b[0]` to `b[n-3]` are 0, and `b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]` are adjusted based on the sum of the elements that were set to 0 during the loop.
