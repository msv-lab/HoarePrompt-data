The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must still have at least 3 elements (since `a - 2` must be greater than `i`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `a` must still have at least 3 elements, so `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`**.
