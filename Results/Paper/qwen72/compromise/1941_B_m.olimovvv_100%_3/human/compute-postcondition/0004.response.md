Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.**
