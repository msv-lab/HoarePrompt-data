Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the way it processes the array. Specifically, the approach of subtracting `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]` does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the code incorrectly modifies the array in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the array elements become negative, which is a critical part of the problem. The operation should only be applied if the elements can be decremented without becoming negative.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array can be made zero
        possible = True
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if a[i] > 0:
                # Calculate the number of operations needed
                operations = a[i]
                if a[i + 1] < 2 * operations or a[i + 2] < operations:
                    possible = False
                    break
                # Apply the operations
                a[i + 1] -= 2 * operations
                a[i + 2] -= operations
                a[i] = 0
        
        # Check the last two elements
        if a[-1] != 0 or a[-2] != 0:
            possible = False
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')

# Example usage
can_make_zero()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if the array can be made zero without any elements becoming negative.
