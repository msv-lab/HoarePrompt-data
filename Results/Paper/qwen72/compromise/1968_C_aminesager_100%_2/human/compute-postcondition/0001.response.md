The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is non-zero and the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 for each test case, and `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500 for each test case**
