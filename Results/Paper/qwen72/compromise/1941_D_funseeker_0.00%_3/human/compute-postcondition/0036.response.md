The only objects in the loop head are `q` and `ans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans`. If `ans` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again for the next element in `ans`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `q` is the current element being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one more element, and `q` must be the next element in `ans`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least two elements. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
