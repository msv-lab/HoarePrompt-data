Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least two elements. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q - r) % n`, so after this code, it will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '0', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, so after this code, it will still contain only `(q + r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `q` is the next element in `ans`.
