The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the list `ans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans` and the current value of `q`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must contain at least two elements, and `q` is the second element in `ans`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least two elements, but `q` must now be the third element in `ans`.

State: **`ans` must contain at least three elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains both the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
