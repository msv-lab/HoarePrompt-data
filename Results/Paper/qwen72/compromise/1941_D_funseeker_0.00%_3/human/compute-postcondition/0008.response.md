Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`; `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the integer `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The set `ans` still contains the integer `x`.
- The integer `r` and the string `c` remain as they were initially.
- `temp` is no longer an empty set; it now contains the integer `(q + r) % n`.
