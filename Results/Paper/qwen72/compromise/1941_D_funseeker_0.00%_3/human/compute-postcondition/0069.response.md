Output State: **`ans` must contain all the elements it initially contained. `temp` will contain the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`, depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '0', `temp` will contain only the results of `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain the results of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `_` will be equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `ans` will still contain all the elements it had at the start.
- The variable `temp` will have been populated with the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`, based on the value of `c`.
- The variable `_` will be equal to the number of elements in `ans`.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
