Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**

The code snippet `ans = temp` updates the value of `ans` to be an empty set, as `temp` is initially an empty set. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, as do the values of `r` and `c`.
