Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the current player number becomes 0 after a counterclockwise throw. According to the problem description, player numbers are 1-indexed, so the player number should never be 0. However, the program uses the modulo operation, which can result in 0, and then it only corrects this by converting 0 to `n` at the end. This can lead to incorrect results if the player number becomes 0 during the process and is not immediately corrected.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 1
2 1
1 1
```

- Initially, the ball is with player 1.
- First throw: `2 1` (counterclockwise). The ball moves to player `(1 - 2) % 5 = 4`.
- Second throw: `1 1` (counterclockwise). The ball moves to player `(4 - 1) % 5 = 3`.

The correct output should be:
```
1
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
1
4
```

This is because the program does not immediately correct the player number when it becomes 0 during the process. It only corrects it at the end, which can lead to incorrect results.
