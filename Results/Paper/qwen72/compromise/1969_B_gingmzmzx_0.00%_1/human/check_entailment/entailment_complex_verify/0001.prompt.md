You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

        zeroes = s.count(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and s is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case. The sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the final `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the final `s`, number of 1s in the final `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in the final `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the final `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates a value `ans`. This value is computed based on the positions of 0s and 1s in the string, specifically counting the number of 1s before each 0 and the total number of 0s and 1s in the string. The function prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes `n` being 0, `s` being a list of integers representing the last processed binary string, and `ans` being the last calculated value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`, it updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
   - If the current character `c` is 0:
     - It adds 1 to `ans` if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character `c` is 1:
     - It adds the difference between the total number of zeroes and the number of zeroes encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- The key idea is to count the number of 1s that need to be moved past 0s to achieve a sorted string.
- The program correctly handles the counting and updating of the cost based on the positions of 0s and 1s in the string.

### Verification:
- For the given example test cases:
  - "10" -> The cost is 2 because we can shift the entire string once.
  - "0000" -> The cost is 0 because the string is already sorted.
  - "11000" -> The cost is 9, which matches the optimal strategy described.
  - "101011" -> The cost is 5, which is correct.
  - "01101001" -> The cost is 11, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the described operations.
