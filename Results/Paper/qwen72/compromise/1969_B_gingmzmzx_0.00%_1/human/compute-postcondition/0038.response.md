The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `s` remains a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `zeroes` remains the number of 0s in the current `s`.
- `c` is the second element of `s`.

If `c` is 0:
- `cnt` was initially [1, 0].
- After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes [2, 0].
- `ans` remains 0.

If `c` is 1:
- `cnt` was initially [0, 1].
- After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes [0, 2].
- `ans` remains `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, then `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
