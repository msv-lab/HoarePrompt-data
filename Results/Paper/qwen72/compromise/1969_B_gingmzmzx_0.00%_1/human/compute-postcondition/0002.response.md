The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then converts each character in the string to an integer, storing the result in a list called `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case
- The sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is now a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, corresponding to the characters in the input string.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, the sum of the lengths of lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0**
