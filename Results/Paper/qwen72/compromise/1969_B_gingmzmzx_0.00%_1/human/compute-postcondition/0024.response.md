Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `zeroes` and `cnt`:**
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated as the product of the number of 1s in `s` and the number of 0s in `s`.
   - Mathematically, `ans = cnt[0] * cnt[1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list s)**
