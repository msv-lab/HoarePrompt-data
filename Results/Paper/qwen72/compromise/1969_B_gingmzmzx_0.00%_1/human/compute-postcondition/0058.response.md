Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0] if `c` is 0 or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`, and `c` is 1***
