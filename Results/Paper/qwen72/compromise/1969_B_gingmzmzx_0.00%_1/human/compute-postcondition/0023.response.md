Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`s`**: Remains a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0.
- **`zeroes`**: Still represents the number of 0s in `s`.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the value based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically:
  - For each 0 in `s`, `ans` increases by 1 if there is at least one 1 before it.
  - For each 1 in `s`, `ans` increases by the number of 0s that have not been counted yet (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

After the loop completes, `ans` will be the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is 1 and `s[j]` is 0, which is equivalent to the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s`.
