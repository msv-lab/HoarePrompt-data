The function `func_1` seems to be missing the parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `s`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case, where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`.

Since the output description is not provided, I'll assume that the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the binary string `s` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer) and `s` (a binary string). It processes `t` test cases, each with a binary string `s`, and returns a result based on the content of the binary string `s` for each test case.**
