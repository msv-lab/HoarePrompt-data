The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` was initially set to `zeroes`.
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt[0]` is 0.

So, the new value of `ans` will be `zeroes + (zeroes - 0)`, which simplifies to `2 * zeroes`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `c`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `ans` is `2 * zeroes`, `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2].**
