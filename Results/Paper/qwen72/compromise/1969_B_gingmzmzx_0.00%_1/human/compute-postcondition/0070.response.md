Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `c` is the second element in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 2] if `c` is 0, or `cnt` is [0, 3] if `c` is 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes + 2`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is `3 * zeroes`.***
