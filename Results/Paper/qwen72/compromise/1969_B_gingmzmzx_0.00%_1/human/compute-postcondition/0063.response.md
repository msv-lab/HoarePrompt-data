The code snippet checks if the second element of the `cnt` list is greater than 0. If true, it increments `ans` by 1; otherwise, it does nothing.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements
- `n` is 1
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`
- `ans` is `zeroes`
- `c` is 1
- `cnt` is [0, 2]

Since `cnt[1]` is 2, which is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `ans` is `zeroes` + 1, `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2].**
