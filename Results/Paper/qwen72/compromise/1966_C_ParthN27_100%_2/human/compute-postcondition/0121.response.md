The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters but reads input from the standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), indicating the number of piles, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The exact return value for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function will return some form of output based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case includes the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. It processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.**
