Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated using the XOR operation with 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, `ans ^= 1` changes `ans` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
