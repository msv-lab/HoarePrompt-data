Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` (which is 1) of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained the first element of `arr`, and now it contains both the first and the second elements of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
