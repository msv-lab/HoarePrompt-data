The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the loop still has one fewer iteration remaining.

Output State: **The loop has one fewer iteration remaining, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
