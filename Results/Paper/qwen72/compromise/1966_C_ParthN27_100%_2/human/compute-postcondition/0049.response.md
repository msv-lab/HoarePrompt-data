Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains the first, second, and third integers from `arr`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the integer at index `i` (which is 2) from the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `s` initially contains the first and second integers from `arr`, after executing the code, `s` will contain the first, second, and third integers from `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
