Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1**

The value of `ans` is updated to 1 using the XOR operation with 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
