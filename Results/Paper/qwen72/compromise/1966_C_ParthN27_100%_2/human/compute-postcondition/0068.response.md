Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.***
