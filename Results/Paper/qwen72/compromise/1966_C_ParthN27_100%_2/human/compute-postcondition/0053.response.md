Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1.**

The code snippet `s = [0] + s` prepends the integer 0 to the list `s`, which was initially a sorted list of integers from `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
