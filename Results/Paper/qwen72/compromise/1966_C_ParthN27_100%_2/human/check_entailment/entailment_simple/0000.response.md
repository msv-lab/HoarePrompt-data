### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Set and Sorting**: The program then creates a set `s` from the elements in `arr` to remove duplicates and sorts the set. This is a valid approach because the game's outcome depends on the unique values in the piles, not their multiplicity.

3. **Adding 0 to the Set**: The program adds `0` to the set `s` and converts it back to a list. This is done to handle edge cases where the smallest pile might be greater than 1, and to simplify the logic of checking the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Initial Answer**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `1`, which represents Alice's turn. The idea is to use the XOR operation to toggle between Alice and Bob based on the conditions of the game.

5. **Loop to Determine Winner**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `s` from index 1 to `n-1` (excluding the last element).
   - It checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1. If so, it breaks the loop, indicating that the game can be won by the current player (Alice or Bob).
   - If the difference is at most 1, it toggles the `ans` variable using the XOR operation.

6. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints "Alice" if `ans` is `1` and "Bob" if `ans` is `0`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Single Unique Value**: If the set `s` contains only one unique value (after adding 0), the length of `s` will be 2. In this case, Alice can always win by removing all stones in one move, so the program correctly prints "Alice".

- **Multiple Unique Values**: If there are multiple unique values, the program checks the differences between consecutive elements. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and the current player (Alice or Bob) wins. This is because the player can choose a `k` that will leave the opponent in a losing position.

- **Consecutive Differences**: If all differences between consecutive elements are at most 1, the loop will complete without breaking, and the `ans` variable will toggle based on the number of unique values. This is a correct approach because the game can be reduced to a Nim game with a single pile, where the player who starts with an odd number of unique values (excluding 0) will win.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the input, processes the unique values, and determines the winner based on the game's rules. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
