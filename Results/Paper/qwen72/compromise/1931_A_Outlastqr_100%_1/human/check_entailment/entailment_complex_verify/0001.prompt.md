You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a single integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded word.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop prints a series of words based on the value of `n` for each iteration. After all iterations, the value of `n` and `word` will be the last values assigned during the final iteration. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the user and prints a decoded word based on the value of `n`. The decoded word is determined by a specific mapping: if `n` is greater than 52, the word is formed by appending the corresponding character from the alphabet (offset by 53) followed by 'zz'; if `n` is between 28 and 52, the word is 'a' followed by the corresponding character (offset by 28) and 'z'; if `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'; otherwise, the word is 'aa' followed by the corresponding character (offset by 3). After all iterations, the function completes, and the `alphabet` string remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums to a given integer \( n \).
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code uses a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and determines the lexicographically smallest word that sums to \( n \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **If \( n > 52 \):**
     - The maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26). Therefore, if \( n > 52 \), the first letter must be at least 'r' (18th letter) to ensure the sum can be achieved.
     - The code adds the letter corresponding to \( n - 53 \) (since 'r' is the 18th letter, \( n - 53 \) gives the correct index) followed by 'zz'.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using the smallest possible first letter and 'zz' for the remaining two letters.

   - **If \( 27 < n \leq 52 \):**
     - The maximum sum of one letter is 26. Therefore, if \( 27 < n \leq 52 \), the first letter must be 'a' and the second letter must be at least 'a' to ensure the sum can be achieved.
     - The code adds 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to \( n - 28 \) (since 'a' is the 1st letter, \( n - 28 \) gives the correct index) and 'z'.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using 'a' as the first letter and the smallest possible second letter followed by 'z'.

   - **If \( n == 27 \):**
     - The sum 27 can be achieved with the word 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
     - The code correctly handles this special case by setting the word to 'aay'.

   - **If \( n \leq 26 \):**
     - The sum \( n \) can be achieved with the word 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to \( n - 3 \) (since 'a' is the 1st letter, \( n - 3 \) gives the correct index).
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using 'aa' as the first two letters and the smallest possible third letter.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles all the edge cases and the general cases.
   - The conditions and logic used to construct the word are sound and ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
