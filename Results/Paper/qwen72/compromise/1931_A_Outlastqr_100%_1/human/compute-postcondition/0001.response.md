The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which is the input value for the loop. For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer, as `range()` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the input value. Given that the function should accept a single integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, the input value must be within this range for the loop to execute properly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. However, since the function specifies that `n` should be between 3 and 78, the input value must be within this range. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `i` is 0**
