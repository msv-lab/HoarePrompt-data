The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, from the user. It processes the input to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column, storing these counts in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function then identifies rows or columns where 'F' or 'S' characters are exclusively present and stores their indices in lists `sa` and `sb`. If the number of indices in `sa` is greater than or equal to those in `sb`, it modifies and prints each row of the input list by replacing '?' characters with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the number of indices in `sa` is less than those in `sb`, it modifies and prints each row by replacing '?' characters with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise. The original input list and the counts in `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the function.
