### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Counting**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
   - For each row, it iterates through the characters and updates the counts in `a` and `b` accordingly.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` contain the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions involving the i-th scenario.

3. **Identifying Exclusive Scenarios**:
   - The program identifies scenarios that are exclusively involved in 'F' transitions (stored in `sa`) and those exclusively involved in 'S' transitions (stored in `sb`).
   - This step is crucial for ensuring that the transition videos are balanced.

4. **Balancing the Transitions**:
   - If the number of scenarios in `sa` is greater than or equal to those in `sb`, it replaces '?' characters in the input with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise.
   - If the number of scenarios in `sa` is less than those in `sb`, it replaces '?' characters with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.
   - This approach aims to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified transition video plan, ensuring that the original 'F' and 'S' characters remain unchanged and '?' characters are replaced appropriately.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Transitions**:
  - The program does not guarantee that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for all permutations of scenarios.
  - The logic of replacing '?' characters based on the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `sb` is flawed. It does not consider the overall sequence of transitions for any permutation of scenarios.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the input might already have a large number of 'F' or 'S' transitions, which could make it difficult to balance the transitions without violating the \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) constraint.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
