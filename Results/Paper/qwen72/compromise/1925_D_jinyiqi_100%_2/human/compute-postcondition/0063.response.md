Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must be at least as large as the total number of iterations the loop has run.
- The loop index `i` will be one less than the total number of iterations (`t - 1`).
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values provided by the user for the last iteration.
- The variable `sum_f` will contain the sum of all `f` values input during the last iteration.
- The variable `j` will be `m - 1`, indicating the last iteration of the inner loop.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the last set of input integers from the last iteration of the inner loop.
- The variable `cn2` will be calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- The variable `p` will be the result of the expression `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1))` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- The variable `q` will be the result of the expression `2 * cn2 ** 2` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- The variable `gcd` will be the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
