Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sum_f`**: After the loop completes, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values input during the loop.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be `m - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m - 1`.
- **`a`, `b`, and `f`**: These will be the last set of input integers read during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`cn2`**: Remains `n * (n - 1) // 2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: After the loop, `p` will be calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- **`q`**: After the loop, `q` will be calculated as `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`.
- **`gcd`**: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` will be calculated based on the final values of `p` and `q`.
