The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to its current value. Let's analyze the impact:

- Initially, `sum_f` is defined as `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`.
- After executing `sum_f += f`, `sum_f` becomes `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `3 * f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
