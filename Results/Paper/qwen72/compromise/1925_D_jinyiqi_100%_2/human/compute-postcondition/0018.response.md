Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `m` is the number of iterations completed, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
