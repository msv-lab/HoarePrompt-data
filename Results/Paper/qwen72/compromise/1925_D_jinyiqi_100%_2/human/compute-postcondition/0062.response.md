To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`**:
   \[
   \text{cn2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]
   This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items.

2. **Calculate `p`**:
   \[
   \text{p} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}}
   \]
   Here, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

3. **Calculate `q`**:
   \[
   \text{q} = \frac{2 \times \text{cn2}}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`**:
   \[
   \text{modular\_inverse\_of\_q} = \text{pow}(q, -1, M)
   \]
   This computes the modular inverse of `q` under modulo `M`.

5. **Compute the final result**:
   \[
   \text{result} = (\text{p} \times \text{modular\_inverse\_of\_q}) \% M
   \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the above computation, which is the value of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

Given the complexity and the dependencies on the input values, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f`. However, the output will be the result of the modular arithmetic operation described.

Output: **(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is 2 * cn2 // gcd, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and M is the modulus used in the modular inverse calculation)**
