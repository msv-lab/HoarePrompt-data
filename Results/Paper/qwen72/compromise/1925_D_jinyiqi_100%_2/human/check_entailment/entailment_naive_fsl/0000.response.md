Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the formula used in the program to calculate `p` and `q` is incorrect. The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:

```python
p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
```

However, the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where:
- \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the i-th pair.
- \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of n, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

The expected value for each pair is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions. The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \( \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) because each pair has a probability of \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) of being chosen in each excursion, and this happens k times.

The program's formula does not correctly reflect this expected value calculation, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

The correct output should be 3, but the program will produce a different result due to the incorrect formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
