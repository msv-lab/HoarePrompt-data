You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p = p // gcd
        q = q // gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the number of queries (`k`). For each test case, it reads a list of edges, where each edge is represented by two nodes (`a_i`, `b_i`) and a value (`f_i`). It calculates a result based on these inputs and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case, and the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are updated accordingly for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It then reads the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The sum of initial friendship values of all pairs is calculated and stored in `sum_f`.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be derived from the probability of choosing a pair and the number of excursions.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values after \(k\) excursions is given by:
     \[
     E = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{n(n-1)} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying the second term:
     \[
     \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2}
     \]

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the numerator and denominator of the expected value.
   - It uses the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction.
   - Finally, it computes the modular inverse of the denominator and multiplies it by the numerator to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (i.e., \(m = 0\)) correctly, as the expected value is 0.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem. The mathematical formulation and the implementation match the problem requirements.
