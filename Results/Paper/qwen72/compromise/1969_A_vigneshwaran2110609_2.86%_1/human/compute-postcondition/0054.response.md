Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` must be greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` remains unchanged, the program prints 3. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
