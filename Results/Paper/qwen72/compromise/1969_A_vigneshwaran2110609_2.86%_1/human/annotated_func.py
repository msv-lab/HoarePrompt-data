#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should return the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x-1` for any of the `n` test cases. If the condition was never met for any test case, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program prints 3 for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from user input. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found for any test case, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `x`, and `l` as they were last set, and a `flag` variable that is True if the condition was met for any test case, or remains undefined if the condition was never met.
