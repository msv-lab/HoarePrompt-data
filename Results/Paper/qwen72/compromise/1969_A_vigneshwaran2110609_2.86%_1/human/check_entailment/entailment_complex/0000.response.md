Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Invitations**:
   - The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checking if the best friend of the best friend of the i-th friend is the i-th friend itself. This is not the correct condition to determine if the i-th friend and their best friend both have invitations.
   - The correct condition should be to find pairs of friends where both friends in the pair can be invited to ensure they both attend.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations.
   - The program prints `2` if it finds any friend whose best friend's best friend is themselves, which is not the correct logic for the problem.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints `3` for all test cases, which is not necessarily the correct minimum number of invitations.

3. **Missing Logic for Finding Minimum Invitations**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
   - It should identify pairs of friends who are best friends with each other and ensure that at least one friend from each pair is invited.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
