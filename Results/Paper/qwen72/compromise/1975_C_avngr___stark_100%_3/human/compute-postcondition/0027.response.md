The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `_`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and is incremented by the loop, it does not need to be explicitly stated. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]`**
