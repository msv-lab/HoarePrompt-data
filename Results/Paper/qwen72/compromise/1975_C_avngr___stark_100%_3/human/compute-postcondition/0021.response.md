Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements from index 1 to index 3 of `a` if `a` has at least 4 elements, otherwise `temp` is a sorted list containing the first 5 elements of `a`. `max` remains 0 unless `temp[1] > max`, in which case `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.**
