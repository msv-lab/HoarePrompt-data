The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `i` (which will be 1) is less than `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if `temp[1]` is greater than the initial `max`, otherwise `max` remains 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` if `a` has at least three elements, otherwise `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements from `a` starting at index 0 up to the end of the list.**
