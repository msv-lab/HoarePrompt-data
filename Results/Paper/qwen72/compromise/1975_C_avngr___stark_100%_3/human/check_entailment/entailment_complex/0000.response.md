### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is not ideal based on the problem description. However, it reads inputs directly from `input()` within the function, which is a common practice in competitive programming. This is not incorrect, but it is worth noting that the function signature could be more descriptive if it took parameters like `t`, `n`, and `a`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case using a for loop.

3. **Base Case for `n == 2`:**
   - For the base case where `n == 2`, the function prints the minimum value of the array `a`. This is correct because the only possible operation is to choose the entire array, and the median of a two-element array is the minimum of the two elements.

4. **Finding the Maximum Median for Subarrays of Length 3:**
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3 and finds the median of each subarray. The median is the middle element of the sorted subarray, which is correctly identified by sorting the subarray and taking the second element (`temp[1]`).
   - The function then updates the `max` variable with the maximum median found.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum median value found for each test case, which is the correct output based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the base case, iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3, and finds the maximum median value. The output is also correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
