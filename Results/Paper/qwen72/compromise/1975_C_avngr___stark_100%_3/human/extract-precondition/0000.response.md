Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of positive integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as input parameters. Additionally, it should handle multiple test cases, so the number of test cases `t` should also be an input parameter. Therefore, the correct function signature should be `def func(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case.**
