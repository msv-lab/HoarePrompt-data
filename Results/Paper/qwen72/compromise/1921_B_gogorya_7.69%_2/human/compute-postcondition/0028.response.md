Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1, and `res` is increased by 1.***
