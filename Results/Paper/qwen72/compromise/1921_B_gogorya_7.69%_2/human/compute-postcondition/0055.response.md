Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` or `a1 - a2 - 2` depending on the initial value of `hd`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
