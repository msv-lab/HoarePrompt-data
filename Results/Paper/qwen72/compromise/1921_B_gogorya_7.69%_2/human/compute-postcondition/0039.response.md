The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and should start at 0 for the loop to execute properly.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`**
