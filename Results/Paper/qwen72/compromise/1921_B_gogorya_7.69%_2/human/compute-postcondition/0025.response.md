Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `hd` is decreased by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
