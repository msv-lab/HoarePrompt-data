Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `hd` is greater than or equal to 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
