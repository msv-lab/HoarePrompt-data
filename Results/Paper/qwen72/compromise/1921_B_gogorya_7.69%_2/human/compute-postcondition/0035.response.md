Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is the initial value of `a1 - a2` minus the number of times `hd` was greater than 0 during the loop, and `res` is the absolute value of the initial `a1 - a2` plus the number of times `s1[i]` was '1' and `s2[i]` was '0' for each `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `hd` was not greater than 0.**
