Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are '1' and '0' respectively; otherwise, `res` remains the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.***
