### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` of positive integers.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones`: This array keeps a cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `c` up to each index.
   - `sum`: This array keeps a cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `c` and 1. Specifically, `sum[i]` is the sum of `(c[j] - 1)` for all `j` from 1 to `i`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, defined by indices `l` and `r`, the function calculates:
     - `onesInRange`: The number of 1s in the subarray `c[l-1:r]`.
     - `sumInRange`: The sum of the differences `(c[j] - 1)` for all `j` in the subarray `c[l-1:r]`.
   - The condition checked is:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]

4. **Condition Explanation:**
   - `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - `r - l + 1` is the length of the subarray.
   - `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences `(c[j] - 1)` for all `j` in the subarray.
   - The condition checks if the sum of the differences plus the number of 1s is at least the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to change all 1s to some other positive integer without changing the sum of the subarray.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the subarray has all elements equal to 1. Specifically, it claims that the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for such subarrays.

#### Evaluation:
- **Subarray with All Elements Equal to 1:**
  - If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, then:
    - `onesInRange` will be equal to the length of the subarray, `r - l + 1`.
    - `sumInRange` will be 0 because each element in the subarray is 1, and `c[j] - 1` is 0 for all `j`.
  - The condition becomes:
    \[
    \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}
    \]
    \[
    (r - l + 1) + (r - l + 1) \leq 0
    \]
    \[
    2 \times (r - l + 1) \leq 0
    \]
  - This condition is always false, so the program should output "NO" for subarrays with all elements equal to 1.

- **Example Input:**
  - For the input:
    ```
    1
    5 2
    1 1 1 1 1
    1 5
    2 4
    ```
  - The subarray `c[1:5]` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
    - `onesInRange` = 5
    - `sumInRange` = 0
    - Condition: \( 2 \times 5 \leq 0 \) (False), so the output should be "NO".
  - The subarray `c[2:4]` is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`:
    - `onesInRange` = 4
    - `sumInRange` = 0
    - Condition: \( 2 \times 4 \leq 0 \) (False), so the output should be "NO".

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs "NO" for both queries, as the condition is false for subarrays with all elements equal to 1.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has all elements equal to 1 and outputs "NO" for such subarrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
