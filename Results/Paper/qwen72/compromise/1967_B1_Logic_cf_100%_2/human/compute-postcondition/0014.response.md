The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their original integer values to new string values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings read from input, `min(n, m) >= 2` (where `n` and `m` are now strings), `t` must be greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to the original value of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` (where `n` and `m` are the original integer values).**
