Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain integers, and the condition `min(n, m) >= 2` ensures that the loop runs at least once.
- **`t`**: This remains greater than 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: This remains 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: Initially set to `n`, `ans` is updated in each iteration of the loop. The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the results of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1`, which is the value just after the last iteration of the loop.
