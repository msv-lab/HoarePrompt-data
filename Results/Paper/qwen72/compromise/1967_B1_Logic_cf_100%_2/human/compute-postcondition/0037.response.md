Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is the input integer, `T` is `t - 1`, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, and `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are integers that were read from the input during each iteration of the outer loop. They are updated in each iteration based on the input provided.
- **`min(n, m) >= 2`**: This condition ensures that the inner loop runs at least once, as it starts from `b = 2` and goes up to `min(n, m)`.
- **`t`**: This is the total number of iterations the outer loop will run, as specified by the input.
- **`T`**: This is the loop counter for the outer loop, which will be `t - 1` after the last iteration.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the final result of the computation for each pair `(n, m)`. It is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.
- **`b`**: This is the loop counter for the inner loop, which will be `min(n, m) + 1` after the inner loop completes its execution.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
