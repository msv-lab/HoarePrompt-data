### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Initial Count:**
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to \(n\). This is correct because for \(b = 1\), any \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) will satisfy the condition since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

4. **Loop for \(b > 1\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

5. **Analysis of the Condition:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly handled in the program.
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(b\).

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a given \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This requires checking the divisibility condition for each \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\).

### Detailed Analysis of the Given Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ans = n` is correct for \(b = 1\).

- **Loop for \(b > 1\):**
  - The loop iterates from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
  - The update `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over each \(b\) and for each \(b\), count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using the following approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
