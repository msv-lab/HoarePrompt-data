The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, and `j` starts from 97 and goes up to `k + 96`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1, which is already given in the state. The variable `j` is automatically set by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted manually.

However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is at least 1 and that `j` starts from 97. The initial state already specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to 26, so `k` is already valid. The variable `i` and the string `s` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes at least once by confirming that `k` is at least 1 and `j` starts from 97.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty string, `j` starts from 97**
