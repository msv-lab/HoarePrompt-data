Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 'ab' + 'c', `j` is 99, `k` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 99, `chr(99)` is the character 'c'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'ab' to 'abc'. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
