Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 'ab', `j` is 98, `k` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j`, which is 98. The character with ASCII value 98 is 'b'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'a' to 'ab'. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
