The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. The ASCII value 99 corresponds to the character 'c'. Therefore, the string `s` changes from 'ab' to 'abc'. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 'abc', `j` is 99, `k` must be at least 2**
