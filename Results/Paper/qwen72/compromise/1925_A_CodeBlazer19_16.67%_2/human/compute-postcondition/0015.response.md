Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `k` is 1, `s` is the string 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` is the string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k` + 96, with `k` not equal to 1.***
