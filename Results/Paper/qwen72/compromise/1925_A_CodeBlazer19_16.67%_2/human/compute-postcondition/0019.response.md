The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. For the loop to execute, `k + 97` must be greater than `97`. Given that `k` is a positive integer and 1 <= `k` <= 26, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `j` should be set to 97, and `k` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97, `k` must be at least 1**
