You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed, `i` is `t` - 1, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96. If `k` is 1, `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` which represent the length of the strings to be formed and the number of alphabets to use, respectively.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done using a loop that iterates from `97` to `97 + k` and converts each integer to its corresponding character using `chr(j)`.
   - For example, if `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `"abc"`.

3. **Output for `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` is `1`, the program prints a string of length `n` consisting of the single character `s`. This is correct because there is only one possible string of length `n` using a single character, and it is `s * n`.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output will be `"aa"`.

4. **Output for `k > 1`:**
   - If `k` is greater than `1`, the program prints a string that is `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`.
   - The expression `(2 - (n == 1))` evaluates to `1` if `n` is `1` and `2` if `n` is greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, if `n == 1`, the program prints `s` once, which is correct because the only possible string of length `1` using `k` alphabets is any single character from `s`.
   - If `n > 1`, the program prints `s` twice. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the output string.

5. **Subsequence Check:**
   - For `n > 1` and `k > 1`, the program needs to generate a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - Printing `s` twice does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `"abcabc"` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `2` using `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect for the case where `n > 1` and `k > 1` because it does not generate a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
