You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and the first `i` elements of `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is no longer accessible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.

3. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - The program iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a` for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:** `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` for all `1 \le i \le n`.
  - Since `a[0]` is set to 500 and each subsequent `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`, and given that `1 \le x_i \le 500`, the values of `a[i]` will always be within the range `[500, 10^9]`.

- **Condition 2:** `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
  - By setting `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, the remainder when `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]` is exactly `x[i-1]`. This is because `a[i]` is constructed to be `a[i-1]` plus the exact value of `x[i-1]`.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502`
  - `a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506`
  - `a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507`
  - Output: `500 502 506 507`
  - Verification:
    - `502 \bmod 500 = 2`
    - `506 \bmod 502 = 4`
    - `507 \bmod 506 = 1`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 3`, `x = [1, 1]`
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = 500 + 1 = 501`
  - `a[2] = 501 + 1 = 502`
  - Output: `500 501 502`
  - Verification:
    - `501 \bmod 500 = 1`
    - `502 \bmod 501 = 1`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 6`, `x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]`
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = 500 + 4 = 504`
  - `a[2] = 504 + 2 = 506`
  - `a[3] = 506 + 5 = 511`
  - `a[4] = 511 + 1 = 512`
  - `a[5] = 512 + 2 = 514`
  - Output: `500 504 506 511 512 514`
  - Verification:
    - `504 \bmod 500 = 4`
    - `506 \bmod 504 = 2`
    - `511 \bmod 506 = 5`
    - `512 \bmod 511 = 1`
    - `514 \bmod 512 = 2`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 2`, `x = [500]`
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = 500 + 500 = 1000`
  - Output: `500 1000`
  - Verification:
    - `1000 \bmod 500 = 0` (This is incorrect, but the problem allows any valid solution, and the provided solution is valid.)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 3`, `x = [1, 5]`
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = 500 + 1 = 501`
  - `a[2] = 501 + 5 = 506`
  - Output: `500 501 506`
  - Verification:
    - `501 \bmod 500 = 1`
    - `506 \bmod 501 = 5`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies both conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
