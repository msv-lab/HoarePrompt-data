**Reasoning:**

1. **Initialization of `a[0]` to 500:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice since \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

2. **Construction of `a` array:**
   - For each subsequent element \(a[i]\) (where \(1 \le i < n\)), the program sets \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
   - This ensures that \(a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]\) because \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) implies \(a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]\).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) by starting with \(a[0] = 500\) and incrementing each subsequent \(a[i]\) by \(x[i-1]\), which is at most 500. This means \(a[i]\) will always be within the valid range.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case, which satisfies the given conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum value of \(n = 2\) correctly. For \(n = 2\), it will read a single value for \(x_2\) and construct \(a = [500, 500 + x_2]\), which is valid.
   - The program also handles the maximum value of \(n = 500\) and the maximum value of \(x_i = 500\) correctly, ensuring that the final value of \(a[n-1]\) does not exceed \(10^9\).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
