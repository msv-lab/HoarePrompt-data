Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the first element of the array `x` is 500. According to the problem description, `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`, and the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. If `x[0]` is 500, then `a[1]` will be `500 + 500 = 1000`, and `a[1] % a[0]` will be `1000 % 500 = 0`, which does not match `x[1] = 500`. Therefore, the program fails for this specific input case.
