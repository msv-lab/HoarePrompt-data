You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two equal halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of duplicate elements from the first half and single elements from the first half until it has printed `k` elements. It then repeats the process for the second half, printing pairs of duplicate elements and single elements until it has printed `k` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the sorted sublists and the lists of duplicate and single elements from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting**:
   - The program splits the list `lst` into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good approach because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements easily.

4. **Finding Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted `lft` array to find duplicates and singles.
   - Duplicates are added to the list `ldb` (left duplicates).
   - Singles are added to the list `sng` (singles).
   - Similarly, duplicates in the `rgt` array are added to the list `rdb` (right duplicates).

5. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`**:
   - The program constructs the array `l` by first adding pairs of duplicates from `ldb` until the size of `l` reaches `2k`.
   - If more elements are needed, it adds singles from `sng`.
   - The same process is repeated for the array `r` using `rdb` and `sng`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Duplicates and XOR**:
  - The XOR of a pair of identical elements is zero. Therefore, adding pairs of duplicates to both `l` and `r` ensures that the XOR of these pairs is zero, which helps in balancing the XOR of the entire arrays.
  - If there are not enough pairs of duplicates, the program uses singles. However, the problem guarantees that at least one valid solution exists, so this should not be an issue.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 by ensuring that it can always find a valid pair or single element to satisfy the XOR condition.
  - The program also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by ensuring that it can find enough pairs or singles to construct arrays of length `2k`.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly identifies and uses pairs of duplicates and singles to construct the arrays `l` and `r`.
  - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and logic. It constructs the arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements is equal, and it handles the edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
