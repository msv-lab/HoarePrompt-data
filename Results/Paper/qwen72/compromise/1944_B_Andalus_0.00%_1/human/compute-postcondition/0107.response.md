To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty list.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `rdb` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`).
   - `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `lft` and `rgt` are sorted lists derived from `lst`.
   - `ldb` and `rdb` are lists of elements that are equal to their preceding elements in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
   - `sz` is determined based on the conditions provided, and it is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements processed from `rdb`.
   - `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`, which is the last element in `rdb` that was processed.
   - Since the exact values of `lst`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed based on the conditions given.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the last element in `rdb` that was processed.

Output: **elem (where elem is the last element in rdb that was processed)**
