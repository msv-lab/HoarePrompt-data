The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on whether there are more elements in `sng` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the next element in `sng`, and `sng` is a non-empty iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, `sng` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
