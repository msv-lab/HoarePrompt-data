Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least two elements, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0. The program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
