Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `ldb` must contain at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` is less than `k`, `sz` is set to 2 and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `ldb`.
   - Since `ldb` must contain at least two elements, `elem` will always be a valid element from `ldb`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` repeated twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in the list ldb)**
