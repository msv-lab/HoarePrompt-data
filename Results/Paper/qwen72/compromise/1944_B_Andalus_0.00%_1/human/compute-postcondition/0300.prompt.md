Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to 2 and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was initially less than `k`, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was initially less than `k`, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sz` remains 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
