Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 1, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the second element of `lft`, and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 2, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[2]` appended to it, and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[2]`, and `elem` is `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 3, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]` appended to it, and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[3]`, and `elem` is `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
