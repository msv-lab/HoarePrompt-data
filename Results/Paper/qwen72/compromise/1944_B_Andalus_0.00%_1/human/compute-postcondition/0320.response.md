The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` is not empty, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must have at least one element.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least one element, `sz` is 0, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.**
