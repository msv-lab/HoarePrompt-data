Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least `k // 2` elements. `sz` is `k` or the number of elements printed is the maximum possible without exceeding `k`. The program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` must have at least one element. If the size of `sng` (sz) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement. `sz` is now `sz + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` must have at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
