Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the third element of `lft`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `rdb` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the third element of `lft` and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`, and `ldb` remains an empty list. Otherwise, both `ldb` and `sng` remain empty lists. `rdb` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
