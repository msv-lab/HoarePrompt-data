Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `T` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
6. `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
8. `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, plus 2.
9. The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to -2.
10. `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
11. `sng` must have at least three elements.
12. `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
13. `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
14. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
- According to the initial state, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`.
- `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements.

Since the exact values of `sng` are not provided, we can only describe `elem` as the third element of `sng`.

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
