Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `T` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `n` and `k` are input integers.
4. `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
6. `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
7. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
8. `i` is `n-1`.
9. `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
10. `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
11. `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
12. `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1.
13. `sng` must have at least 2 elements.
14. `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
15. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`lst`**: This is a list of integers input by the user.
2. **`lft`**: This is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
3. **`sng`**: This is a list containing elements from `lft` that are unique (not equal to their preceding or succeeding elements). The precondition states that `sng` must have at least 2 elements.
4. **`elem`**: This is the second element in the `sng` list.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `sng` is a list of unique elements from `lft` and it must have at least 2 elements, `elem` will be the second element in this list.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the sng list, and sng is a list of unique elements from the sorted list lft)**
