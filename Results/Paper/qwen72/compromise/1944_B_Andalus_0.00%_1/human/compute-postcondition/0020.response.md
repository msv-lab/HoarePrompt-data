Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` was an empty list and now contains the third element of `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2.**
