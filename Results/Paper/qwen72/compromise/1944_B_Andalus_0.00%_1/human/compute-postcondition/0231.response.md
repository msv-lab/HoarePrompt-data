Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`T` is greater than 0**: This is a condition that is true.
2. **`_` is 1**: This is a variable with a known explicit value.
3. **`n` is greater than or equal to 1**: This is a condition that is true.
4. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the first `n` elements of `lst`.
5. **`lst` is a list of integers input by the user**: This is a list of integers, but the exact values are not provided.
6. **`lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`**: This is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **`rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end**: This is a sorted list of the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **`sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k` and is now `sz + 1`**: This means `sz` has been incremented by 1 after some processing.
9. **The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed**: This is a condition that helps determine the state of `sz` and `k`.
10. **`ldb` must be a non-empty list**: This is a condition that is true.
11. **`sng` must have at least 2 elements**: This is a condition that is true.
12. **`rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed**: This is a condition that is true.
13. **`elem` is the second element in `sng`**: This is a variable with a known value based on the second element of `sng`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `sng`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, the `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list `sng`)**
