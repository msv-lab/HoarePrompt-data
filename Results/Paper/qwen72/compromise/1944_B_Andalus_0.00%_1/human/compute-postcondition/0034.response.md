To determine the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element
- `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`
- `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` remains an empty list

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop increment.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` remains an empty list.**
