Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, plus 1.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to -1.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `sng`.
   - The list `sng` is required to have at least two elements.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the second element in `sng`, the print statement will output this value followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng)**
