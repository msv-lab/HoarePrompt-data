Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is `n-1`, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` now contains `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` now contains `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` now contains `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
