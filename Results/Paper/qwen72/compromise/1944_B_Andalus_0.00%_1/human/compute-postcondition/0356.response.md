Output State: **`sng` must have at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same. The other variables and conditions are not affected by this code snippet.
