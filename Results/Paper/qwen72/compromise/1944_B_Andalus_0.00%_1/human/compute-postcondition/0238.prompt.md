Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k` and is now `sz + 1`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least 1 element, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is now `sz + 1`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is now `sz + 2`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
