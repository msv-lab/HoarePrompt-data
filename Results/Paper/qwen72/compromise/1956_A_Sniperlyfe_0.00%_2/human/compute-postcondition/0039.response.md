The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250
- `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again
- `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`
- `n` is the first element of `qs`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `qs` must have at least 2 elements (since the first element has already been used).
- The variable `n` will now be the second element of `qs`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element of `qs`**
