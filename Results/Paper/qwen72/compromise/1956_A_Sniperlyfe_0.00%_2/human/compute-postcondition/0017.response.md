Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they appear in `qs`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**
