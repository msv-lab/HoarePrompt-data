The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250.
- `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100.
- `p` is a list of `k` positive integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.

The function returns a list of results based on the input parameters. Each element in the list corresponds to a value in `qs`, and the result for each value in `qs` is determined by the positions of the elements in `p`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a value in `qs` and is determined by the positions of the elements in the strictly increasing list `p`.**
