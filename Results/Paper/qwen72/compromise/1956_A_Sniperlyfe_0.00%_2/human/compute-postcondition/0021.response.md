The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `n` will take the value of the first element in `qs` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have at least 1 element, `res` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `n` is the first element in `qs`**
