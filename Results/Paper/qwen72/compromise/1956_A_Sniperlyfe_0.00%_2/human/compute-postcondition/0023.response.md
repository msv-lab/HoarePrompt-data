Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\) and must have at least 1 element.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is converting each element of the list `res` to a string and then joining them with a space.
   - `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in the list `qs` and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - Since the exact values of `p` and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the result of `func_1`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The exact values of the elements in `res` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n` and `p`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the result of func_1(n, p) and n is the first element in the list qs)**
