Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3 < n`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l` based on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`. If neither of these conditions holds, `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.***
