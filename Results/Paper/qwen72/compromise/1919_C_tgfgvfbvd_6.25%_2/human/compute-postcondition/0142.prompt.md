Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element if such an element exists, otherwise `b` is 0, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element (or 0 if none exists). Otherwise, `a` remains the first element in `l`, and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In all cases, the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `l[x]` are maintained according to the conditions evaluated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, and `y + 2 < n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then: if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then: if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on the condition: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then: if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3 < n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l` based on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`. If neither of these conditions holds, `b` is updated to the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
