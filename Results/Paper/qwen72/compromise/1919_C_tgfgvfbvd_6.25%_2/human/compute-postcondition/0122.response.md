The value of `b` is updated to the value of the element in the list `l` at index `x`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, and `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is within the bounds of the list `l`. Therefore, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is 0 or 1, `b` is `l[y + 2]`.**
