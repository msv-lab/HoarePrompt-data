Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0.** 

The variable `c` is initialized to 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
