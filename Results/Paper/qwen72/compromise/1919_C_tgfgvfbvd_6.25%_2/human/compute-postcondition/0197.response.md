Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the value of the element `l[x]`, `x` is `y + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l` to the variable `b`.
- The value of `x` is `y + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is specifically the value of the element `l[x]`.
