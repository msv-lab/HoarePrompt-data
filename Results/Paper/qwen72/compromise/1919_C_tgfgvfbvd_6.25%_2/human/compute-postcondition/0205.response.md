Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` in `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. `c` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between these variables also remain valid.
