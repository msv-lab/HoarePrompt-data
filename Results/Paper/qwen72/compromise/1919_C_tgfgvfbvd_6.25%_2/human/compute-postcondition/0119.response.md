Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is 0 or 1, and `y + 2 < n`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[y + 2]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[y + 2]`.***
