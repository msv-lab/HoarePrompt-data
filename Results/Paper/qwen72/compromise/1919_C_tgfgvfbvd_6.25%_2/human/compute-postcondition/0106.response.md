Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is now `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and the previous value of `b`. Additionally, `(a - l[x]) > (b - l[x])`.**
