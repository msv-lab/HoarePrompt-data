Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that is less than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, `b` is the last element in `l` that is greater than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, and `c` is the total count of elements in `l` from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` when they were initially set, summed over all iterations of the outer loop.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `n` is the input integer for each iteration, and `l` is the list of integers read from the input for each iteration. The variable `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists. The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the inner loop, and `c` is the total count of elements in `l` that meet the specified conditions across all iterations of the outer loop.
