Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is now `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the previous value of `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
