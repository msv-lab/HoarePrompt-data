To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists.
   - `a` is the last element in `l` that is less than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`.
   - `b` is the last element in `l` that is greater than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` when they were initially set.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Finding `y`:**
     - Iterate through the list `l` to find the first index `y` where `l[y] > l[y-1]`.
     - If no such element exists, set `y` to `n-1`.

   - **Finding `a` and `b`:**
     - Initialize `a` and `b` to the last element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]`.
     - Iterate backward through the sublist `l[y+1:n]` to find the last element that is less than or equal to all elements in the sublist for `a`.
     - Similarly, iterate backward to find the last element that is greater than or equal to all elements in the sublist for `b`.

   - **Counting `c`:**
     - Initialize `c` to 0.
     - Iterate through the sublist `l[y+1:n]` and count the number of elements that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The value of `c` will be the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given the complexity and the conditions, the exact numerical value of `c` cannot be determined without the specific values of `l` and `n`. However, based on the logic described, the `print(c)` statement will output the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
