To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists.
- `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`.
- `x` is `y + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.
- The variable `x` is the loop iterator, and it starts at `y + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `x`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is `y + 2`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `x` should be `y + 3`.

### Final State:
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` in `l` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element or 0 if no such element exists, and the value of `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists. If neither of these conditions is met, `a` remains the first element in `l` and `b` is the value of the element `l[x]`.**
