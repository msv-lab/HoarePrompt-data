The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was `y + 2` and it is given that `y + 2 < n`. For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, making it `y + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y + 3` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3 < n`.**
