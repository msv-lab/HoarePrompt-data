Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 1`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[y + k + 1]`.***
