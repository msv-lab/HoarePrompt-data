Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is 0 or 1, `a` is `l[y + 2]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to the element in the list `l` at the index `x`, which is `y + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
