The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
