Output State: **`t` is 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b` (which is 0, since `b` is a list of 26 zeros and `i` must be one of those zeros).**
