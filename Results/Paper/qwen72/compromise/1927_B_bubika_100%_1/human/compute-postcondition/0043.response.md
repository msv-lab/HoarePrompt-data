The code snippet `r = ''` reassigns the variable `r` to an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is an empty string.**
