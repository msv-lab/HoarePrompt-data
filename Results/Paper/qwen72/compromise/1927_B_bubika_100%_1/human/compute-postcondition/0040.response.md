Output State: **`t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices corresponding to the values in `s`, concatenated in the order of the elements in `s`.** 

The list `b` is now initialized to a list of 26 zeros, while the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `r` remain unchanged.
