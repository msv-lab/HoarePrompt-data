Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if any integer in the list `l` appears at least `k` times. If so, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not modified. The function does not return any value, but it produces a series of integer outputs, one for each test case. **
