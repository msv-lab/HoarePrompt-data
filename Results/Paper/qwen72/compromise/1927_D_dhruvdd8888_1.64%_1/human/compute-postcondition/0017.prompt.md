You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take a list of integers `a` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The list of queries contains `q` queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end, `N` is an input integer, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of the same integer in `nums`, along with the integer itself.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [input_list, -1] (where input_list is the list of integers provided by the user, and `-1` is appended at the end)
    #State: *`nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end, `N` is an input integer, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of the same integer in `nums`, along with the integer itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, the program retains these conditions.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, and `num` will have their values changed within the loop, but their final values will depend on the input and the specific iterations. The variables `nums`, `N`, `arr`, `LA`, and `ppp` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the operation performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]` for each query. If the function is called multiple times, it processes each test case independently.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
