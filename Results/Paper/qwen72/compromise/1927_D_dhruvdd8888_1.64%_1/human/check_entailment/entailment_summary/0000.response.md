Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case using a loop. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`. This part of the program is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Segment Identification**: The program identifies contiguous segments of the same integer in `nums` and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)`. This is done by iterating through `nums` and appending a new segment to `arr` whenever a different integer is encountered. The additional `-1` appended to `nums` ensures that the last segment is always added to `arr`.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` of the first segment in `arr` that starts at or after `l`. It then checks if the segment boundaries fall within the query range `(l, r)`:
   - If the segment starts after `l` and before `r`, it prints the indices of the segment boundary.
   - If the segment starts at `l` and ends before `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` because no valid pair exists within the range.
   - If the segment ends at or after `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` because no valid pair exists within the range.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it prints the indices of the segment boundary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array `nums` consists of a single unique integer repeated multiple times.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array `nums` has different integers, and the query range is small enough to only include one segment.

5. **Special Conditions**:
   - The condition `if ppp == 23:` is used for debugging and does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.
   - The condition `if tc > 5:` is also used for debugging and skips processing for test cases beyond the first 5. This could be problematic if the program is intended to handle all test cases, but since it is not part of the standard input/output flow, it does not affect the correctness of the program for the provided test cases.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, either a pair of indices or `(-1, -1)` if no valid pair exists.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Global Variables**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop, but it uses global variables like `ppp` and `tc`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if these variables are modified elsewhere in the program. It is better to pass these variables as arguments to the function.

- **Query Range Check**: The logic for checking if a valid pair exists within the query range is not entirely correct. Specifically, the conditions for printing `(-1, -1)` and the indices of the segment boundaries need to be more robust.

- **Segment Boundary Handling**: The program should handle the case where the segment boundaries are exactly at `l` and `r` more carefully. For example, if the segment starts at `l` and ends at `r`, and there are no other segments within the range, the program should still check if there are any other valid pairs.

Given these issues, the program is not entirely correct. The logic for handling segment boundaries and query ranges needs to be refined to ensure it always finds a valid pair or correctly reports that no such pair exists.

Correctness: **False**
