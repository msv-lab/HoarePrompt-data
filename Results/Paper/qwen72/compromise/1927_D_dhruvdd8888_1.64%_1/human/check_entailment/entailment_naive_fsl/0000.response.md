Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly. The program defines `func_1` but calls it inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, which is incorrect because `func_1` is not defined to take any arguments.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The `input` function is redefined inside `func_1`, which can cause issues if the program is run in an environment where `input` is not available or is used elsewhere.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program uses a binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a number in the array, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains multiple different numbers within the query range.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the query range contains only one unique number. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the current logic does not handle this case correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the query range is very small (e.g., `(1, 2)` in an array with two identical elements) or where the query range is the entire array.

5. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not always output the correct indices for the elements. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output any pair of different elements, but the current logic may not always provide a valid pair.

To demonstrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output is:
```
-1 -1
```

However, the program will not correctly handle this case and may output incorrect indices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
