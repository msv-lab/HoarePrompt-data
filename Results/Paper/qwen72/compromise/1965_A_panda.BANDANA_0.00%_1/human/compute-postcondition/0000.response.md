Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
