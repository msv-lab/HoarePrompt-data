Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in a few key areas:

1. **Condition Checking for Parity**:
   - The program checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` to determine if `b` and `c` can have the same parity. However, this is incorrect. The parity check should be between `b` and `c`, not `a` and `b`. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not a value related to the moves or the final tower height.

2. **Output Case Sensitivity**:
   - The program outputs 'YES' and 'No' in different cases. According to the problem description, the output should be case-insensitive, but for consistency, it's better to stick to one case (e.g., 'Yes' and 'No').

3. **Logic for Moves**:
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `b` equals `c` and where `b` is less than `c`. However, the condition for checking if `b` and `c` have the same parity should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

4. **Unnecessary Tuple**:
   - The tuple `q` is created but not used, which is unnecessary.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

Correctness: **False**
