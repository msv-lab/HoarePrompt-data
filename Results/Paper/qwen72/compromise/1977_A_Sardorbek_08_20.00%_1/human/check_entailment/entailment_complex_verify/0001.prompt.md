You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `a` times. The final values of `b` and `c` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and the tuple `q` contains these final values. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `a` from the input, and for each of the `a` iterations, it reads a pair of integers `b` and `c`. For each pair, it prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'No'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the loop has executed `a` times, and the last values of `b` and `c` are stored in the tuple `q`. The function does not modify or use any external parameters `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `a` times, where it reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if b == c`
     - This checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. If they are equal, it means Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower `b` times to achieve exactly `c` cubes.
     - **Correct**: This condition is valid and should print "YES".

   - **Condition 2**: `elif b < c`
     - This checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita can only perform `b` moves.
     - **Correct**: This condition is valid and should print "NO".

   - **Condition 3**: `elif a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`.
     - **Incorrect**: The parity of `a` (number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes. For example, if `b` is 5 and `c` is 3, the difference is 2, which is even, and it is possible to achieve this by putting 4 cubes and removing 1 cube.

   - **Condition 4**: `else`
     - This is the default case where none of the above conditions are met.
     - **Incorrect**: Since the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is not correctly checked, this else block will not always produce the correct output.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions. However, the conditions are not correctly formulated, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains a logical error in the condition checking the parity of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`. This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the problem.
