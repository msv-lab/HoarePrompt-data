Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through both strings `a` and `b` to find the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, the indices `i` and `j` are updated, and the count `c` is incremented. If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current count `c` is printed, which represents the maximum `k`.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and meets the problem's requirements, including the constraints on the lengths of the strings and the number of test cases.
