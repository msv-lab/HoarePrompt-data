Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string.**

The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged. The input is split into two parts, and these parts are assigned to `list_len` and `max_power` as strings.
