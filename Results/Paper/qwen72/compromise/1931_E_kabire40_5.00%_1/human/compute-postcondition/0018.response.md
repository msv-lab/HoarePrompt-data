Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string. `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, which is the third element in `operational_list`.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `operational_list`, `x`, `rev_res`, `rev_val`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `rev_res` and `rev_val` is not evaluated in this snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
