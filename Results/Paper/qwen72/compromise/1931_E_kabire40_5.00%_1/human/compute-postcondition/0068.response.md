Output State: **`y` is 1, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 3 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` remains an empty string, `rev_val` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
- The length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not checked in this code snippet, so `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain unchanged.
- The initial state variables `y`, `x`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain the same as they were not affected by this code.
