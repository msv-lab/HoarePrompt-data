Postcondition: **`y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 1 string, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`.**
