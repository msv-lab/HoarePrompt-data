Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least two strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and the reversed string of `x` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, the code appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`, which already contains the reversed string of `x`. Therefore, `rev_val` now contains two instances of the reversed string of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
