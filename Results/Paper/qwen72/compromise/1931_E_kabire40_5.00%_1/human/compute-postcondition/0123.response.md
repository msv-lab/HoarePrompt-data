The code snippet `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. The other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string.**
