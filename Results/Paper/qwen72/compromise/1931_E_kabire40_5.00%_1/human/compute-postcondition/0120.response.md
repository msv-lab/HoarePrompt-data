The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The initial state specifies that `x` is the third string in the `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. The list `rev_val` initially contains the reversed string of `x`. After appending `x[::-1]` to `rev_val`, `rev_val` will contain two elements: the original reversed string of `x` and the newly appended reversed string of `x`.

Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least three strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the third string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and the reversed string of `x` again. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the third string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string.**
