Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together. `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `y` remains unchanged at 2.
- The `operational_list` is the original list of strings from the input.
- `list_len` and `max_power` are the values from the input split by a space, and they remain unchanged.
- `x` is the last string in the `operational_list` after the loop has finished executing.
- `rev_res` contains a concatenation of all the strings in `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string.
- `rev_val` is a list of the reversed strings of all the strings in `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string.
