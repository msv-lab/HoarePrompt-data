Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 1 element, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` includes the string representation of `val_in`, which is the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is followed by the reversed string of the first element of `rev_val`. `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, and `x` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 1 element, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string followed by the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the reversed string of the second element of `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the third element of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
