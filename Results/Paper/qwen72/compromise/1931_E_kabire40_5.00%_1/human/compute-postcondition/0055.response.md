The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `operational_list`. For the loop to execute, `operational_list` must contain at least one string. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `operational_list` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 1 string, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space.**
