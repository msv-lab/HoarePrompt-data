Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least one string, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`.
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
- The other variables (`y`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_res`, `rev_val`) remain unchanged.
