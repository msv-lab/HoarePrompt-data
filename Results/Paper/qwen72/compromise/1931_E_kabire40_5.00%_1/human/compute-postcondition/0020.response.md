The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. 

Given the initial state:
- `y` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements
- `x` is the third element in `operational_list`
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`
- If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x` (the third element in `operational_list`).

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `y` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements
- `x` is the third element in `operational_list`
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`
- If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged

Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string, `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged.**
