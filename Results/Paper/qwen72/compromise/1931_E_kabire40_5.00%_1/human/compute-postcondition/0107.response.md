Postcondition: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least one string, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`.**
