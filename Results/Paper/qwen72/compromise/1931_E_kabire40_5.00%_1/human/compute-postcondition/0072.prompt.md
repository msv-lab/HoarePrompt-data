Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is -1, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 1, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 1 string, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 2 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the string `x` concatenated with the original `rev_res` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 1, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 3 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is set to the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` remains an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
