Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`, `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` concatenates the value of `x` (the third element in `operational_list`) to the existing value of `rev_res`.
- The initial state specifies that if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. This condition is met, so `rev_res` is updated accordingly.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, `list_len`, and `max_power`) remain unchanged.
