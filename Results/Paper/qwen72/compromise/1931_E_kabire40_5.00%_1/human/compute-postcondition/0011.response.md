Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the first element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` is an empty string.***
