You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program iterates over each integer in the list and reverses its digits.
   - It checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer. If so, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` directly.
   - If the length of the reversed integer is different (due to leading zeros being removed), it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then concatenates the elements of `rev_val` to `rev_res` in a specific order: for even indices, it appends the integer as is; for odd indices, it appends the integer in reverse order.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Data Types:**
   - The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are read as strings but should be converted to integers.
   - The list of integers `operational_list` is read as strings and should be converted to integers before processing.

2. **Reversing and Length Check:**
   - The length check `if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):` is incorrect because `x` is a string, and `x_rev` is an integer. The length of `x` should be compared with the length of `str(x_rev)`.

3. **Concatenation Logic:**
   - The logic for concatenating the elements of `rev_val` is flawed. The program should concatenate the elements in a way that maximizes the final number, but the current logic does not ensure this.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. It simply concatenates the reversed values in a specific order, which may not always lead to the correct result.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Reverse the digits of each number
        rev_a = [int(str(x)[::-1]) for x in a]
        
        # Sort the reversed list in descending order to maximize the concatenated result
        rev_a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Concatenate the reversed numbers
        rev_res = ''.join(map(str, rev_a))
        
        # Check if the concatenated result is greater than or equal to 10^m
        if int(rev_res) >= 10 ** m:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `n` and `m` are read as integers.
   - The list `a` is read as integers.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - Each integer in the list `a` is reversed and stored in `rev_a`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The reversed list `rev_a` is sorted in descending order to maximize the concatenated result.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - The sorted reversed integers are concatenated into a single string `rev_res`.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has several issues, including incorrect data type handling, flawed length checks, and suboptimal concatenation logic. The corrected program addresses these issues and ensures that the game is played optimally.
