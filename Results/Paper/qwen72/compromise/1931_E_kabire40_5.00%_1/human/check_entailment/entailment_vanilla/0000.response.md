### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program iterates over each integer in the list and reverses its digits.
   - It checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer. If so, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` directly.
   - If the length of the reversed integer is different (due to leading zeros being removed), it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then concatenates the elements of `rev_val` to `rev_res` in a specific order: for even indices, it appends the integer as is; for odd indices, it appends the integer in reverse order.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Data Types:**
   - The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are read as strings but should be converted to integers.
   - The list of integers `operational_list` is read as strings and should be converted to integers before processing.

2. **Reversing and Length Check:**
   - The length check `if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):` is incorrect because `x` is a string, and `x_rev` is an integer. The length of `x` should be compared with the length of `str(x_rev)`.

3. **Concatenation Logic:**
   - The logic for concatenating the elements of `rev_val` is flawed. The program should concatenate the elements in a way that maximizes the final number, but the current logic does not ensure this.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. It simply concatenates the reversed values in a specific order, which may not always lead to the correct result.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Reverse the digits of each number
        rev_a = [int(str(x)[::-1]) for x in a]
        
        # Sort the reversed list in descending order to maximize the concatenated result
        rev_a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Concatenate the reversed numbers
        rev_res = ''.join(map(str, rev_a))
        
        # Check if the concatenated result is greater than or equal to 10^m
        if int(rev_res) >= 10 ** m:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `n` and `m` are read as integers.
   - The list `a` is read as integers.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - Each integer in the list `a` is reversed and stored in `rev_a`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The reversed list `rev_a` is sorted in descending order to maximize the concatenated result.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - The sorted reversed integers are concatenated into a single string `rev_res`.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has several issues, including incorrect data type handling, flawed length checks, and suboptimal concatenation logic. The corrected program addresses these issues and ensures that the game is played optimally.
