### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b` and initializes the necessary sets and counters.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After this initial check, it determines if the first subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` starting from the second subsegment.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It then checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If it is not, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to efficiently check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
- It maintains the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of the elements and their status in the current subsegment.
- The initial check and the sliding window updates are done in a way that ensures the program correctly counts the number of good subsegments.
