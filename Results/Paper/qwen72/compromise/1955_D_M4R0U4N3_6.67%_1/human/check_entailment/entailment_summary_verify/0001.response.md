### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b` and initializes the necessary sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After this initial check, it determines if the first subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` starting from the second subsegment.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It then checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If it is not, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The initial subsegment check correctly identifies the elements that are in `b` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
  - The condition `len(done) >= k` is used to determine if the first subsegment is good, which is correct.

- **Correctness of Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It efficiently updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides over the array `a`.
  - The program correctly handles the removal of the old element `a[r - m]` and the addition of the new element `a[r]` to the window.
  - The condition `len(done) >= k` is used to determine if the current subsegment is good, which is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k = 1` or `k = m` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\) and \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. The sliding window approach and the use of sets to track the elements ensure that the program efficiently and correctly counts the number of good subsegments.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
