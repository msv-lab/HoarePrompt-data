Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. The conditions are 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. The function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
