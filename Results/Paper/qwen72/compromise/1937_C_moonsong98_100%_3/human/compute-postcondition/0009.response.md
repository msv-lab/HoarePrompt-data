The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the first value in the range specified by `range(0, n)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing `[n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
