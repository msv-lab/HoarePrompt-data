The function `func_2` accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the bounds of a permutation `p` (0 <= a < n and 0 <= b < n, where n is the length of `p`). It prints a formatted string `! [a] [b]` to the standard output and flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the formatted string has been printed, and the output buffer has been flushed.
