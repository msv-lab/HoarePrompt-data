Reasoning:  
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output strings. According to the problem description, the output should be "STAIR" (not "STAIRS") and "PEAK" or "NONE" as specified. The program incorrectly prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the condition `a < b < c` is met. This discrepancy means the program does not fully adhere to the problem's output requirements.

Correctness: **False**
