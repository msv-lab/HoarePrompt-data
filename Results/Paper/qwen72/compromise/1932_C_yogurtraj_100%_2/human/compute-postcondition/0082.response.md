Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `y[i]` is set to `k * a[q2] % m`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `y[i]` is set to the new value of `k`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
