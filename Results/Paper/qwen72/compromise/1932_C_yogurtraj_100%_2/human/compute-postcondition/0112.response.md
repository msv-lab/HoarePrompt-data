The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0` (inclusive), with `i` being decremented by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 3`, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure that `i` remains non-negative and within the range.

State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
