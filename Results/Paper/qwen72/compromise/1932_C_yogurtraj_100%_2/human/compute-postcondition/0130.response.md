Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `t` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. It then processes the list `a` and the string `t` to compute a new list `y` of `n` integers. Each element in `y` is calculated based on the values in `a`, the string `t`, and the modulus `m`. The function prints the list `y` for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `y` has been computed and printed for each test case, and the input variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `t` are no longer needed for further processing. **
