To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i` (the loop variable)
   - `n` (the upper bound of the range)

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(n - 2, -1, -1)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the start value `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to the stop value `-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - The condition `n - 2 >= -1` must be true.
   - Simplifying this condition: `n - 2 >= -1` implies `n >= 1`.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `i` should be set to the start value of the range, which is `n - 2`.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `ii` is 0 (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0 (unchanged, but `n` must be at least 1)
- `a` is a list of integers (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `t` is a string (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t` (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l - 1` (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l + 1` (unchanged, not in the loop head)
- `i` is `n - 2` (adjusted to the start value of the range)

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l + 1`, `i` is `n - 2`**
