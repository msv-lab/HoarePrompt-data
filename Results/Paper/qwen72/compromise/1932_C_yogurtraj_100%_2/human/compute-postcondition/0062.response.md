Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is set based on the last character of `t`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', the last element of `y` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, the last element of `y` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. Additionally, the character at index `i` in `t` is 'R'.**
