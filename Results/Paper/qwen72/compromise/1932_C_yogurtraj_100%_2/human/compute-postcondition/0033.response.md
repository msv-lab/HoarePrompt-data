Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `i` is `n - 3`, and `y[n - 2]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l + 3`, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is `l - 4`, `q2` is `l + 2`, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`.**
