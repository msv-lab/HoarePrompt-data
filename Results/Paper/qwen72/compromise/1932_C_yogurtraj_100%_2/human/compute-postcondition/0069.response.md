Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is updated to either `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on the value of `t[i]`, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 3` depending on the last character of `t`, `q2` is either `l + 1` or `l + 2` depending on the last character of `t`, `y[i]` is now equal to `k`.**
