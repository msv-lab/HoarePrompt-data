Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is -1 (but will be set to `n - 2` by the loop), `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.**
