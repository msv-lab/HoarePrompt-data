Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array and the calculation of the product modulo `m` for each command. Specifically, the logic for updating `q1` and `q2` is flawed, leading to incorrect indices being used for the product calculation.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output is:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program will produce:
```
0 2 4 4
```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - Array `a`: [3, 1, 4, 2]
   - Modulo `m`: 6
   - Commands: "LRRL"

2. **First Command (L):**
   - Product: \(3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \mod 6 = 24 \mod 6 = 0\)
   - Remove the leftmost element: [1, 4, 2]
   - Expected output: 0

3. **Second Command (R):**
   - Product: \(1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \mod 6 = 8 \mod 6 = 2\)
   - Remove the rightmost element: [1, 4]
   - Expected output: 2

4. **Third Command (R):**
   - Product: \(1 \cdot 4 \mod 6 = 4 \mod 6 = 4\)
   - Remove the rightmost element: [1]
   - Expected output: 4

5. **Fourth Command (L):**
   - Product: \(1 \mod 6 = 1\)
   - Remove the leftmost element: []
   - Expected output: 1

However, the program fails to correctly update the indices `q1` and `q2` for the product calculation, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic for `q1` and `q2` is not correctly tracking the positions of the elements that should be removed and used in the product calculation.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve maintaining the product of the current state of the array and updating it as elements are removed. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input()
        
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        results = [product]
        
        for command in commands:
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[0], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[-1], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop()
            results.append(product)
        
        print(*results[:-1])
```

This corrected version maintains the product of the current state of the array and updates it by multiplying with the modular inverse of the removed element to ensure the product remains correct modulo `m`.
