Output State: **`ans` is a string containing the characters of `s` rearranged in such a way that the characters are ordered by their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`, and `d` remains a sorted list of tuples containing indices and their corresponding depths.**
