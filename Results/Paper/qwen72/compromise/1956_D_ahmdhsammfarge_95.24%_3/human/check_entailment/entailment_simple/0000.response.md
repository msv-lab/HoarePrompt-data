### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of elements in the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the problem guarantees that the maximum sum can always be achieved within this limit.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the input and initializes the list `lst` with the given integers.
     - It also initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is designed to find the subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the array if the subarray `[i, j]` is replaced with its MEX.
     - The MEX of a subarray is not explicitly calculated, but the sum is compared to the current maximum sum.
     - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function is intended to recursively add operations to the `ops` list.
     - However, it seems to have a logical error. The function is supposed to add operations to replace the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX, but it does not correctly handle the recursive calls and the operations it appends.

   - **Function `func_3`:**
     - This function is designed to perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` and update the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
     - If the minimum value in the subarray is 0, it appends the operation again.
     - It then appends another operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` (which seems redundant).
     - It calls `func_2` to add more operations, which is problematic due to the issues in `func_2`.
     - Finally, it replaces the subarray `[r, l]` with the MEX of the subarray, which is the length of the subarray `n`.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - The main loop repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and `func_3` to perform the operation.
     - The loop continues until `r` equals `l`, which is a termination condition.
     - After the loop, the program tries to replace all 0s in the list with 1s, which is a valid step to maximize the sum.

   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the final sum of the array and the number of operations performed.
     - It then prints each operation in the `ops` list.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The recursive calls in `func_2` are incorrect. The function appends the same operation multiple times and does not correctly handle the subarray replacement.
  - The function should be simplified or removed if it is not necessary.

- **Function `func_3`:**
  - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` which is redundant and does not contribute to the solution.
  - The recursive call to `func_2` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect operations being added to `ops`.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle the operations and may produce incorrect results due to the issues in `func_2` and `func_3`.
- The main idea of finding the optimal subarray and replacing it with its MEX is correct, but the implementation of the operations is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the way it handles the operations, particularly in `func_2` and `func_3`. These issues can lead to incorrect or redundant operations being added to the `ops` list, which may prevent the program from achieving the maximum sum of the array.
