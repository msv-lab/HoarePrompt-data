### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations are limited to no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(lst)`**:
     - This function is supposed to find the subarray that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced by its MEX.
     - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.
     - The function correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum, but it does not compute the MEX. Instead, it assumes the MEX is the length of the subarray squared, which is incorrect.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
     - This function is intended to append operations to the `ops` list.
     - It recursively appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times.
     - The function does not actually perform the MEX operation on the array, but it appends the operations to the list.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
     - This function performs the actual operation on the array `lst`.
     - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the length of the subarray `n`.
     - The function also ensures that the minimum value in the subarray is no longer 0 by appending additional operations.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main loop repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then calls `func_3` to perform the operation.
   - After the loop, the program tries to replace any remaining 0s in the array with 1s.
   - The program then prints the final sum of the array and the list of operations.

4. **Issues**:
   - **MEX Calculation**:
     - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray length, which is not the MEX.
     - The correct approach would be to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

   - **Redundant Operations**:
     - The function `func_3` appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than required.
     - The function also appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` and calls `func_2` recursively, which further adds redundant operations.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.
   - The program may perform more operations than necessary, potentially exceeding the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and may perform more operations than necessary, potentially exceeding the allowed limit.
