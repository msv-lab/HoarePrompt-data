Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the goal is to maximize the sum, not necessarily to minimize the number of operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray `[i, j]` is replaced by its MEX.
   - However, the MEX is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - The function returns the indices of the optimal subarray and the maximum possible sum.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The MEX calculation is incorrect, leading to incorrect subarray selection and sum calculation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is intended to recursively add operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and recursively calls itself with `l - 1`.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX and does not handle the subarray replacement correctly. It simply appends the same operation multiple times without any actual computation of the MEX.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is supposed to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray and update the operations list `ops`.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and appends the operation again if true.
   - It then appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and recursively calls `func_2`.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray `[r, l]` to the length of the subarray.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX and the recursive calls are flawed. It sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of a subarray.
   - The recursive functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly handle the subarray replacement and the operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the sum is maximized or that the operations are valid according to the problem constraints.

**Final Evaluation**:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the MEX and the operations to replace subarrays are flawed.
- The program fails to meet the problem requirements and does not maximize the sum of the elements in the array.

Final: **False**
