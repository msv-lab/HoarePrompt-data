### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(lst)`**:
     - This function finds the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - It calculates the sum of the array excluding the subarray from `i` to `j` and adds the square of the length of this subarray.
     - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that results in the maximum sum.
     - The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
     - This function recursively appends the operation indices `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list.
     - It ensures that the operation is applied to the subarray from `r` to `l` multiple times, depending on the difference between `l` and `r`.
     - The function does not modify the list `lst`.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and updates the `ops` list with the necessary operations.
     - It appends the operation indices `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, including once for the entire subarray and once for each element in the subarray.
     - It sets all elements in the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the length of the subarray `n`.
     - The function returns the modified list `lst`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic starts by reading the input and initializing the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum and then applies the operation using `func_3`.
   - The loop continues until no more subarrays can be found that increase the sum.
   - After the loop, it attempts to replace all remaining 0s in the list with 1s, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

4. **Correctness**:
   - **Maximizing the Sum**:
     - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - The function `func_3` correctly applies the operation and updates the list and operations list.
     - The loop ensures that the operation is applied until no further improvement can be made.

   - **Handling Remaining 0s**:
     - The try-except block correctly handles the case where there are remaining 0s in the list, replacing them with 1s and appending the necessary operations.

   - **Operation Count**:
     - The number of operations is limited to \(5 \times 10^5\), which is sufficient given the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly maximizes the sum of the elements in the array and constructs a sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
