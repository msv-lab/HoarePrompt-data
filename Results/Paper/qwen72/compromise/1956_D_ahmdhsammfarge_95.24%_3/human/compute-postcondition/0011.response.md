Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`). The function also appends several lists to `ops`, including `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times and `[r + 1, r + 1]` once. The function returns the modified list `lst`, ensuring that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged. **
