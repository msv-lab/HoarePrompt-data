Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 6 to `n-1` plus 16. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 4, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 (`sum(lst[:i])`) plus the sum of elements from index 6 to `n-1` (`sum(lst[j + 1:])`) plus 16 (which is `(j - i + 1) ** 2`).
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if sm > over_sum` is not evaluated in this snippet, so the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` will only change if this condition is true in the context of the full program. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to 2, `l` is set to 4, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.
