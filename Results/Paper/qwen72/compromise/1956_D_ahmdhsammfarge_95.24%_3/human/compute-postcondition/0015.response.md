Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 9, `r` is 0, and `l` is 1. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 1.

```
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. `i` is 0, so `lst[:i]` is an empty list, and `sum(lst[:i])` is 0.
2. `j` is 3, so `lst[j + 1:]` is `lst[4:]`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 4 to the end.
3. `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `(3 - 0 + 1) ** 2` which is `4 ** 2` which is 16.
4. Therefore, `sm` is calculated as `0 + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.

The new value of `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`, `r` is 0, and `l` is 1. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 1.**
