Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[n-1]` plus `(n-2)^2`, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged and has a length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`.
- The variable `i` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` will have iterated through all possible values from `i + 1` to `n-1`, so it will end up being `n-1`.
- The variable `sm` will be the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last elements, plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` (which is `n-2`).
- The variable `r` will be 1 if the loop found a new maximum `sm` during any iteration.
- The variable `l` will be the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found.
- The variable `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` that was found during all iterations of the loop.
