The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `lst`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least 5 elements (i.e., `n` must be greater than 4).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18` and `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 4. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
