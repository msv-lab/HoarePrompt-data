Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 4, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `r` and the value of `j` (which is 3) to `l`.
- The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `over_sum`) are not affected by this code.
- Therefore, `r` is now 1, `l` is now 3, and the rest of the initial state remains the same.
