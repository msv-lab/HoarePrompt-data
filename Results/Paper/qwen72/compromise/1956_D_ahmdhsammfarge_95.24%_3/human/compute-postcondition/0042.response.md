Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 4 to `n-1` plus 4, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop, and the current value of `sm` is greater than the current value of `over_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`.
- `i` is 2, so `r` is now 2.
- `j` is 3, so `l` is now 3.
- All other variables (`lst`, `n`, `sm`, `over_sum`) remain unchanged.
