The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `j`, which is from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`. Given that `i` is 2, `len(lst)` must be greater than 3. The initial state of `j` should be `i + 1`, which is 3.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[n-1]` plus `(n-2)^2`, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**
