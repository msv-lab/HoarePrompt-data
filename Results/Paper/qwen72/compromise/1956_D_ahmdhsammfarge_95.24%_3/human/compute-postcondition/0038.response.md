The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- The length of `lst` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[n-1]` plus `(n-2)^2`, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**
