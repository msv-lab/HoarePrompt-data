Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**

The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The initial conditions for `lst`, `r`, `l`, and the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remain unchanged. The `ops` list now includes this new sublist.
