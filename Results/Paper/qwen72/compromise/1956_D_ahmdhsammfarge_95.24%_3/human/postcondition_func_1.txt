The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can store lists of integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, depending on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value, but the `ops` list will contain the appended pairs after the function concludes. The number of appended pairs is determined by the difference between `l` and `r`.
