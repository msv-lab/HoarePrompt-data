Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations is flawed. The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k` and, if so, prints `k - 1`. However, this approach does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations or the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Card Number**: Use a dictionary or a list to count how many times each card number appears.
2. **Determine the Minimum Number of Cards Left**:
   - For each card number, calculate the remainder when the count of that card number is divided by `k`.
   - If the remainder is 0, then all cards of that number can be exchanged completely, and no cards of that number will be left.
   - If the remainder is non-zero, then the minimum number of cards left for that number is the remainder.
   - Sum up the minimum number of cards left for all card numbers.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards_left = sum((count % k for count in p))
        print(max(1, min_cards_left))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Count the Frequency**: `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` creates a list of counts for each unique card number.
- **Calculate Minimum Cards Left**: `min_cards_left = sum((count % k for count in p))` calculates the total number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
- **Ensure at Least One Card**: `print(max(1, min_cards_left))` ensures that the output is at least 1, as you cannot have zero cards left.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand for each test case.
