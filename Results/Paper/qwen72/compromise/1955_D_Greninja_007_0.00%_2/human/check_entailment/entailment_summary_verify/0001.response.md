### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements). This is a correct and efficient way to handle the frequency counts.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the frequency in either array. This is correct and ensures that the initial matches are accurately counted.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` and update the count of matches.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - If the number of matches is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.
     - It adjusts the frequency and matches count by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the element that is sliding into the window.
     - The program correctly updates the `window_freq` counter and the `matches` count.
   - The logic for updating the matches count is correct. When an element slides out of the window, the program decreases the matches count if the element was part of the matches. When an element slides into the window, the program increases the matches count if the element can contribute to the matches.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good and updates the count of good subarrays if necessary. This is a crucial step to ensure that the last window is also considered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of good subarrays for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `b_freq = Counter(b)` correctly initializes the frequency counter for `b`.
  - `window_freq = Counter(a[:m])` correctly initializes the frequency counter for the first window of `a`.

- **Initial Matches Calculation:**
  - `matches = sum((min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq))` correctly calculates the initial number of matches.

- **Sliding Window Loop:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n - m)` iterates through all possible windows of length `m` in `a`.
  - `if matches >= k: good_subarrays += 1` correctly increments the count of good subarrays if the current window is good.
  - `if a[i] in b_freq: matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])` correctly decreases the matches count when an element slides out of the window.
  - `window_freq[a[i]] -= 1` and `if window_freq[a[i]] == 0: del window_freq[a[i]]` correctly update the frequency counter for the element that slides out.
  - `if a[i + m] in b_freq: matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])` correctly increases the matches count when an element slides into the window.
  - `window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1` correctly updates the frequency counter for the element that slides into the window.

- **Final Check:**
  - `if matches >= k: good_subarrays += 1` correctly checks the last window and updates the count of good subarrays if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for counting matches and updating the window is sound. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

### Correctness:
