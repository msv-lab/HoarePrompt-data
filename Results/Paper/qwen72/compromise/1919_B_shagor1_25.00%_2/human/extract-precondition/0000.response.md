Precondition: **The function should actually take two parameters: `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-') and `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). Additionally, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, so the input should include an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases.** 

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `s` for each test case.
