Output State: **The function should actually take two parameters: `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-') and `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). Additionally, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, so the input should include an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. `s` is a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-', `n` is an input integer, and `t` is an input integer.**
