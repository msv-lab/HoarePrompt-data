Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the penalty based on the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg` and `n` otherwise. This is incorrect because the penalty should be the sum of the penalties of the subarrays after optimally splitting the array.
   - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This is not what the program is doing.

2. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal strategy is to split the array into subarrays where each subarray has a sum of zero (if possible). If a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero.
   - If it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero, the program should consider the smallest possible non-zero sums and minimize their contribution to the total penalty.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, you should iterate through the string and keep track of the sum of the current subarray.
- Whenever the sum of the current subarray becomes zero, you can start a new subarray.
- If the sum of the current subarray does not become zero, the penalty for that subarray should be calculated as the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.

### Example:
For the input `s = "+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.

For the input `s = "--+++++++-"`, the optimal split would be `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `4 + 0 = 4`.

The given program does not follow this optimal approach and thus is incorrect.
