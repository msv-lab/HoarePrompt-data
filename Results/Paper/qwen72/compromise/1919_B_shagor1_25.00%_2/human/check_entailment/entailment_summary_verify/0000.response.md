Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '-' characters and uses a formula to calculate the penalty, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Let's break down the issue in more detail:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal split should consider the sum of subarrays and their lengths to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Function `func_1` Behavior:**
   - The function counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - It then calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.
   - This formula does not consider the sum of subarrays or the optimal way to split the array.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `+-+-+`, the array `a` is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`.
   - The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - However, the program calculates the penalty as `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect because the optimal split should result in a penalty of `0`.

4. **General Case:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not a general solution for minimizing the penalty.
   - It fails to account for the possibility of zero-sum subarrays, which can significantly reduce the penalty.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
