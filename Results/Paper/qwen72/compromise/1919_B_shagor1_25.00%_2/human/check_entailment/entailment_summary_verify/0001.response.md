### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character `+` corresponds to `1` and each character `-` corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in the string and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The penalty of a subarray is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
   - The optimal way to split the string is to ensure that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is equal, the string can be split into subarrays with a sum of zero, resulting in a total penalty of zero.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the optimal split will still try to balance the sums as much as possible, but there will be a residual penalty.

4. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the idea that each `+` and `-` pair can be balanced to zero, reducing the penalty.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty by balancing as many pairs as possible.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters, and the penalty is simply the length of the string `n`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string consists entirely of `+` or `-` characters.
   - It also handles the case where the string has an equal number of `+` and `-` characters, resulting in a penalty of zero.

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the formula and the logic behind it.
   - However, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not always correct. Consider the case where the string is `+--++`. Here, `n = 5` and `neg = 2`. According to the formula, the penalty would be `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, but the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1], [1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`.

7. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula to calculate the minimum penalty is `abs(n - 2 * neg)`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, ensuring that the penalty is always non-negative and minimized.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The formula used is incorrect, and the program does not handle all edge cases as expected.

**Final: False**
