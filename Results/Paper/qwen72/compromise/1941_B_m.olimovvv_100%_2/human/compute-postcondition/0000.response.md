The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not relevant to the loop's execution condition. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the input value for the loop must be greater than 0.**
