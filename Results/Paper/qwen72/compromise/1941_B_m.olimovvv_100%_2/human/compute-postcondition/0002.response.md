The function `func` is expected to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, with the constraint 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `n` is less than 3, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` must be at least 3.
- Case_2: For each test case, the function returns some computed value based on the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is the length of the list `a` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). If `n` is less than 3, the function returns an error message. Otherwise, for each test case, it returns a computed value based on the list `a`.**
