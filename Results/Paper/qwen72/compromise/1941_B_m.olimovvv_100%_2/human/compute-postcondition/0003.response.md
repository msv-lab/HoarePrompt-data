Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. It then iterates through the list `b` and modifies its elements according to specific operations. If at any point an element in `b` becomes negative, or if the last two elements of `b` are not both zero after the loop, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t` and `n`. The list `b` is modified during the process but is not retained after the function concludes. **
