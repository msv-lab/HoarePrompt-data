### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then determines the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means all diagonals must have at least one colored cell. In this case, the minimum number of cells to color is \( n \) (since each cell on the main diagonal or anti-diagonal can cover 2 diagonals, and \( n \) cells are needed to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals).
   - For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( n \) (which is \( k // 2 + 1 \)).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) using the `ceil` function.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly.
   - For other values of \( k \), the function correctly computes the minimum number of cells to color.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The output for each test case matches the expected results based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells to color for each test case. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
