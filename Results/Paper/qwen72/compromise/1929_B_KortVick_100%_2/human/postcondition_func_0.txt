The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). It then prints the number of ways to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration of the loop, but `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
