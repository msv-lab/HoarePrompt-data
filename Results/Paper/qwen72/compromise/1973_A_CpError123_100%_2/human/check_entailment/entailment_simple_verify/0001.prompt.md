You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and it should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by a different set of p_1, p_2, and p_3 values.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases, each defined by a different set of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Reading Scores:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all the points of the two lower-scoring players were from draws.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the sum of the points of the two lower-scoring players (`y`).

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Valid Sum Check:**
  - The check `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

- **Total Games Calculation:**
  - The calculation `x = (a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of games played, given that each game contributes 2 points.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
  - The calculation `y = a + b` is correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all the points of the two lower-scoring players were from draws.
  - The `min(x, y)` ensures that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played or the sum of the points of the two lower-scoring players.

### Edge Cases:

- **All Scores Zero:**
  - If `a = b = c = 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.

- **One Draw:**
  - If `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one game ended in a draw.

- **Invalid Scores:**
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because the total sum is odd, making the scores invalid.

- **Maximum Draws:**
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because the total number of games is 2, and both games could have ended in draws.
  - If `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the total number of games is 6, and the maximum number of draws is 6 (all games could have ended in draws).

- **Large Disparity:**
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the total number of games is 6, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (since `a + b = 2`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
