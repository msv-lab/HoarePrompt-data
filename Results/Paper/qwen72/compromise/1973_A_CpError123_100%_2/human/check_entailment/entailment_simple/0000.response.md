### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases in a loop.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd using the condition `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a set of games (where each game results in 2 points for a win or 1 point each for a draw) must always be even.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which is the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points to the total score).
   - It calculates `y` as `a + b`, which is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `x = (a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of games played.
   - The formula `y = a + b` is used to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. This is because the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores (`a` and `b`) is the maximum number of points that could have been distributed as draws, assuming the highest score `c` is the result of wins only.
   - The minimum of `x` and `y` is printed to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For the test case `0 0 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the test case `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw could have occurred.
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the test case `1 1 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred.
   - For the test case `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the test case `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because six draws could have occurred.
   - For the test case `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred, and the rest of the points could be from wins.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases, and the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is sound.
