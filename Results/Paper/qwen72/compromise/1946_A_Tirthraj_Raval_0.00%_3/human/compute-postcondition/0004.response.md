The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The integer `n` must satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer in the list must satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is based on the input list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input list of integers.**
