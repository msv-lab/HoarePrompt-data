The function `func` reads an integer `t` and a list of `t` strings from the user. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function terminates.
