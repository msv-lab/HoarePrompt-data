Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count2` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `done` remains False.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
