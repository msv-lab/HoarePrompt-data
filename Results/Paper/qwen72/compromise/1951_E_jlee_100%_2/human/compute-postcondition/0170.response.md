The code snippet provided is simply `print(1)`. This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the initial state of the variables and objects described in the precondition.

To break it down step by step:
- The precondition describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement only prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **1**
