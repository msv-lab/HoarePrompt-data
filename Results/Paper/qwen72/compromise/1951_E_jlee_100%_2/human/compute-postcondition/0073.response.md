Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and the current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False.***
