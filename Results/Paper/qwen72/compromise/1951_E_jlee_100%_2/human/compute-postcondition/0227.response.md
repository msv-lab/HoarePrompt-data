To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- The conditions for `count` and `count2` and `done` are provided, but they do not affect the value of `string`.

Given that the `print(string)` statement is executed, the value of `string` is not modified by any of the conditions described. Therefore, the output will be the original input string `string`.

Output: **string (where string is the original input string)**
