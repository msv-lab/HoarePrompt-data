Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1, `count2` is 0, `count` is less than 1, `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since `continue` does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
