Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `count` remains less than 1, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, which is `string[0]`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1 is checked.
   - If this condition is true, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, and `done` is True.
   - If this condition is false, `count` remains less than 1, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` will be the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

4. **Values of `string[:j]` and `string[j:]`:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the condition, the print statement will always split the string `string` into the first character and the rest of the string. The condition does not affect the slicing of the string, as `j` is always 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello":
Output: **h, ello**
