Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
            continue
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the position of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first occurrence of a character not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False if the loop has not exited due to a condition being met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (if such a character exists and `count` was not set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (if `count` was set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), and `done` is False if the loop has not detected a condition that leads to a 'YES' output. If `done` was already True, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False. If `done` was initially False, the program maintains all the initial conditions and `done` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
