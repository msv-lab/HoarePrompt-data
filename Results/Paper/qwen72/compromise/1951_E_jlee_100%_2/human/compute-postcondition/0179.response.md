Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` is False. Additionally, the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n - 1 - j]`).**
