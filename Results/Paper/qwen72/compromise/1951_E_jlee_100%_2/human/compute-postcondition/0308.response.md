Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in the list `s` that is not equal to `x` (if such a character exists and `count` was not set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), `count2` is the number of characters in the list `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (if `count` was set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), and `done` is False.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
