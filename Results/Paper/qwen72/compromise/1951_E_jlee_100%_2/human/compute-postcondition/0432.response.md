Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count` is 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, and `done` is set to True, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is not equal to `count` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False.***
