Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `done` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
