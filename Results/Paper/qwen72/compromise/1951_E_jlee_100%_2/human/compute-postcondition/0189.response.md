Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of `done` remains unchanged.***
