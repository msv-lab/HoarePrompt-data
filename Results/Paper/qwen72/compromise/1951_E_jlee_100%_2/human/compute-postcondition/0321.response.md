Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If `s.count(x) == n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
