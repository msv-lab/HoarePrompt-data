Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
