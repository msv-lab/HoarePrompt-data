Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in the new `s` that is not equal to `x` (if such a character exists and `count` was not set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), `count2` is the number of characters in the new `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (if `count` was set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), and `done` is False.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. None of the variables are modified by this statement, so their values remain unchanged.
