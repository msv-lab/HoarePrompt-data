Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`.
- `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
- Otherwise, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `s` and String `string`**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is given that `n > 2`.

2. **Variables `x` and `j`**:
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
   - `j` is 2.

3. **Conditions**:
   - If `s[j]` (i.e., `s[2]`) is not equal to `x` (i.e., `s[0]`) and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
   - `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`.
   - `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

4. **Loop and `continue` Statement**:
   - The `continue` statement is mentioned, but it is not part of the code snippet provided. This suggests that the `continue` statement is part of a loop that is not shown, and it will skip the rest of the current iteration if certain conditions are met.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print('YES')` will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state. The conditions and variables mentioned do not affect the execution of the print statement directly.

Output: **YES**
