Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is 0, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
