Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, `count` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
