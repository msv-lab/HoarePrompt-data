Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than 0. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
