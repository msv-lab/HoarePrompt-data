Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
