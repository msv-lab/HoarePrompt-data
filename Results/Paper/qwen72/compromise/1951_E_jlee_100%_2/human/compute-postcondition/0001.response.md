The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0. The state of `s` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6**
