Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is 0, `count` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
