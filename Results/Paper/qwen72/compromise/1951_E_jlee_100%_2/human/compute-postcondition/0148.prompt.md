Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` > 1, `done` is True and `count2` is equal to `count`. If `count` <= 1, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1. If `count` is 0, then `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
