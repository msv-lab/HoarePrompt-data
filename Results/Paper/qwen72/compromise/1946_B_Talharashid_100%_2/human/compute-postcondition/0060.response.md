Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, the input for the loop range must be greater than 1.**

The initial value of `maxi` was the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution, but since `maxi` is now explicitly set to 0, its value is updated to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
