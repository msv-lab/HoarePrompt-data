Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.
- If the current element `ele` is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is reset to 0, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value of `c` observed so far.
- If the current element `ele` is non-negative or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value of `c` observed so far.
- After the loop completes, `c` will be the sum of the positive elements in `l` that were not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value was greater than or equal to the current sum.
- `maxi` will be the maximum value of `c` observed during the entire loop execution.
