Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, and `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and the current value of `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, if `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0.***
