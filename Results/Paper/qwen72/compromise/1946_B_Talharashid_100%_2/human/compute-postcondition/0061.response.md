The only objects in the loop head are `ele` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, but it does not specify whether `l` has any elements. To ensure the loop executes, `l` must have at least one element, and `ele` will be the first element of `l`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
