To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least `n` elements.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0.
- `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which represents the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0.
- `maxi` is now the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `2 ** k`**:
   - `2 ** k` is the value of 2 raised to the power of `k`.

2. **Calculate `2 ** k * maxi`**:
   - This is the product of `2 ** k` and `maxi`.

3. **Calculate `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**:
   - This is the result of subtracting `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi`.

4. **Calculate `sum(l)`**:
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

5. **Calculate the final expression**:
   - The final expression is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This expression first computes the sum of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` and `sum(l)`, and then takes the result modulo 1000000007.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`k`**: A positive integer provided by the user.
- **`maxi`**: The maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0.
- **`sum(l)`**: The sum of all elements in the list `l`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `maxi`, and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the user-provided positive integer, maxi is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list l before any negative element reset c to 0, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
