Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution, the input for the loop range must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
