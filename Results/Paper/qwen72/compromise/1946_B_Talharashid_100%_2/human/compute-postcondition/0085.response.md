The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The exact nature of the result for each test case is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case based on the parameters `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of parameters, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of `n`, `k`, and `a`.**
