Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of moves `k` is 0. According to the problem description, when `k` is 0, the initial state of the board has no rooks placed, and the number of possible final configurations should be calculated based on the entire `n x n` board. However, the current implementation of the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output 1, which is not the correct number of possible configurations for an empty board.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 0
```
The expected output should be the number of possible configurations for a 4x4 board with no initial rooks, which is not 1. The program will output 1, which is incorrect.
