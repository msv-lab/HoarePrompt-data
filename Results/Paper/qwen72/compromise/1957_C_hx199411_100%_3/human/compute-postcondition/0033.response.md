To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3, and `i` starts from 3.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is now `t - 1`
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input
- Each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid
- `i` is `k-1`
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input
- `m` is not equal to 0
- `m` is not equal to 1
- If `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k` and `m` is `n - k`
- Otherwise, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - (2k - m)`
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` should start from 3, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
