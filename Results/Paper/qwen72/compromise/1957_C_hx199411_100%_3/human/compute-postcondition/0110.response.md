Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **User Input Variables:**
   - `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`.
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - The current value of `m` is 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(1)`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print(1)` statement executes.

### Analysis:
- The value of `m` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- The print statement `print(1)` does not depend on any of the other variables (`c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`).
- The print statement simply prints the integer 1.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer 1, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **1**
