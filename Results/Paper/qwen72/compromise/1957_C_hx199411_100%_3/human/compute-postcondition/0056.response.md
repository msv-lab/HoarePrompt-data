Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. If `m` is 0, `m` is `n - k` regardless of whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. If `m` is 1, `m` is `n - k` if `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, otherwise `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers with the specified values if `m` is not 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `c` and `r`.
- The initial state specifies that `c` and `r` are integers provided by user input, which is updated by the code snippet.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged and are still valid after the code snippet is executed.
