Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 3, `m` is `n - 2`, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
