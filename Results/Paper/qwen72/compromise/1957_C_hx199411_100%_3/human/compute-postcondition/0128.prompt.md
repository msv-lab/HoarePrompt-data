Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `m` is 0, `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k`, and `m` is `n - k`. If `m` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k` and `m` is `n - k`. If `m` is 1 and `c` is not equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. If `m` is not 1, the loop has finished executing, `i` is `m`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 110, and the subsequent values up to `dp[m]` are calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program retains the initial values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`. If `m` is 1, the program retains the initial values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 17, and `dp[5]` set to 73. For each `i` from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program remains unchanged. If `m` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 31, `dp[5]` is 63, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is computed as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
