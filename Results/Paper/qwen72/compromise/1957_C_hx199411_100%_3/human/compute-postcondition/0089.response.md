Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`.** 

The value of `num` is reset to 0. The values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is now equal to `n` minus `num`, which is `n - 0` or simply `n`.
