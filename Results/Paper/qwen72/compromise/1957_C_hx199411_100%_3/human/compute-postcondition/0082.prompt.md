Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 17.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 5, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 17, `dp[5]` is 73.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
