Output State: **`t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `m` is 0, `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k`, and `m` is `n - k`. If `m` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k` and `m` is `n - k`. If `m` is 1 and `c` is not equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. If `m` is not 1, the loop has finished executing, `i` is `m`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 110, and the subsequent values up to `dp[m]` are calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. `n` and `k` are now the integers provided by the user input.**
