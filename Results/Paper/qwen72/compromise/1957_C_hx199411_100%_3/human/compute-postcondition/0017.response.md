The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer provided by the user input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
