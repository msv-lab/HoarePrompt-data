Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `dp[3]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Given `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` becomes `(3 + 2 * 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which simplifies to `(3 + 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, resulting in `5 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is 5.
- The values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, `m`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` remain unchanged.
