Postcondition: ***`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program retains the initial values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`. If `m` is 1, the program retains the initial values of `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 17, and `dp[5]` set to 73. For each `i` from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.***
