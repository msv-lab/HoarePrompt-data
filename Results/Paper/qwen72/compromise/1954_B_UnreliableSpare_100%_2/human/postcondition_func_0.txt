The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `n`.
