The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) on the next line. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
