Reasoning:

The program provided aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but not called with the correct parameters. The function should accept `n` and `arr` as parameters, but it is called without any arguments in the main block. This is a critical error that would cause the program to fail.

2. **Handling of `flag` Variable**: The `flag` variable is used to check if all elements in the array are the same. If all elements are the same, the array is inherently beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Consecutive Elements**: The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`val`). However, this approach is flawed because:
   - It only considers sequences of consecutive elements that match the first element.
   - It does not account for sequences of consecutive elements that match other elements in the array.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not just the minimum length of a sequence of the same elements.

4. **Use of `Decimal` and `math` Libraries**: The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` and the `math` library is unnecessary for this problem. A simple integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` would suffice.

5. **Output for Non-Uniform Arrays**: For arrays where not all elements are the same, the program should find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no operation can make all elements the same. The current approach only considers the first element and its consecutive sequences, which is insufficient.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incomplete and does not cover all cases.

Correctness: **False**
