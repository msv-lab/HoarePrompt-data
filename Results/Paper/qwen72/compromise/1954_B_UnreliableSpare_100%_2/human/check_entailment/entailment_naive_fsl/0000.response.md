Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program outputs `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `1`. By removing the element at index 5 (0-based index), the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

The issue lies in the logic where the program tries to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
