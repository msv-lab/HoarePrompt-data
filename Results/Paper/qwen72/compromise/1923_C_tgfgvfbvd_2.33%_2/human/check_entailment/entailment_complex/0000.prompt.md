Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    NO

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; q queries are provided, each consisting of two integers l_i and r_i where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers based on user input, l is a list of integers based on user input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l. For each of the m queries, a and b are integers based on user input. If a - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, s is equal to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains equal to p[b - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It then computes a list `p` of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For each of the `m` queries, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, calculates a value `s` based on the cumulative sums in `p`, and checks if the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
