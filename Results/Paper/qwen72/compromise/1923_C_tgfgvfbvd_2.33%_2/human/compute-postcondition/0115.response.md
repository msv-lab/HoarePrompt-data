Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.** 

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value at index `a - 2` in the list `p` from the current value of `s`. The value of `s` was initially `p[b - 1]`, so after the subtraction, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
