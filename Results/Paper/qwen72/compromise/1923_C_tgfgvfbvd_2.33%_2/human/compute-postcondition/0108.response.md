To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - `x` is the last element of the list `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1.
   - The value of `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Subarray Length Condition:**
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1. This means that `b - a + 1 > 1`, or equivalently, `b - a > 0`.

2. **Value of `s`:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. Therefore, `p[b - 1]` is the cumulative sum up to index `b - 1`, and `p[a - 2]` is the cumulative sum up to index `a - 2`.
   - The difference `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` gives the sum of the subarray from index `a - 1` to `b - 1`.

3. **Condition on `s`:**
   - The value of `s` must be at least twice the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive). This means `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the conditions are met (the subarray length is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray), the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
