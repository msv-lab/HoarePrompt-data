Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated to the value of `p[b - 1]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
