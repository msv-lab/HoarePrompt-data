The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` updates the value of `s` by subtracting the value of `p[a - 2]` from the current value of `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. After executing the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
