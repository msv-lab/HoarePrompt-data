You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; q queries are provided, each consisting of two integers l_i and r_i where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers based on user input, l is a list of integers based on user input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l. For each of the m queries, a and b are integers based on user input. If a - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, s is equal to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains equal to p[b - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of list `c`), `q` (number of queries), a list `c` of integers, and a list of `q` queries. For each query, the function processes the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` and returns the result of this processing for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
