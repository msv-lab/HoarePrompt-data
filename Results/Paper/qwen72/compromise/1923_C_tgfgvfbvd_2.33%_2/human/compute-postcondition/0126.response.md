To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `a` and `b` are new input integers.
   - `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - `x` is the last element of the list `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints 'NO'.

Given the conditions and the print statement, we need to determine if the condition is met or not. If the condition is not met, the print statement will execute and print 'NO'.

Let's analyze the condition step by step:

- **Condition 1:** `a - 2 >= 0`
  - This means `a` must be at least 2 for this part of the condition to be true.
  - If `a < 2`, then `s` is simply `p[b - 1]`.

- **Condition 2:** `b - a + 1 > 1`
  - This simplifies to `b - a > 0`, which means `b` must be greater than `a`.

- **Condition 3:** `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`
  - This checks if the value of `s` meets a certain threshold based on the difference between `b` and `a`.

If any of these conditions are not met, the print statement will execute and print 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine if the condition is met. However, the print statement is designed to print 'NO' if the condition is not met.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
