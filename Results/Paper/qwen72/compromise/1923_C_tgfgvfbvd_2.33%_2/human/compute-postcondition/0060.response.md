The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p` to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `m` is greater than 0, `_` is `m + 1`, and `a` and `b` are input integers. However, the list `p` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]` (assuming `p` is defined and `b - 1` is a valid index).**
