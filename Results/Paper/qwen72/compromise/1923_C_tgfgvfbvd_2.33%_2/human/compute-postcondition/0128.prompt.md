Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 1, m is greater than 0, a and b are input integers, n and m are now the integers from the input split by space, s is updated based on the conditions within the loop, l is a list of integers from the input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element of the list l.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 0, m is greater than 0, a and b are input integers, n and m are now the integers from the input split by space, l is a list of integers from the input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element of the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is updated to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains unchanged. Additionally, if the length of the subarray from index a to b (inclusive) is greater than 1 and the value of s is at least twice the length of this subarray, the condition holds. If the length of the subarray is less than or equal to 1, or if s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the new input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
