Output State: **`_` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is at least 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from its current value, which was initially `p[b - 1]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The current value of `a` is still at least 2, as specified in the initial state.
