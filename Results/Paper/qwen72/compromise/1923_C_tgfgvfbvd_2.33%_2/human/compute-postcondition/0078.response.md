Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`. If `a` is less than 2, `s` remains `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `_` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the user input, which are integers.
- The value of `s` is determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`. If `a` is less than 2, `s` remains `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
