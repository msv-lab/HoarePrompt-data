Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` and `m` are integers based on user input.
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers based on user input.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
