Postcondition: **`_` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains the value of `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, the difference `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1, and `s` is at least twice the value of `(b - a + 1)`.**
