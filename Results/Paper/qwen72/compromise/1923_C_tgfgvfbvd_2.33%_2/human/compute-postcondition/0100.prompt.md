Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `s` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `s` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, `c` is equal to the first element of the list `l`, `x` is the first element of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `s` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l` and the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of the first and second elements of the list `l`, `x` is the second element of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `s` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, and the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of the first, second, and third elements of the list `l`, `x` is the third element of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
