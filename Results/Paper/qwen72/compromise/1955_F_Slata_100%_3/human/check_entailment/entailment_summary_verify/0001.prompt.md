You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200` for each `p_i` in `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`). For each set of four integers, it calculates the sum of their integer divisions by 2, plus an additional 1 if exactly three of the first three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. The result of this calculation is printed for each iteration. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - The game ends when the sequence is empty.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - The XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, and the XOR of 2 and 4 is 6. However, since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, the only relevant pairs are:
     - 1 XOR 1 = 0
     - 2 XOR 2 = 0
     - 3 XOR 3 = 0
     - 4 XOR 4 = 0

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) as much as possible.
   - If the count of any number is odd, Eve can remove one of that number to make it even, which will help Bob win.
   - If the count of all numbers is even, Bob wins. If the count of all numbers is odd, Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even using integer division by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3. If it is, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that one more number can be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even.
   - The additional check for the sum of remainders being 3 is correct because it ensures that if there are three odd counts, one more number can be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.
   - The program does not consider the count of 4s in the additional check, but since 4 XOR 4 = 0, it does not affect the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
