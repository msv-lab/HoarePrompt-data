### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - The winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of zero with any number is the number itself: \( 0 \oplus x = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can remove pairs of numbers that are the same, as removing pairs will not change the XOR (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)).
   - If there are an odd number of a particular number, removing one of them can change the XOR to zero if it was previously non-zero.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, which represents the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - It adds an additional 1 if exactly three of the first three counts (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. This is because if exactly three counts are odd, removing one of these will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 0`
     - Calculation: \(1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3)\)
     - Result: \(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Bob wins once when one number is removed.

   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `1 0 1 2`
     - Calculation: \(1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3)\)
     - Result: \(0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 1\)
     - Bob wins once when one number is removed.

   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `2 2 2 0`
     - Calculation: \(2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + \text{int}(2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3)\)
     - Result: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\)
     - Bob wins three times when pairs are removed.

   - **Example 4:**
     - Input: `3 3 2 0`
     - Calculation: \(3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + \text{int}(3 \% 2 + 3 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3)\)
     - Result: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\)
     - Bob wins three times when pairs are removed.

   - **Example 5:**
     - Input: `0 9 9 9`
     - Calculation: \(0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + \text{int}(0 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 == 3)\)
     - Result: \(0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 12\)
     - Bob wins twelve times when pairs are removed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The logic of counting pairs and adding an extra win if exactly three of the first three counts are odd is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
