Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads four integers (a, b, c, d) and prints the result of the expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`. The value of t remains unchanged, and the values of a, b, c, and d are not retained between iterations.**
