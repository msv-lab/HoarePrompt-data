To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each of the four integers `p_i` in the test cases is an integer such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. If `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided does not directly affect the loop head, but it is important to understand the context of the input.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: This variable is automatically managed by the `range` function and starts at 0.
- **`int(input())`**: This must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value. The input value must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each of the four integers `p_i` in the test cases is an integer such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\), `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
