### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix starts filled with zeroes.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Choose a row and a permutation, then assign the permutation to the row.
   - **Type 2**: Choose a column and a permutation, then assign the permutation to the column.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than `2n` operations.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided function `func` does the following:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and the size `n` for each test case.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes an `n x n` matrix with permutations of integers from 1 to `n` for each row.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2 \cdot i + 1)\).
4. **Output**:
   - It prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations `2 * n`.
   - It prints `n` rows of type 1 operations and `n` rows of type 2 operations, each using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Function Summary:
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an integer `n`.
- **Output**: For each test case, it prints the maximum sum `res`, the number of operations `2 * n`, and the operations themselves.
- **Operations**: It prints `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations, each using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2 \cdot i + 1)\) is used to calculate the sum `res`.
   - For `n = 1`, the sum should be \(1 \cdot (2 \cdot 0 + 1) = 1\).
   - For `n = 2`, the sum should be \(1 \cdot (2 \cdot 0 + 1) + 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 + 1) = 1 + 6 = 7\).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The function always prints `2 * n` operations.
   - For `n = 1`, it prints 2 operations, which is more than the required 1 operation.
   - For `n = 2`, it prints 4 operations, which is within the limit of `2 * n`.

3. **Operations Validity**:
   - The operations are valid as they use permutations of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The operations are applied to both rows and columns, which is allowed by the problem description.

4. **Special Case `n = 1`**:
   - The function prints 2 operations for `n = 1`, which is incorrect.
   - The correct output for `n = 1` should be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 1 1
     ```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the special case when `n = 1` properly. It outputs 2 operations instead of 1, which violates the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
