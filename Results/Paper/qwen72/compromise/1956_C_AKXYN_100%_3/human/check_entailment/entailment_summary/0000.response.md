Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an n√ón matrix using at most 2n operations. The operations are:
   - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
   - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to n.
   - Each element in the matrix will be one of these integers, and the sum of the matrix will be the sum of all integers from 1 to n, repeated n times.
   - The sum of integers from 1 to n is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the total sum of the matrix is \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to n for each row.
   - It calculates the sum `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\).
   - This formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations `2 * n`.
   - It then prints the operations, alternating between row and column operations, using the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each operation.

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations are valid and will indeed fill the matrix with the integers from 1 to n.
   - However, the sum `res` is calculated incorrectly, which means the program will not output the correct maximum sum.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for performing the operations is correct, but the sum calculation is incorrect.
   - Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for the correct maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
