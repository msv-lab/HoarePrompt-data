Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is defined as `n - 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is a formatted string `'2 %d' % i`. This will print the string "2" followed by the value of `i`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will print all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

4. **Values:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The formatted string will be "2" followed by the value of `i`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The sequence of integers from 1 to `n` will be printed after the formatted string.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the string "2" followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`), followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n-1] [n] (where [n-2] is the value of `n - 2` and the sequence 1 2 3 ... [n-1] [n] represents the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive)**
