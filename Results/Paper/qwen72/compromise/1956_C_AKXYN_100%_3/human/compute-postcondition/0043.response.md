Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` must still be greater than 0 (since the loop started with `n` and decremented `i` from `n` to 1). The loop iterates from `n` down to 1, and after the last iteration, `i` is decremented to 0. The loop then terminates because the next value of `i` (which would be -1) is not greater than 0. The variables `res` and `mat` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
