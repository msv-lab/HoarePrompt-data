Let's break down the given code and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be the same as `n`.

2. **First Part of the Print Statement**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `'2 %d' % i`.
   - This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The value of `i` (which is `n`) will be substituted into the placeholder.
   - So, the first part will print `2 [n]`, where `[n]` is the value of `n`.

3. **Second Part of the Print Statement**:
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will first print `2 [n]`, followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 3, then `i` is also 3.
- The first part will be `2 3`.
- The second part will be `1 2 3`.

### General Case:
- For any value of `n` greater than 0, the output will be `2 [n]` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2 [n] 1 2 ... [n] (where [n] is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
