The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` set to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
