Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The first part of the print statement is a formatted string `'1 %d' % i`. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the value that will be inserted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into the print statement.

4. **Determine the Values**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The formatted string will be `'1 %d' % i`, which will print `1` followed by the value of `i`.
   - The unpacked range will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
- The string `1` followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-2`).
- Followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is the value of n)**
