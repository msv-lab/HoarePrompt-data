The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is 7, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`**
