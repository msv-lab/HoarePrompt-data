Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n - 2`, and `n` is greater than 2, `i` will be a positive integer.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `i = 5 - 2 = 3`.

2. **Format the string '1 %d' % i**:
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted to include the value of `i`.
   - For example, if `i = 3`, the string will be `'1 3'`.

3. **Generate the range**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the range will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Unpack the range**:
   - The `*` operator in the print statement will unpack the range, so each element of the range will be printed as separate arguments.
   - For example, if the range is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the print statement will output `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will first output the formatted string `'1 %d' % i`, followed by the unpacked range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The exact output will depend on the value of `n`, but we can describe it generally.

Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of `i` and `n` is the value of `n`)**

For example, if `n = 5`, the output will be:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
