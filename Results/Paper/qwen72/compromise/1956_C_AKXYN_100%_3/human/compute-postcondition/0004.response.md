The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, and it will increment with each iteration. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `mat`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
