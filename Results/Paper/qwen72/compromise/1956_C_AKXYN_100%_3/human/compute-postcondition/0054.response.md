Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the sum of ((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)) for i from 0 to `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` remains unchanged**: The value of `n` does not change throughout the loop execution.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop terminates.
- **`res` is the sum of ((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)) for i from 0 to `n-1`**: The variable `res` is incremented by the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the final value of `res` is the sum of these increments over all iterations.
