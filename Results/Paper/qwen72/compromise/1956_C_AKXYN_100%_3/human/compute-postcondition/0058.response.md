Let's break down the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is using a format string `'2 %d' % i` where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - `i` is equal to `n` based on the initial state.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive) into the `print` statement. This means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The format string `'2 %d' % i` will be replaced with `'2 n'` where `n` is the value of `i`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'2 n'` followed by the integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the integers from 1 to n are printed in sequence)**
