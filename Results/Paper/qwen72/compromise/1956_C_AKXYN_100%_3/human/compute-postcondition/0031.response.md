The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it.

- `i` is 2.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- `res` is initially 7, so after the update, `res` becomes `7 + 15 = 22`.

The values of `n` and `mat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is 22, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**
