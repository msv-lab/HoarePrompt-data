You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop processes t test cases, where for each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the list `a` that appear twice in the first half of the list until k pairs are printed. If fewer than k pairs are found, it prints additional integers from the first half of the list that appear only once until 2k integers are printed. It then prints the remaining integers from the first half of the list that were not printed in the previous steps. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of the list that appear twice until the number of printed integers from the first half matches the number of printed integers from the second half.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `l` and `r`**:
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with length `n`, but they should be initialized with length `2k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Filling `l` and `r`**:
   - The program attempts to fill `l` and `r` by counting occurrences of elements in the first half and second half of the array `a`. However, it does not correctly ensure that the subsets `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that their XORs are equal.

3. **Handling of `k`**:
   - The program modifies `k` in the middle of the loop, which can lead to incorrect behavior. Specifically, it sets `k = 2 * k - ul`, which can result in `k` being a negative value or an incorrect value for the second part of the loop.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not always ensure that the output format is correct. It may print fewer or more elements than required, or it may not print the correct number of elements in `l` and `r`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 2
1 2
```
However, the program will output:
```
1 1
2 2
```
This output is incorrect because the subsets `l` and `r` should be of length `2k` (which is 2 in this case) and their XORs should be equal. The program fails to correctly form the subsets and ensure the XOR condition.

### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Splitting the array `a` into two halves.
2. Finding subsets of length `2k` from each half such that their XORs are equal.
3. Ensuring the output format is correct and the subsets are valid.

The provided program does not handle these steps correctly, leading to potential failures in various cases.
