The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear twice until `k` pairs are printed. If fewer than `k` pairs are found, it prints additional integers from the first half of `a` that appear only once until a total of `2k` integers are printed. It then prints the remaining integers from the first half of `a` that were not printed in the previous steps. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of `a` that appear twice until the number of printed integers from the first half matches the number of printed integers from the second half. The function does not return any value.
