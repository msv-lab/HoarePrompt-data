### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of distinct types of cards and `k` is the number of coins (which can be used to buy new cards).
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.

2. **Sorting the Initial Card Counts:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to handle the smallest counts first, which is essential for maximizing the score.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to the smallest count in the sorted list `a[0]`. This is because the smallest count will determine the initial number of complete subarrays of length `n` that can be formed.
   - The variable `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, which represents the number of gaps between the smallest count and the next smallest counts.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted List:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` from the second element to the last.
   - For each element, it calculates the difference `dif` between the current element and the previous element.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means the current count is the same as the previous count, so it decrements `res` to account for the gap.
   - If `dif` is not zero, it checks if `k` (the remaining coins) is sufficient to make the current count equal to the next count.
     - If `k` is sufficient, it updates `ans` by adding `dif` and decrements `k` by `dif * (i + 1)`.
     - It also decrements `res` to account for the gap.
     - If `k` is not sufficient, it updates `ans` by adding the maximum possible number of cards that can be bought with the remaining `k` coins, and it updates `res` accordingly.
     - It then sets `k` to zero and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Coins:**
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, it updates `ans` by adding the maximum number of complete subarrays that can be formed with the remaining coins, and it updates `res` to account for any leftover coins.

6. **Calculating the Final Score:**
   - The final score is calculated as `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.
   - This formula accounts for the number of complete subarrays of length `n` that can be formed, plus the number of gaps that can be filled to form additional subarrays.

7. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final score to a list `ans_list`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each score in the list.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sorting the List:** Sorting the list `a` is a valid approach because it allows the program to handle the smallest counts first, which is necessary for maximizing the score.
- **Gap Handling:** The program correctly handles the gaps between the smallest count and the next smallest counts by using the coins to fill these gaps.
- **Remaining Coins:** The program correctly handles the remaining coins by adding the maximum possible number of complete subarrays that can be formed with the remaining coins.
- **Final Score Calculation:** The final score calculation is correct and follows the logic of forming the maximum number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
