Postcondition: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, and `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`. If `k` was initially greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` remains `n - 1`.**
