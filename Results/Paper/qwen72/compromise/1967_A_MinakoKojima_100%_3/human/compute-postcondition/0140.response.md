Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]` and `ans`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` was already a sorted list of integers provided by the user, this operation does not change the values in `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain the same as described in the initial state.
