Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 0, the difference between the first two elements of `a` (`dif`) is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
