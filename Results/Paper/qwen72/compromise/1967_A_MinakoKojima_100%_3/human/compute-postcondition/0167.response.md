Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 2`.** 

The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
