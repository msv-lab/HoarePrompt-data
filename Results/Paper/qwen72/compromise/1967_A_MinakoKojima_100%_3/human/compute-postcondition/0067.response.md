Output State: **`ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += res` adds the value of `res` to `ans`.
- `ans` was initially `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1)`.
- `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1.
- Since `k` is 0, the condition `0 % n` does not change `res`.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
