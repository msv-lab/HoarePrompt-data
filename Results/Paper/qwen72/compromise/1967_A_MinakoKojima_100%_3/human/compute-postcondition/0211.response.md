The code snippet provided is:
```
print(a)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `ans_list` is a list that contains the final `ans` value for each test case.
- `ans_list` must have at least three elements.
- `a` is the third element in `ans_list`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The list `ans_list` is guaranteed to have at least three elements.
2. The variable `a` is assigned the value of the third element in `ans_list` (i.e., `ans_list[2]`).
3. The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`, which is the third element in `ans_list`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `ans_list` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `a` in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **a (where a is the third element in the `ans_list`)**
