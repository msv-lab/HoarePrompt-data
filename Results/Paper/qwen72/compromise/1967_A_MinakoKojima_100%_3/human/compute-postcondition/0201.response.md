Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `dif` is the difference between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`. If `k` is not 0, `res` is `0 + k % (n-1) + k % n`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by `n-1` (integer division), and `k` is 0. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus the sum of all differences that were added to `ans` during the loop, and `k` is `k - dif * (n-1)`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus the sum of all differences that were added to `ans` during the loop plus `k` divided by `n-1` (integer division), and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, `k` remains 0, `res` is `0 + k % (n-1)`, and `ans` is `a[0]` plus the sum of all differences that were added to `ans` during the loop.**
