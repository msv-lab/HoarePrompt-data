The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, `k` remains 0, `ans` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.**
