Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `a` is a list of length `n` containing integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. `ans_list` contains `ans`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]` and `ans`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `a[0]`, and `ans`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `dif` is the difference between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, `ans` is `ans_initial * n - (n - 1) + res`, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
