Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res` is no longer the value of `ans`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `i` is 0. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - dif` and `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif` or `a[0] + dif + k // 2`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * 2` and `res` is `n - 4` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0 and `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `ans` and `k` remain unchanged, `res` is unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, `res` is increased by `k % 3`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 regardless of the value of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
