The code snippet `ans += k // (i + 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1` to it. Given the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `ans` after this operation.

- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
- `_` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`.
- If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`.
- `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is 0.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. `i + 1` is `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
2. The expression `k // (i + 1)` is `k // 3`.
3. `ans` is updated by adding `k // 3` to its current value (which is 0).

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `k // 3`.

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, if `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`, otherwise `res` is `n - 4`, `ans` is `k // 3`.**
