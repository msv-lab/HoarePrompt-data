Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer provided by the user input where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is now equal to `n - 2`, and `k` is now equal to `k - dif`.**
