You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 25, and `s` is a string that contains the characters appended during each iteration of the loop. The `char_count` list will have values that are the counts of how many times each corresponding character (from 'a' to 'z') was appended to `s` based on the values in `a`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` that contains the characters appended during each iteration of the loop, based on the values in `a` and the counts in `char_count`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` that is constructed by appending characters based on the values in `a` and their corresponding counts in `char_count`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` that contains the characters appended during each iteration of the loop, based on the values in `a` and the counts in `char_count`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
