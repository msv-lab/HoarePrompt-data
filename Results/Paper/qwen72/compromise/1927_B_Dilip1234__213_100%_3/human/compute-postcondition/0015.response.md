Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is the string 'abc'.**

The value of `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')`. Since `j` is 2, `j + ord('a')` is 2 + 97 = 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'ab' + 'c' = 'abc'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
