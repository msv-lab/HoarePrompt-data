Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is the string 'abc', `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In the initial state, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `s` is the string 'abc'. The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value at index 2 of the list `char_count` by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.
