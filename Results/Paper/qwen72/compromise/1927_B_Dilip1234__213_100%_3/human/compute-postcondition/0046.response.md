Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.
- The string `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))`. Since `j` is 1, `chr(1 + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(98)`, which is the character 'b'. Therefore, the new value of `s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzb'. However, the initial state mentioned that `s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by characters added during the loop execution, so the correct new value of `s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'.
