The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range function with the argument `26`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range function, which will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 25 (inclusive). This means the loop will execute 26 times regardless of the initial value of `j`.

However, the initial value of `j` is given as 25, which is the last value that the loop will iterate to. If `j` starts at 25, the loop will not execute because the loop variable `j` will be set to 0 on the first iteration, which is different from the initial state provided. To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be adjusted to a value that is not in the range of the loop, or more specifically, it should be set to a value that allows the loop to start from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution.**
