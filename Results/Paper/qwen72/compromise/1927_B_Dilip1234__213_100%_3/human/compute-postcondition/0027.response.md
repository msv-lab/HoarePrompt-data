The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range of the loop, which is a fixed value of 26. Therefore, we can only adjust `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
