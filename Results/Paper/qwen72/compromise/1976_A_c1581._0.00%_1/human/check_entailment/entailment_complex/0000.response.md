Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to check if a password is strong based on the criteria given in the problem statement. The function performs the following checks:

1. **Digit and Letter Separation**: It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters. This is done correctly by iterating through the password and appending characters to the respective lists based on whether they are digits or letters.

2. **Digit After Letter Check**: It checks if any digit appears after a letter in the password. This is done by maintaining a variable `last_digit_index` to track the last index of a digit. If a letter is found after a digit, the function immediately returns 'NO'. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

3. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the digits and letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `digits` and `letters` lists with their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Return**: If all checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.

The function correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. The input handling and the function logic are consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
