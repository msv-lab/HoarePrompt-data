Reasoning:  
The program is designed to check if a given password meets the criteria for being strong, as described in the problem statement. The criteria are:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes each test case. For each password, it:
- Separates digits and letters into two lists.
- Checks if any digit appears after a letter.
- Checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements these checks. Let's verify each part of the program:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each character in the password and appends it to the appropriate list (`digits` or `letters`).

2. **Check for Digits After Letters**:
   - The program uses a variable `last_digit_index` to keep track of the last position of a digit. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), it returns 'NO'.

3. **Check for Sorted Digits**:
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.

4. **Check for Sorted Letters**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.

If all these conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
