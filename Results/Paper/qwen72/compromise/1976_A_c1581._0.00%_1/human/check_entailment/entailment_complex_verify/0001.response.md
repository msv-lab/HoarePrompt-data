### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input by iterating over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password and the password itself.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described. The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It first separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state after the separation is correctly described. `digits` contains all the digits from the password in the order they appear, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.
   - It then checks if any digit appears after a letter. This is done by tracking the last index of a digit and checking if any letter appears after it. If a letter appears after a digit, the function returns 'NO'.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state after this check is correctly described. `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the password, or -1 if there are no digits. If a letter appears after a digit, the function correctly returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state after this check is correctly described. If `digits` is not sorted, the function correctly returns 'NO'.
   - Finally, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state after this check is correctly described. If `letters` is not sorted, the function correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state after all checks is correctly described. If all conditions are met, the function correctly returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that the length \( n \) is at least 1).
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotated code confirms that the function handles these edge cases correctly.

4. **Logic:**
   - The logic for separating digits and letters is straightforward and correct.
   - The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is also correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is implemented by tracking the last index of a digit and checking if any letter appears after it.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotated code confirms that the logic is implemented correctly and follows the problem's requirements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them all at once, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotated code confirms that the results are collected and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to validate the passwords according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Final: **True**
