You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'NO' if any digit appears after a letter in the string or if the digits or letters in the string are not in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input by iterating over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It first separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then checks if any digit appears after a letter. If it does, the function immediately returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Finally, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that the length \( n \) is at least 1).

4. **Logic:**
   - The logic for separating digits and letters is straightforward and correct.
   - The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is also correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is implemented by tracking the last index of a digit and checking if any letter appears after it.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them all at once, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to validate the passwords according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
