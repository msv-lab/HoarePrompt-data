Postcondition: **`new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` until the bit position specified by `bit` is 0, and `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.**
