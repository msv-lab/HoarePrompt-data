To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur_arr`.

1. **cur_arr**: The loop will iterate over each element in `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.
2. **i**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `cur_arr` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` should be the first element of `cur_arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of integers where 0 <= cur_arr[i] < 2^30 for all i.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not equal to -1.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `cur_arr` to ensure it is not empty. The variable `i` will automatically take the value of the first element in `cur_arr` when the loop starts.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers where 0 <= cur_arr[i] < 2^30 for all i and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
