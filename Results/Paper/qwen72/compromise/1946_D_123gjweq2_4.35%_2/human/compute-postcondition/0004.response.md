Output State: **cur_arr is a list of integers where 0 <= cur_arr[i] < 2^30 for all i, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not equal to -1, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0.**

The variable `xor` is initialized to 0, and the other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
