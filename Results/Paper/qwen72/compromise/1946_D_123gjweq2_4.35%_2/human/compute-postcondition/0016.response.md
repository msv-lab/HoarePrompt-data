Output State: **The program returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.** 

Since `xor` is 0, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0. Therefore, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. The exact value of `thing1` depends on the result of the `find_max` function, which is not provided in the initial state.
