You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in each input string `s` during each iteration. If the string `s` is non-increasing (i.e., it does not have any '0' followed by '1'), it will print the number of transitions plus one. The final state of the variables `s` and `count` will be the last input string and the count of transitions in that string, respectively. The variable `flag` will be 1 if the last string had at least one '0' followed by '1', otherwise it will be 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
0110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Why it fails:**

- The program counts the number of transitions between different characters (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) and adds 1 to the count if the string is already sorted.
- However, the logic is flawed because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

For the input "0110":
- The program counts the transitions: `01` (count = 1), `11` (no transition), `10` (count = 2).
- It then checks if the string is already sorted (flag = 0), and since it is not, it prints `count` which is 2.
- However, the correct output should be 2 because you can cut the string into "01" and "10", and rearrange them to form "0011".

The program incorrectly adds 1 to the count in cases where the string is already sorted, which is unnecessary. It also fails to correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of pieces needed.
