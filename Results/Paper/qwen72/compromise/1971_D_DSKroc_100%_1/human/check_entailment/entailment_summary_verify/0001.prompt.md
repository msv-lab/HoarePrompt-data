You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string. If the string is non-increasing (i.e., it does not have any '0' followed by '1'), it prints the number of transitions plus one. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the number of transitions (or transitions plus one if non-increasing) has been printed for each input string. The variables `s`, `count`, and `flag` will reflect the state of the last processed test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to cut the binary string into the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of cuts needed.
   - It initializes `flag` to 0, which will be used to check if the string is already sorted.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is different from the next character `s[i + 1]`, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is less than the next character `s[i + 1]` (i.e., '0' followed by '1'), it sets `flag` to 1.
   - After the loop, it checks the value of `flag`:
     - If `flag` is 0, it means the string is already sorted, and it prints `count + 1`.
     - If `flag` is 1, it means the string is not sorted, and it prints `count`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for determining the number of cuts is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and add 1 to this count to get the minimum number of pieces.
   - The provided solution counts the number of transitions from any character to a different character, which is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of pieces.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - We need to count the number of times '1' appears before '0' in the string.
   - Each such transition indicates a point where we need to make a cut.
   - The total number of pieces needed is the number of such transitions plus one.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the string "11010":
     - There are two transitions from '1' to '0' (at positions 2 and 4).
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 2 + 1 = 3.
   - For the string "00000000":
     - There are no transitions from '1' to '0'.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 0 + 1 = 1.
   - For the string "1":
     - There are no transitions from '1' to '0'.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 0 + 1 = 1.
   - For the string "10":
     - There is one transition from '1' to '0'.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 1 + 1 = 2.
   - For the string "0001111":
     - There are no transitions from '1' to '0'.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 0 + 1 = 1.
   - For the string "0110":
     - There is one transition from '1' to '0'.
     - Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 1 + 1 = 2.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of pieces.
   - The solution counts all transitions, not just the transitions from '1' to '0'.
