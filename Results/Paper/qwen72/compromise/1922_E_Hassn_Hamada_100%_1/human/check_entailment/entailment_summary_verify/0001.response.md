### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence where elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array can have repeated elements, and different positions of the same elements are considered different subsequences.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the length and elements of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values to find a suitable size and overlap for the sequence.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Binary Representation and Subsequences**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) \) to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by a sequence of a certain length.
   - This formula is derived from the properties of binary numbers and combinations.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning immediately.
   - It also ensures that the sequence is built correctly by appending elements and recursively calling itself.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - If no valid sequence can be generated, the program should print -1. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this case, but it is implied that the function will always generate a valid sequence or terminate early if \( X \) is not feasible.

7. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that `func_1` modifies the `sequence` list by appending a series of integers based on the input `number`.
   - It always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

8. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The logic of the function is based on the binary representation of numbers, which is a valid approach for generating sequences with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function iterates over possible values to find a suitable size and overlap for the sequence, ensuring that the sequence length does not exceed 200.
   - The function appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences, which is a correct approach for building the sequence.

9. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function summary mentions that the function always returns `(0, 0)`, which is not used in the program. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the sequence generation.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated. However, the problem constraints and the function logic suggest that such a case is not expected to occur within the given range of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \) values. The logic and structure of the program align with the problem's requirements, and the test cases provided in the example output are consistent with the expected results. The function summary supports the correctness of the function's behavior.

Final: **True**
