Output State: **The `sequence` list is extended by appending integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`. The values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the `sequence` list.**

Explanation:
- The `sequence` list remains extended by appending integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
- The values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap` remain unchanged.
- The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the `sequence` list. This means that the expression `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` is evaluated and passed as the first argument to `func_1`, and the `sequence` list is passed as the second argument. The result of the function call is not specified, so we only note that the function has been called.
