Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are no longer in scope. The variable `t` remains unchanged. **
