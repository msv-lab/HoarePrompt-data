The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `t` should be a specific integer value provided by the user, which must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a specific integer value provided by the user that must be greater than 0**
