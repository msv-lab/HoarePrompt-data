Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and then removing all occurrences of "map" from `s`. However, this approach is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Substrings Removal**: The function only removes occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`. This means that if "pie" appears in the string after "map" has been removed, it will still be counted. However, the problem requires that the string should be made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters, which means both "map" and "pie" should be considered for removal, not just "map".

2. **Incorrect Counting**: The function counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately and then prints their sum. This is not the correct approach because the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful is not necessarily the sum of the counts of these substrings. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing just 2 characters (the 4th and 9th characters) can make the string beautiful, but the function would output 2 because it only counts the substrings and does not consider the optimal removal of characters.

3. **Optimal Removal**: The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of characters to remove such that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to ensure that the fewest characters are removed.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
