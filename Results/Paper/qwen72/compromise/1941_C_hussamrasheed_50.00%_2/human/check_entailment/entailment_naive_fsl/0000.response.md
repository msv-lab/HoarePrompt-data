Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program only counts and removes the exact substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the possibility of overlapping occurrences or the need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

For example, consider the input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```
The correct output should be 2, as removing the 4th and 7th characters ('p' and 'i') would make the string "pppiepieeee" beautiful by removing the "pie" and "map" substrings. However, the program will output 1 because it only counts and removes the exact substring "pie" once, without considering the overlapping "map" that can be formed after removing "pie".

Another example:
```
1
8
mappppie
```
The correct output should be 2, as removing the 1st and 4th characters ('m' and 'p') would make the string "apppie" beautiful. However, the program will output 2, but it does so by removing "map" and "pie" separately, which is not the minimum number of deletions required.

These cases demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle the problem requirements.
