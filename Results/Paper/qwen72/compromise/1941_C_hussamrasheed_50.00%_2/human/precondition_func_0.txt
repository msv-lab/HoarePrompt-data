The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in a context where the first parameter is a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string `s`, and the next line contains the string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
