#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing n^2 elements. The elements of `li` are arranged in a grid-like pattern where each row starts with `a + k * c` and increments by `d` for each subsequent element in the row. The rows themselves increment by `c` from one row to the next.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'.
    #State: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 elements. The elements of `li` are arranged in ascending order, and `l` is not equal to `li`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It checks if the list `l` can be transformed into a specific pattern where each element is derived from the minimum value in `l` plus a linear combination of `c` and `d`. If the sorted version of `l` matches this pattern, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function does not modify the original parameters but sorts the lists `l` and `li` internally.
