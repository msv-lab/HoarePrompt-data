Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, `k` is 0, `h` is n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `li` will contain `n` elements, starting from the minimum value `a` in the list `l`, and each subsequent element will be incremented by `d`. The last element in `li` will be `a + (n-1) * d`. The variables `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `k` remains 0. The loop counter `h` will be `n-1` after the final iteration.
