The code snippet `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **`li`**: Initially, `li` has `2n-1` elements. After appending the new element, `li` will have `2n` elements.
2. **New Element**: The new element added to `li` is `a + k * c`.
3. **Other Variables**: The values of `n`, `h`, `a`, `d`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, `li` has `2n` elements. The first `n` elements of `li` are `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, and the next `n-1` elements are `[a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-2)]`. The last element of `li` is `a + k * c`.**
