Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value**: The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is used as the base value for constructing the progressive square.

3. **Constructing the Progressive Square**: The program constructs a new list `li` that represents the expected values of the progressive square. Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all pairs `(k, h)` where `0 <= k < n` and `0 <= h < n`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted. The program then checks if the sorted versions of these lists are equal. If they are, it means the input list `l` can form the progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the function `func_1` for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program seems to correctly follow the rules and logic required to solve the problem. The sorting step ensures that the order of elements is considered, and the comparison step accurately determines if the input list can form the progressive square.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
