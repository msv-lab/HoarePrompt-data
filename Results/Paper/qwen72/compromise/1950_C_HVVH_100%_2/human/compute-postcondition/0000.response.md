Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, day is 'AM'.** 

The variable `day` is now set to 'AM', while `t` and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1440, and `s` is still a string in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time.
