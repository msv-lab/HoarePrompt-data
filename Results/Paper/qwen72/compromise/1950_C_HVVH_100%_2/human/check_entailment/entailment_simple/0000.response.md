Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then iterates `n` times to read each time string in 24-hour format. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it correctly converts it to 12 and sets `day` to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it correctly subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it correctly sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - For all other hours (1 to 11), it correctly keeps the hour as is and sets `day` to 'AM'.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses an f-string to format the output as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits (e.g., "09:41 AM").
   - The output format matches the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as "00:00" (12:00 AM) and "12:00" (12:00 PM).
   - It also correctly handles times like "09:41" (09:41 AM) and "21:37" (09:37 PM).

5. **State of the Program**:
   - The comments about the state of the program are accurate. The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `day` will be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the last time input in the loop.
   - The loop correctly prints the time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' for each iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
