Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` is designed to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and append 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

2. **Converting Time:**
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11, it keeps `h` as is and sets `day` to 'AM'.

3. **Printing Output:**
   - The function prints the time in 12-hour format using f-string formatting, ensuring leading zeros are preserved for hours and minutes.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 0 (midnight) by converting it to 12 AM.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 12 (noon) by keeping it as 12 PM.
   - The function correctly handles the transition from AM to PM at 12:00.

5. **Loop and State:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, processing each time input.
   - The state of `day` is updated within the loop based on the current hour, and it is reset for each test case.

6. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each time input correctly.
   - The function prints the converted time in the required format for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
