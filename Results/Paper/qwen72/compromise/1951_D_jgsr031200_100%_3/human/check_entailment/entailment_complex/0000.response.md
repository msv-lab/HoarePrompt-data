### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program also correctly checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than required.

2. **Handling `n >= k`:**
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` list, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and updating `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` is used to keep track of the total number of jewels Alice buys.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `h` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `n == k`**
  - This case is handled correctly. Alice buys exactly `k` jewels at a single stall with a price of 1 coin.

- **Case 2: `n < k`**
  - This case is also handled correctly. Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than required.

- **Case 3: `n >= k`**
  - The program sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
  - The first stall ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible without exceeding `k` jewels.
  - The second stall ensures that Alice buys the remaining jewels needed to reach exactly `k` jewels.
  - The logic of the loop is to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and update the remaining coins and the total number of jewels bought.
  - The final check ensures that the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is exactly `k`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Infinite Loop:**
  - The loop `for i in costs` is finite and will execute exactly twice, so there is no risk of an infinite loop.

- **Correctness of the Stall Prices:**
  - The stall prices `n - k + 1` and `1` are chosen to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The first price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible without exceeding `k`, and the second price `1` ensures that she buys the remaining jewels needed to reach `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `n` is exactly `k` or `n` is less than `k` correctly.
  - For `n >= k`, the program ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls with appropriate prices.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given cases and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible. The logic and the implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
