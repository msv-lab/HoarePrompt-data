The given code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.
