The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'YES'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
