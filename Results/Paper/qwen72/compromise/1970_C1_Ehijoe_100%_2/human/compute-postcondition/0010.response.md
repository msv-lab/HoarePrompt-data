Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `t` is the input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and for each integer `u` from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `nodes[u]` contains a list of integers representing the nodes connected to `u` by the edges provided in the input. `ends` is a list containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection (i.e., their list has exactly one element). `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, and `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`).**
