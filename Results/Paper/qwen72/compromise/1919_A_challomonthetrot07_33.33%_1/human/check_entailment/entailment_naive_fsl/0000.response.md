Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the coin counts and the relative values of `a` and `b` is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

- **Input**: `a = 2`, `b = 3`
- **Expected Output**: `Bob`
- **Actual Output**: `Alice`

In this case, Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 3 coins. According to the problem description, if both players play optimally, Bob should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs `Alice`.

Let's break down the optimal play for this case:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 3 coins.
2. Alice can choose to swap or not swap. If she swaps, the state becomes `a = 3` and `b = 2`.
3. Bob then has to remove a coin, leaving `a = 3` and `b = 1`.
4. Alice can now swap again, leaving `a = 1` and `b = 3`.
5. Bob removes a coin, leaving `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
6. Alice removes a coin, leaving `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
7. Bob cannot swap with Alice (since Alice's wallet is empty) and must remove a coin, leaving `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
8. Alice cannot make a move (since her wallet is empty), so Bob wins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `Alice` because it does not correctly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are greater than 1 and have different parities. The logic should be more sophisticated to handle all possible scenarios.
