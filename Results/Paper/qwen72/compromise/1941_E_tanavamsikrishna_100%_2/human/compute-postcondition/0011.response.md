To determine what will be printed when the `print(min(total_costs))` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved in the computation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`.
   - `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
   - `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d <= m`.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to a corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.
   - `i` is calculated as `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (k - 1)`. This is the number of contiguous subsequences of length `k` that can be formed from the `costs` list.
   - `total_costs` is a list of length `i` (or `n - (k - 1)`), where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.

3. **Computing `total_costs`:**
   - For each index `j` from `0` to `i - 1`, `total_costs[j]` is the sum of the elements from `costs[j]` to `costs[j + k - 1]`.

4. **Finding the Minimum:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will return the smallest value from the `total_costs` list.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `rows`, `d`, and `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of contiguous subsequences of k elements from the costs list)**
