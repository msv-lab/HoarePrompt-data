To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate over the range `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
- The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0` must be true for the loop to execute.
- This can be rewritten as `len(costs) > k - 1`.

### Initial State
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned values from the input.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

### Adjusting the State
- The length of `costs` is `n` because `costs` is derived from `rows`, which has `n` elements.
- For the loop to execute, `len(costs) > k - 1` must be true, which means `n > k - 1` or `n >= k`.

### Final State
- The loop will execute if `n >= k`.
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
- The length of `costs` must be at least `k`.

### State Adjustment
- We need to ensure that `n` is at least `k` for the loop to execute.
- The loop variable `i` is 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list.**
