Output State: **The `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap. The variable `i` remains `d`. The loop has removed all tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
