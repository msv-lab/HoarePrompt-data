To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the `while` loop condition:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - `e := heappop(min_heap)` assigns the result of `heappop(min_heap)` to `e`.
   - `heappop(min_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the min-heap `min_heap`.
   - The condition checks if the second element of the tuple `e` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `min_heap`: This is a min-heap containing tuples.
   - `i`: This is an integer.
   - `d`: This is an integer.

3. **Current State**:
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added.
   - `i` is `d + 1`.
   - `row` is a list of elements.
   - `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
   - Let's denote the smallest element in `min_heap` as `(value, index)`.
   - The condition becomes `index <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given that `i` is `d + 1`, the condition simplifies to `index <= (d + 1) - (d + 2)`, which is `index <= -1`.

5. **Ensuring the Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `index` must be less than or equal to `-1`.
   - Since `index` is the second element of the tuple in `min_heap`, and `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with tuples of the form `(row[i], i)`, the smallest `index` in `min_heap` should be less than or equal to `-1`.

### Conclusion:
- The only way to ensure the loop executes is to have at least one tuple in `min_heap` where the second element (i.e., `index`) is less than or equal to `-1`.
- Since `i` is `d + 1`, and `index` must be less than or equal to `-1`, we need to adjust the state of `min_heap` to include such a tuple.

### Adjusted State:
- `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple where the second element is less than or equal to `-1`.

State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`, `i` is `d + 1`, `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**
