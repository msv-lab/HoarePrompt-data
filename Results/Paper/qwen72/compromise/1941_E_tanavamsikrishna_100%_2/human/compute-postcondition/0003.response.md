Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers. `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**
