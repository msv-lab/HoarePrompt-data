You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row), and for each index `i` in the range 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is increased by 2.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `min_heap` is a valid min-heap containing tuples of the form `(row[i], i)` for all indices `i` from 0 to `len(row) - 1`. The variable `i` is `len(row)`. For each index `i` in the range `d` to `len(row) - 1`, the value of `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The last element of `row` is `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `row` and a positive integer `d` (1 <= d < len(row)). It returns the last element of `row` after updating it based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The updated last element is `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with the specified index condition.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The last element of `row` is `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
