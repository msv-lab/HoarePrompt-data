To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which is a tuple `(value, index)`.
   - `index` is the second element of the tuple `e`.
   - `i` is a variable.
   - `d` is a constant or variable.

2. **Current State:**
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`.
   - `i` is `d + 1`.
   - `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true.
   - This means the `index` of the tuple `e` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - Given `i` is `d + 1`, the condition becomes `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= (d + 1) - (d + 2)`.
   - Simplifying the right side: `(d + 1) - (d + 2) = -1`.
   - Therefore, the condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= -1`.

5. **Current State of `min_heap`:**
   - `min_heap` contains at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `min_heap` already contains at least one tuple with `index <= -1`, and the condition requires `index <= -1`, the loop can execute again without any adjustments to the state.

### Final State:
State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`, `i` is `d + 1`, `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**
