#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row), and for each index `i` in the range 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is increased by 2.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `min_heap` is a valid min-heap containing tuples of the form `(row[i], i)` for all indices `i` from 0 to `len(row) - 1`. The variable `i` is `len(row)`. For each index `i` in the range `d` to `len(row) - 1`, the value of `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The last element of `row` is `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `row` and a positive integer `d` (1 <= d < len(row)). It modifies the elements of `row` such that the first `d` elements are incremented by specific values (the first element is set to 1, and each subsequent element up to `d-1` is incremented by 2). For each element from index `d` to the end of the list, the value is updated to the sum of the smallest element in a sliding window of size `d` (from the beginning of the list up to the current index) plus the current element plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified `row` list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input values for n, m, k, d, and rows from stdin. n and m are positive integers, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. rows is a list of n lists, each containing m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `rows`, `d`, and `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from standard input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` integers, to form a list of lists called `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` represents the depths of the river cells in a row, with the first and last elements being 0. The function computes the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list called `costs`. It then calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs` and stores these sums in a list called `total_costs`. Finally, the function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.
