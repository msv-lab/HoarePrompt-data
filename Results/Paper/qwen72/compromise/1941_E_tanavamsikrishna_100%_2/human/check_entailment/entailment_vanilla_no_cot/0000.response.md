Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `row[0]` and `row[m-1]`**: The function `func_1` initializes `row[0]` to 1, but it should initialize both `row[0]` and `row[m-1]` to 1 because the problem states that a support must be installed in the first and last columns. This is crucial for the correct calculation of the total cost.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Initial Columns**: The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` is incorrect. The cost of installing a support in any cell should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, not `a_{i,j} + 2`. This loop should be adjusted to correctly reflect the cost.

3. **Heap Management**: The heap management in the loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` is incorrect. The condition `i - (d + 2)` should be `i - d - 1` to ensure that the heap only contains valid supports within the distance `d`.

4. **Final Cost Calculation**: The function `func_1` should return the minimum cost of building a bridge in the row, not just the cost of the last column. The final cost should be the minimum value in the `row` array after processing all columns.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` processes each test case but does not handle the input for multiple test cases correctly. It should be wrapped in a loop to handle each test case separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def func_1(row, d: int):
    n = len(row)
    row[0] = 1
    row[n-1] = 1
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    min_heap = [(row[0] + 1, 0)]
    for i in range(1, n):
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i - d:
            heappop(min_heap)
        dp[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] + 1
        heappush(min_heap, (dp[i], i))
    return dp[n-1]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: `row[0]` and `row[m-1]` are set to 1 to account for the mandatory supports at the river banks.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp` is used to store the minimum cost to reach each cell.
3. **Heap Management**: The heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the distance `d`.
4. **Final Cost Calculation**: The function `func_1` returns the minimum cost to build a bridge in the row, which is `dp[n-1]`.
5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` is wrapped in a loop to handle multiple test cases.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
