Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to extract the number of test cases, the dimensions of the river grid, the number of bridges to build, and the maximum distance between supports. It also correctly reads the depths of the river cells for each row.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2. This step ensures that the first `d` elements are adjusted to account for the initial support installation cost.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within a sliding window of size `d+1`. The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` elements as the function iterates through the row.
   - For each element from index `d` to the end of the row, the function updates the cost to be the sum of the current element's depth, the minimum cost from the heap, and 1 (the cost of installing a support).
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for each test case and processes it.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row in the grid to calculate the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and storing these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `d` is 1, as it will always install supports in every cell.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is 1, as it will only consider the cost of a single row.
   - The program ensures that the first and last elements of each row are 0, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost within the sliding window, which is crucial for large values of `m`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
