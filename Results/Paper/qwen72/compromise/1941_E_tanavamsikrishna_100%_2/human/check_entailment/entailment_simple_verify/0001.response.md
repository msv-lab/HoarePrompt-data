### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for installing supports in a single row.
   - The function starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since \( a_{i,1} = 0 \) and the cost is \( a_{i,1} + 1 \)).
   - It then iterates through the first \( d \) cells, adding 2 to each cell's depth (since the cost is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \) and we need to add 1 for the support and 1 for the bridge itself).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the first \( d \) cells.
   - For each subsequent cell, the function ensures that the distance between the current cell and the closest support is no more than \( d \) by popping elements from the heap until the condition is met.
   - The cost for the current cell is then calculated as the minimum cost from the heap plus the cost of the current cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), the number of bridges \( k \), and the maximum distance \( d \).
   - It reads the grid and calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function correctly initializes the first cell's cost to 1.
     - It correctly adds 2 to the costs of the first \( d \) cells.
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for the current cell is always chosen, and the distance condition is maintained.
     - The function correctly returns the cost of the last cell.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It correctly calculates the total cost for \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
     - The function prints the correct output for each test case.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Function 1:**
  - The initial state of the function is correct: `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, and `d` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \le d < \text{len(row)} \).
  - The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` correctly adds 2 to the first \( d \) cells.
  - The min-heap is correctly initialized and used to maintain the minimum costs.
  - The loop `for i in range(d, len(row))` correctly updates the cost for each cell by ensuring the distance condition is met.
  - The function returns the last element of the updated `row`, which is the total cost for the row.

- **Function 2:**
  - The initial state of the function is correct: it reads \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \) from the input.
  - The grid `rows` is correctly read and processed.
  - The list `costs` is correctly populated with the minimum costs for each row using `func_1`.
  - The list `total_costs` is correctly populated with the sums of \( k \) consecutive rows.
  - The function prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.
