Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop, and `k` is recalculated for each iteration. The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop. The value of `k` will be the result of the last calculation performed in the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged.**
