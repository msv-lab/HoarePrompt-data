Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then calculates and prints a value `k` based on the following rules: If `b` is not divisible by 3 and `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the sum of `a` and the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3, and if `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3, it increments `k` by 1. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated `k` for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the ones from the last test case, and `n` will remain unchanged. **
