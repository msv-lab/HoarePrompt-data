Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the overall logic to handle multiple test cases and perform the operations as described is missing. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: `func_3` is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem, but it is not implemented. The function currently only initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case as required.

3. **Subarray Sum Logic**: The logic in `func_2` to find the maximum subarray sum is flawed. It does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum and does not handle the case where the entire array is negative.

4. **Inserting Subarray Sum**: The program does not implement the logic to insert the sum of the subarray back into the array and perform the operations `k` times.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program does not ensure that the final answer is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any input. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
