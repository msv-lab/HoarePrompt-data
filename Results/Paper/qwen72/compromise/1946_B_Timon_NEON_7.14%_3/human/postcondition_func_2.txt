The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `number` and `quantity`, where `number` is an integer and `quantity` is a non-negative integer. It returns an integer value, `answer`, which is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return a list as suggested in the comment.
