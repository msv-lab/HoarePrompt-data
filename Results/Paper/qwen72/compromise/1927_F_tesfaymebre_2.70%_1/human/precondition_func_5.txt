No variables are directly passed to the function `func_6()`. However, the function relies on the existence of a `func_3()` function that returns pairs of integers (n, m) and triples of integers (u, v, w) representing the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the edges with their weights, respectively. The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, and `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is the weight of the edge between vertices u and v. The `DSU` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` for managing disjoint sets and tracking the minimum edge weight in each set.
