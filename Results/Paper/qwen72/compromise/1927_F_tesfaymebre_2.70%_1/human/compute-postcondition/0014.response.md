To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the final values of `_min_edge` and `res`.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` retain their initial values.
- `graph` is updated to reflect the connected components after the loop execution.
- `edges` remains sorted in descending order by weight.
- `dsu` has the nodes unionized based on the edges.
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation.
- `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that were last unionized with the minimum edge weight.
- `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call starting from `node_u` with the initial parent `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`_min_edge`**:
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation in the `dsu` (Disjoint Set Union) structure.
   - Since `edges` is sorted in descending order by weight, the last edge processed in the loop will be the one with the minimum weight.
   - Therefore, `_min_edge` will be the weight of the last edge that was unionized.

2. **`res`**:
   - `res` is the result of a `dfs` (Depth-First Search) function call starting from `node_u` with the initial parent `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.
   - The `dfs` function explores the connected component of the graph starting from `node_u`.
   - The length of `res` will be the number of nodes in the connected component that includes `node_u`.

### Final Output:
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation.
- `len(res)` is the number of nodes in the connected component that includes `node_u`.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation and len(res) is the number of nodes in the connected component that includes node_u)**
