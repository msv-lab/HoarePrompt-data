The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[curr]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[curr]`. If `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, the loop will execute. The variable `nei` will be the first neighbor of `curr` in the list `graph[curr]`.

State: **`curr` is a non-negative integer representing the current vertex in the graph, `parent` is a non-negative integer representing the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `color` of the current vertex (`curr`) is now 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor of `curr` in the list `graph[curr]`**
