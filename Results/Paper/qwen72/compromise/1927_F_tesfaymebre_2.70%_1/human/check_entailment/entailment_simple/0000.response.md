### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program uses several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read and parse input. These functions are designed to handle different types of input (integers, lists of integers, etc.). The use of `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` is appropriate for reading input line by line and stripping whitespace.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Implementation:**
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage connected components in the graph. It correctly implements the `find` and `union` operations, and it also tracks the minimum edge weight in each component using the `min_edge` list.

3. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is a common and efficient way to represent graphs in Python. The edges are stored as a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight, and `u` and `v` are the vertices.

4. **Edge Sorting and Union Operations:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is done to ensure that the program processes the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
   - The union operations are performed correctly, and the program checks if the current edge forms a cycle by comparing the parents of the vertices.

5. **Cycle Detection and Path Reconstruction:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to detect cycles and reconstruct the path. The function uses a color array to keep track of the state of each vertex during the DFS traversal.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a vertex is visited again), the function returns the path.
   - The program correctly updates the `colors` array to avoid revisiting vertices and to mark vertices as processed.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Cycle Detection Logic:**
  - The logic for detecting cycles and updating `_min_edge` is incorrect. The program should only update `_min_edge` when a cycle is detected, not just when two vertices are in the same component. The current logic updates `_min_edge` even if the vertices are already connected, which can lead to incorrect results.

- **DFS Path Reconstruction:**
  - The `dfs` function is not correctly reconstructing the cycle path. It should return the cycle path only when a cycle is detected, and the path should be from the start of the cycle to the end.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the cycle detection and path reconstruction are done correctly. Here is a corrected version of the `func_6` and `dfs` functions:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
import threading

class DSU:

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.size = [1] * n
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, x):
        while self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.parent[self.parent[x]]
            x = self.parent[x]
        return x

    def union(self, a, b, w):
        parent_a = self.find(a)
        parent_b = self.find(b)
        self.min_edge[parent_a] = min(self.min_edge[parent_a], w)
        self.min_edge[parent_b] = min(self.min_edge[parent_b], w)
        if parent_a != parent_b:
            if self.size[parent_a] < self.size[parent_b]:
                (parent_a, parent_b) = (parent_b, parent_a)
            self.size[parent_a] += self.size[parent_b]
            self.min_edge[parent_a] = min(self.min_edge[parent_a], self.min_edge[parent_b])
            self.parent[parent_b] = parent_a
        return

def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    cycle = None

    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            # Cycle detected
            if w < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = w
                cycle = (u, v)
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
    
    if cycle:
        u, v = cycle
        colors = [0] * (n + 1)
        path = []
        dfs(u, -1, path, v, colors, graph)
        print(_min_edge, len(path))
        print(*path)
    else:
        print("No cycle found")

def dfs(curr, parent, path, target, colors, graph):
    if colors[curr] == 1:
        # Cycle detected
        start = path.index(curr)
        return path[start:]
    colors[curr] = 1
    path.append(curr)
    for nei, w in graph[curr]:
        if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
            res = dfs(nei, curr, path, target, colors, graph)
            if res:
                return res
    colors[curr] = 2
    path.pop()
    return []

def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 30)
    threading.stack_size(1 << 27)
    main_thread = threading.Thread(target=func_7)
    main_thread.start()
    main_thread.join()
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is correct after the above corrections.
- **False** if the program is incorrect even after the corrections.

Given the issues identified and the corrections provided, the program should now correctly find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge and output the required results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program has issues that need to be corrected as described above.)
