The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expression`. If `expression` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0, but these variables are not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", and `char` should be the first character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `char` is the first character in `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` == len(`expression`), `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
