### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` by the character `-` to get parts of the string that are sequences of `+` characters. This is done using `parts = expression.split('-')`.
   - However, the summing of the lengths of these parts (`result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))`) is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct calculation of the penalty.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the penalty.
   - It initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`:
     - If the character is `+`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is `-`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
     - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which adds 1 to the count if there is a remaining positive balance.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The goal is to minimize the penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
  - The program's splitting logic by `-` and summing the lengths of the parts is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct calculation of the penalty.
  - The correct approach should focus on balancing the `+` and `-` characters to minimize the sum of each subarray.

- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty.
  - It only counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and adds 1 if there is a remaining positive balance. This does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Correct Approach:

- To minimize the penalty, we should split the array such that each subarray has a sum as close to zero as possible.
- A correct approach would be to iterate through the string and keep track of the current sum. Whenever the sum becomes zero, we can start a new subarray. If the sum does not become zero, we should split the array in a way that minimizes the absolute sum of each subarray.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. The splitting logic and the penalty calculation logic are both flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
