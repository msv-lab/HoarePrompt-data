Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. Let's break down the issues and the specific case mentioned in the assessment:

1. **Logic Issue**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` by the character `'-'`. This approach is fundamentally flawed because the problem does not require splitting the string based on the presence of `'-'`. Instead, the goal is to find a way to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The correct approach should involve iterating through the string and dynamically deciding the best way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The program does not do this; it simply counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive.

2. **Specific Case**:
   - Consider the input `expression = "+-+-+"`. The optimal split, as mentioned, is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The provided program, however, will process the string as follows:
     - Initial balance: 0
     - First character: `+` (balance = 1)
     - Second character: `-` (balance = 0)
     - Third character: `+` (balance = 1)
     - Fourth character: `-` (balance = 0)
     - Fifth character: `+` (balance = 1)
   - The program will count the number of times the balance goes below zero, which is 0, and add 1 if the final balance is positive, which it is. Therefore, the program will return `1`.
   - However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array. For example, if the input were `expression = "--+++++++"`, the program would return `2` (since the balance goes below zero twice and the final balance is positive), but the optimal split would be `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1])`, which results in a total penalty of `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. **General Flaw**:
   - The function `func_1` does not attempt to find the optimal split. It only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive. This is not the same as minimizing the total penalty as described in the problem.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array.

Final: **False**
