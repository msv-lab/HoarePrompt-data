Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. The function `func_1` is attempting to count the number of times the balance (the cumulative sum of 1 for '+' and -1 for '-') goes below zero, and then adds 1 if the final balance is positive. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which is a key part of the problem.

The correct approach to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array in such a way that each subarray has a sum of zero (if possible), because the penalty of a subarray with a sum of zero is zero, which is the lowest possible penalty. If it's not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero, the next best approach is to split the array into the smallest possible subarrays that have the same sign, to minimize the penalty.

The program provided does not attempt to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero. Instead, it only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which is not the correct way to calculate the minimum penalty. For example, in the case of `expression = "+-+-+"`, the correct minimum penalty is 0, but the program would return 3, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
