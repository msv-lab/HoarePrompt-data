Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last integer which is now `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.**

Explanation: The last element of the list `nums` is incremented by the value of `k`. The initial value of each element in `nums` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, so the last element becomes `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
