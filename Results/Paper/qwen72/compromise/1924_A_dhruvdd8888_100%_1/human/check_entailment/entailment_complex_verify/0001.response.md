### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also initializes an empty set `win` and an empty list `ans`.

2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the size of `win` reaches `k`, it means that all `k` alphabets have been seen in the current window. The program then appends `i` to `ans`, increments `ps` (a counter for the number of valid subsequences found), and clears `win`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if the number of valid subsequences found (`ps`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints "YES" and returns.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`:
     - It finds a character `i` in `us` that is not in `win`.
     - It appends this character to `ans` and fills the rest of the string with 'a' to make it of length `n`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The program's logic for checking subsequences is flawed. It only checks if all `k` characters appear in a contiguous window and then clears the window, which does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "abba"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program will only find "ab" and "ba" as valid subsequences, but it will miss "aa" and "bb".

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending a character not in `win` and filling the rest with 'a'. This approach is incorrect because the missing subsequence should be a valid string of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets.
   - For example, if `s = "abb"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly print "aa" instead of "bb".

3. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variable `rrr` is initialized with a random number but is never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases.
  - Each element in cases is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - The program reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
  - It reads the string `s` of length `m`.
  - It initializes `us` with the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
  - It initializes `win` as an empty set and `ans` as an empty list.
  - It iterates over each character `i` in `s`.
    - If `i` is in `us`, it adds `i` to `win`.
    - If `win` contains all `k` unique characters, it appends `i` to `ans`, increments `ps`, and clears `win`.
  - After the loop, it checks if `ps >= n`.
    - If true, it prints "YES" and returns.
    - If false, it prints "NO".
    - It then constructs a missing subsequence by finding a character `i` in `us` that is not in `win` and appending it to `ans` followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

### Evaluation:
- **Subsequence Check:**
  - The program's subsequence check is incorrect. It only checks for contiguous subsequences of `k` unique characters, which is not the same as checking if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

- **Missing Subsequence Construction:**
  - The construction of the missing subsequence is also incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid string of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets.

- **Unnecessary Variables:**
  - The variable `rrr` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
