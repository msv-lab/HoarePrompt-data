Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the input string, `us` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters that were added when the set `win` had all `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times all `k` unique characters were found in a contiguous subsequence of `s`).
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns it.
    #State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the input string, `us` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters that were added when the set `win` had all `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times all `k` unique characters were found in a contiguous subsequence of `s`). Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop does not execute fully because it returns in the first iteration where `i` is not in `win`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged, `win` remains an empty set, and `ps` remains unchanged. The loop returns a string that is the concatenation of `ans`, the first character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m`. It processes the string `s` to find contiguous subsequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such subsequences found is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns 'YES'. If fewer than `n` such subsequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and returns a string that is the concatenation of the characters found in the subsequences, the first character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last subsequence, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
