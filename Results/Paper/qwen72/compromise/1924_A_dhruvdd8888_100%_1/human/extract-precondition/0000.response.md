The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the parameters as described in the problem. Here is the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def check_subsequences(t, cases):
```

Where `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` as described in the problem.

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
