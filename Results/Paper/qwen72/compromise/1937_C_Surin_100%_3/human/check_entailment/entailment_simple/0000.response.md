### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Query Strategy**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0, which will be used to track the index of the maximum value found so far.

2. **First Loop (Finding the Maximum Value)**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and compares the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` with itself to the bitwise OR of `p[i]` with itself.
   - The query `? {v1} {v1} {i} {i}` is used to compare `p[v1]` and `p[i]`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p[i]` is greater than `p[v1]`, so `v1` is updated to `i`.

3. **Second Loop (Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR)**:
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and compares the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` with `p[i]` to the bitwise OR of `p[v1]` with `prev`.
   - The query `? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}` is used to compare `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p[i]` is a better candidate for the second index, so `prev` is updated to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p[v1] | p[i]` is equal to `p[v1] | p[prev]`, and an additional query `? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}` is made to compare `p[i]` with `p[prev]`.
   - If the result of the additional query is `<`, `prev` is updated to `i`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - After the second loop, the program outputs the pair `(prev, v1)` as the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR.
   - The output is flushed to ensure it is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Finding the Maximum Value**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum (`v1`).
  - This ensures that `v1` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

- **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
  - The second loop attempts to find the index `prev` such that `p[prev]` maximizes the XOR with `p[v1]`.
  - The logic of comparing `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]` is correct because it helps in identifying the best candidate for `prev`.
  - The additional query `? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}` is used to break ties when `p[v1] | p[i]` is equal to `p[v1] | p[prev]`, ensuring that the smaller value is chosen.

- **Query Count**:
  - The program makes at most `n-1` queries in the first loop and at most `n-1` queries in the second loop, totaling `2n-2` queries.
  - Since `2n-2` is always less than or equal to `3n` for `n >= 2`, the program does not exceed the query limit.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the pair `(prev, v1)` and flushes the output buffer, ensuring the interactor receives the result.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding a pair of indices that maximizes the bitwise XOR, and it does so within the allowed query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
