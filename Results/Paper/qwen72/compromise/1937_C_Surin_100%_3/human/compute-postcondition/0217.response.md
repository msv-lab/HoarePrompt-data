Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment where it processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function then makes a series of queries to determine a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The function outputs the indices (i, j) that achieve this maximum XOR value. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case and flushed the output buffer. **
