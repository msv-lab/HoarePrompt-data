Output State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `R` function.**

The function operates in an interactive environment where the input sequence is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. A lambda function `R` is now defined to read a line of input and return it as an integer.
