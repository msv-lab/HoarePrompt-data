The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', then the variables retain their initial values.**
