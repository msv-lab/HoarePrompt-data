The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. `prev` is 0.**
