Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code `r = input('')` assigns a new input string to the variable `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has already been flushed as per the initial state, and this code snippet does not affect the buffer state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state information with the updated value of `r`.
