Postcondition: ***`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is equal to '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is equal to '<', `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not equal to '=', `prev` remains 0.***
