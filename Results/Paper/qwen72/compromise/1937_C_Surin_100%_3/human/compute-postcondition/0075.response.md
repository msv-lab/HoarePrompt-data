Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `g = 0` reassigns the value of `g` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the program, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
