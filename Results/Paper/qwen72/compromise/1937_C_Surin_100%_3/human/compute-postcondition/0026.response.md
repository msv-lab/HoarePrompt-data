Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to the value of `v2`, which is 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
