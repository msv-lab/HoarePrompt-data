To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`R`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
2. **`kp`**: Initially set to 0.
3. **`n`**: An input integer greater than 0.
4. **`g`**: Initially set to 0.
5. **`v1`**: The largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.
7. **`v2`**: Also set to `n-1`.
8. **`r`**: The last input string.
9. **`prev`**: The last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively.
10. **Output buffer has been flushed**: This means that any previous output has been processed and is not affecting the current print statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

We need to determine the values of `prev` and `v1`:

- **`prev`**: This variable holds the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively. Since `i` is set to `n-1` at the end of the loop, `prev` will be the last value of `i` that met one of these conditions before `i` reached `n-1`.
- **`v1`**: This variable holds the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.

Since the exact sequence of inputs and the loop logic are not provided, we can only describe the values of `prev` and `v1` in terms of the conditions given:

- **`prev`**: The last value of `i` where `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<'.
- **`v1`**: The largest integer `i` where `r` was '<'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where [prev] is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<', and [v1] is the largest integer `i` for which `r` was '<')**
