Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', `prev` is also set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a string input, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a new string input, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 3. If `r` is '=', `r2` is a new string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 3; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
