The loop head contains the variable `kp` and the expression `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer. This means that the user must input a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0. The variable `kp` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
