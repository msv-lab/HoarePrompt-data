Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is 3.** 

The code snippet `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
