The value of `prev` is set to the value of `i`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. `r2` is the new input string. `prev` is 3.**
