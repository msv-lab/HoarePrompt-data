Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is 1.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to the last `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
   - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `v1` is 0.
   - `v2` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - The string will be `'? 0 0 1 1'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
