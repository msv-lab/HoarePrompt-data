Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a string input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, all the initial state variables remain unchanged.
