Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which is already part of the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.
