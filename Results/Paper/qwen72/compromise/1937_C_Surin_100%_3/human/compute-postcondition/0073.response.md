The only objects in the loop head are the variable `kp` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `kp` being less than the result of `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
