Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is equal to '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the state of the output buffer, which is already mentioned as having been flushed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
