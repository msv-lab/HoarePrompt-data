#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):

    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d[i]` is the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substring `s[0:i]`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` in the order determined by the sorted list `d`, which is based on the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substrings of `s` in ascending order, and by the index in descending order if the differences are the same. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` rearranged according to the sorted list `d`. The list `d` is sorted based on the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substrings of `s` in ascending order, and by the index in descending order if the differences are the same. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the same characters as `s`, but rearranged such that the characters are ordered based on the cumulative difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters up to each index in `s`. The characters are first sorted by the increasing difference, and for characters with the same difference, they are sorted by their index in descending order. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`.
