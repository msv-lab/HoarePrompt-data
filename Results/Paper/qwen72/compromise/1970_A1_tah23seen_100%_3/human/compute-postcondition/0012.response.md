Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the same characters as `s`, but rearranged such that the characters are ordered based on the cumulative difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters up to each index in `s`. The characters are first sorted by the increasing difference, and for characters with the same difference, they are sorted by their index in descending order. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`. **
