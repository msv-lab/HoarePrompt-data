Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 0 or 1.
- `N` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is 2.
- If `cnt[2]` == 1, `tc` is set to 1. Otherwise, `tc` remains 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state, the `print` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
