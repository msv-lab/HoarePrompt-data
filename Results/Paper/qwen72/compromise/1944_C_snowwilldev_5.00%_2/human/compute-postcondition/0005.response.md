Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the integer at the first position in the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) by 1 in the `cnt` defaultdict. The other variables (`tc`, `N`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
