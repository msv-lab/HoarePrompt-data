Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `t` is `t + 1`. If `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is now 2. If `t` was 0 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, the program continues. If `t` is now greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
