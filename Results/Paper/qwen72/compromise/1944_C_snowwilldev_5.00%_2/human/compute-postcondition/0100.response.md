The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array `a`. The function should also handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the results of processing each test case. The specific return value for each test case is not provided, but it is implied that the function will return some form of output based on the array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases internally, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. It processes each test case and returns the results.**
