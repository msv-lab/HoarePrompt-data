Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `tc` is either 2 or 3.
   - `N` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int`, which means it will return 0 for any key that is not explicitly set.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is now 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` is not modified in the code snippet.
   - Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
