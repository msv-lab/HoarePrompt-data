Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `1` in the list `a` by 1 in the `cnt` dictionary. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is the element being incremented. The previous value of `cnt[a[1]]` was 0 (as `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int), so after the increment, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
