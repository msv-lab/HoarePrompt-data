Postcondition: ***`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is now 1. If `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.***
