Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of times `cnt[i]` was 1 for `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and the loop will break if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0 for any `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`. `cnt` is an empty defaultdict with default type int.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that `cnt` is now an empty defaultdict with the default type set to int. This means that if any key is accessed that does not exist in `cnt`, it will be initialized to 0.
