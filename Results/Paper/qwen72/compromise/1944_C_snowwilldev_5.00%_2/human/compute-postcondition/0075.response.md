Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1.
- Initially, `i` is 2, so `a[2]` is incremented in the `cnt` dictionary.
- Since `cnt[a[0]]` and `cnt[a[1]]` were both 1, and `cnt[a[2]]` was initially 1 (as it is the third element in the list), after the execution, `cnt[a[2]]` becomes 2.
- The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The state of `cnt` is updated to reflect the new count of `a[2]`.
