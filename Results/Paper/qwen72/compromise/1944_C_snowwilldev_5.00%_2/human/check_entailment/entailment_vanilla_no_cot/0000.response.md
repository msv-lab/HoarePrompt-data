Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The logic in the program is flawed in how it determines the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then iterates through the numbers to find the smallest number that either does not appear or appears only once, and it prints this number as the MEX. However, this approach does not consider the optimal moves of both players.

### Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally. It simply checks the count of each number and decides the MEX based on the first number that meets a certain condition, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. The program's logic for determining the MEX is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will make strategic choices to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves of both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for num in a:
            cnt[num] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif cnt[i] == 1:
                if (N - i) % 2 == 1:
                    mex = i
                    break
        else:
            mex = N
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`.

2. **Determine MEX**: We iterate through the numbers from 0 to `N-1` to find the MEX:
   - If a number `i` does not appear in the array (`cnt[i] == 0`), it is the MEX.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), we check if the remaining number of elements is odd. If it is, Alice can ensure that this number is included in `c` (since she starts and can always pick the last element if the number of elements is odd), making `i` the MEX.
   - If all numbers from 0 to `N-1` appear at least twice, the MEX is `N`.

This approach correctly simulates the optimal strategy for both players and determines the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends.
