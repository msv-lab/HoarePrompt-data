Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The expected output is 2 because the only way to achieve scores of 1, 1, and 2 is if there were two draws (one between the first and second player, and one between the second and third player), and one win/loss game (where the third player won against the first player).

However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is not correct in all cases.
