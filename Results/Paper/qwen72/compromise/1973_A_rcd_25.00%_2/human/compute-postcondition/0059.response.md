The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers provided by the user, ensuring that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2**
