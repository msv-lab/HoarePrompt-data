Output State: **The loop has finished all iterations, and the value of `_` is `t - 1`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each test case have been processed according to the loop logic, and the appropriate output has been printed for each test case. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the loop has executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. For each test case, the loop has processed the input values `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` according to the specified logic, printing the appropriate output for each case. The input values `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified within the loop body.
