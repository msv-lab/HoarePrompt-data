The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, and the loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2**
