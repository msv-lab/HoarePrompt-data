Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Constraints**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers within the range [0, 30] and are in non-decreasing order.
   - `t` is a variable that must be greater than 1, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `_` is 1, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be even for the print statement to execute. If the sum is odd, the loop continues to the next iteration, and the print statement will not be executed.

2. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even means that the sum \( p1 + p2 + p3 \) is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
   - This condition ensures that the print statement will only execute if the sum is even.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the print statement will only execute if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. The output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is even)**
