Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `health` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is 2, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `2` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `2` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with `success` remaining True.***
