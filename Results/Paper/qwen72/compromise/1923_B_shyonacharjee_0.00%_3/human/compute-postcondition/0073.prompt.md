Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed` (which is equal to `health`), `i` is 0, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If the sum of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `health` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is 1, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `1` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `success` remains True if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed <= time_available`, otherwise `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `health` + `bullets_needed` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is 2, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `2` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `2` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
