Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers input by the user, `positions` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the initial `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is 2, `position` is the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `success` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
