Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has completed all iterations.
- `i` is `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
- `position` and `health` are assigned the values from the last tuple in the `monsters` list.
- `distance` is the absolute value of the last `position`.
- `time_available` is equal to the last `distance`.
- `bullets_needed` is equal to the last `health`.
- `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values from the `monsters` list.
- `success` is `True`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

Since `success` is explicitly stated to be `True`, the condition in the `print` statement will evaluate to `True`, and the string `'YES'` will be printed.

Output: **YES**
