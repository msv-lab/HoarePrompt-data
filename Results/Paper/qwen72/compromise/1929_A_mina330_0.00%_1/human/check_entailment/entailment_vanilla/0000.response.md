### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The program initializes a variable `kq` to store the beauty of the array.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
   - This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in a sorted array is achieved by pairing the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired to maximize the differences.
  - For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - The differences are calculated as follows:
    - \( (5 - 1) + (4 - 2) = 4 + 2 = 6 \).

- **Iterating Through the First Half:**
  - The loop iterates from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, which is the first half of the array.
  - For each iteration, it adds the difference between the element at the end of the array and the element at the start of the array to `kq`.
  - This ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired, and the beauty is maximized.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), resulting in a beauty of `0`.
  - It also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements, as the middle element is not paired and does not affect the beauty calculation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing the largest and smallest elements. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
