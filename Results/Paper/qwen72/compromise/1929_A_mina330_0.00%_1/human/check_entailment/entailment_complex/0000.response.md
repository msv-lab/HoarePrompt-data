### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `ntest` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the array `a` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - The function initializes a variable `kq` to 0, which will store the maximum beauty.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array, calculating the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2`, which ensures that it pairs the largest and smallest elements correctly.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated beauty `kq` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), correctly outputting `0` because the differences between all pairs are zero.
   - The function also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements, as the middle element will not be included in the difference calculation, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and then calculating the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. The input and output handling is also correct.
