Output State: **The variable `kq` will contain the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, for each test case. The loop will print the value of `kq` for each test case, and `itest` will be equal to `ntest` after the loop finishes executing all iterations.**
