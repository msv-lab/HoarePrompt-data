The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` for each test case. The value `k` is determined based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` and the constraints provided. If the conditions `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` are met, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined, while `n` remains unchanged.
