Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t` and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[1] == a[2]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, so `st` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
