The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is provided by the user and must be greater than or equal to 5. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `end` is 0 and `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1. Otherwise, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`.**
