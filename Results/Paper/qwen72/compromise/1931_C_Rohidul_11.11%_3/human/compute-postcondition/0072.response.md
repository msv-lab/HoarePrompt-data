The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3
- `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`
- If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`
- If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `end` is 0 and `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1
- Otherwise, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `end` is 0 and `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1, otherwise, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`.**
