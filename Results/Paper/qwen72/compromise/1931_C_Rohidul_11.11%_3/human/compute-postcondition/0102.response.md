Postcondition: ***`l` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `r` is the index of the last element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are all equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are all equal, `n` must be greater than 1, and the first element of the list `a` is not equal to the last element of the list `a`. If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0 and the first element of the list `a` is not equal to the last element of the list `a`, then `ans` is equal to `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.***
