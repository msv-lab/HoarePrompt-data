Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are all equal, `end` is 0, `ans` is not yet determined, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**

The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
