The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The list `a` contains distinct integers, and its length is between 1 and 10^5, with each integer `a_i` being between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** If an undefined or unmodified variable `n` is used, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** If `k` is the first element of `ind` and is 0, the function returns -1.
- **Case_3:** The function returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, minus 1, where this index is greater than `k` and not 0.
- **Case_4:** The function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is a positive integer less than or equal to `k`.
- **Case_5:** The function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the second element in the list `ind`, and `k` is a variable whose value is not specified.
- **Case_6:** The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Both `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are valid indices, and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`.
- **Case_7:** The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of distinct integers and returns a value based on the index of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, or an error value if certain conditions are not met.**
