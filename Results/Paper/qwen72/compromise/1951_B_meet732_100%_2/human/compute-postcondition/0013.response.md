Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `c` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, the length of `ind` is 1, the first element of `ind` is not 0, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.**
