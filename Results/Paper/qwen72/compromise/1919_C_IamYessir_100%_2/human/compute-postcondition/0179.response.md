Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `a` is a list that now includes the first element of `lit`, and if `a` is no longer empty, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
