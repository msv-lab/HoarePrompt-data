Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x` == `y`, `a` now includes the second element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` < `y` and `x` ≥ `lit[1]`, `a` has one more element appended, which is `lit[1]`, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` > `y`, `a` has one more element appended, which is `lit[1]`, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` ≤ `y`, `y` remains unchanged. If `y` is infinity, it remains infinity. If `x` is infinity, it remains infinity. If `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is the last element of `a`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, then `b` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is not less than `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
