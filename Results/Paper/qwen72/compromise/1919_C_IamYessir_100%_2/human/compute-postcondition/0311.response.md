Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is the last element of `b`.**

The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
