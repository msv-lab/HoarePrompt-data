Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions within the loop, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`. `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1 and the second element of `b` is greater than the first element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1 and the third element of `b` is greater than the second element of `b`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list with at least 4 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1 and the fourth element of `b` is greater than the third element of `b`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
