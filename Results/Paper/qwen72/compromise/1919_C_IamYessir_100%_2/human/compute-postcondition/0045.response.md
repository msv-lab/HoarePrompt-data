Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` == `y`, then `a` contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `x` < `y` and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `a` contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0]` is less than `x`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` is less than `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is less than or equal to `y`.***
