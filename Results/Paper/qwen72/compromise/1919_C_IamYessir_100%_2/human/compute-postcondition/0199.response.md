Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `lit[i] > x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, `a` includes `lit[1]`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[1] <= y`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. If `b` is an empty list, `y` remains infinity.***
