The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `s` is incremented by 1.**
