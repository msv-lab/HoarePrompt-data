Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, `b` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions within the loop, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a[i]` > `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.***
