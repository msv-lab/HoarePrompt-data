Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` has one more element than before, which is `lit[1]`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity. If `a` is non-empty, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[1]`). If `b` is non-empty, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
