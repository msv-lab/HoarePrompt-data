The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**
