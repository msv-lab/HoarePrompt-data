To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
   - `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element.

2. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is calculated by iterating through the list `b` and counting the number of times an element is greater than the element immediately before it.
   - This means `s` is the count of indices `j` (where 1 ≤ j < len(b)) such that `b[j] > b[j-1]`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the count of increasing elements in the list `b`.

Since the exact values of the list `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the count of increasing elements in the list `b`.

Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element)**
