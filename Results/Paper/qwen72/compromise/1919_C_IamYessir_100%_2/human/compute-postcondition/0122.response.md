Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

The value of `cp` is set to 0, which is the same as its initial value, so no change occurs to `cp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
