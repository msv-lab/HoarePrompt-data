Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `b` is a list with the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `y` is now the last element of `b` (which is `lit[1]`). If `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `b` has one more element than before, specifically the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is now the last element of `b` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, `a` has one more element than before, which is `lit[1]`, and `x` is now the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` is less than `lit[1]` or `lit[1]` is less than or equal to `y`, the variables retain their initial values. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity.***
