Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty) is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, `y` is set to `lit[1]`, and `s` is updated accordingly. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty), `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, `a` includes `lit[1]`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[1] <= y`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged.***
