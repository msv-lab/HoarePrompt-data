Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is less than the first element of `lit`, `y` is the last element of `b` (which is the first element of `lit`), and `x` is less than `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` is added to `b`.
- The value of `x` remains less than the first element of `lit`.
- The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the first element of `lit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
