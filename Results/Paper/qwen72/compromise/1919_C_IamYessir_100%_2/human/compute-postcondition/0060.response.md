Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` now includes the second element of `lit` as its last element, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `a`.
- As a result, `a` now includes the second element of `lit` as its last element.
- Since `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `a` is non-empty, `x` is now the second element of `lit`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
