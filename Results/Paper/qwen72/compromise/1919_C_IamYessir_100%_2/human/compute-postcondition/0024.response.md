Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. The value of `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`. `a` now contains the first element of `lit`.**
