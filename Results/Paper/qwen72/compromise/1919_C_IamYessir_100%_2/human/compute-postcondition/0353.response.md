To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, we need to understand the value of `s` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `a` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`.

### Analysis:
- `s` is calculated by counting the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the element immediately before it, and doing the same for `b`.
- This means we need to iterate through `a` and `b` and count the number of times each element is greater than the previous one.

### Calculation:
1. **For list `a`**:
   - Iterate from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For each index `j`, check if `a[j] > a[j - 1]`.
   - If true, increment a counter.

2. **For list `b`**:
   - Iterate from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
   - For each index `j`, check if `b[j] > b[j - 1]`.
   - If true, increment a counter.

3. **Sum the counters**:
   - The value of `s` is the sum of the counters from both lists.

### Example:
- If `a = [1, 3, 2, 4]`, the elements greater than their preceding elements are `3 > 1` and `4 > 2`. So, the counter for `a` is 2.
- If `b = [5, 7, 6, 8]`, the elements greater than their preceding elements are `7 > 5` and `8 > 6`. So, the counter for `b` is 2.
- Therefore, `s = 2 + 2 = 4`.

### General Case:
- Without the exact values of `a` and `b`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`.
- However, we know that `s` is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element and the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`)**
