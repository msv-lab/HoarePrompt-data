Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Alice and Bob's chips are in the same column but on opposite ends of the board (i.e., Alice is in the top row and Bob is in the bottom row or vice versa). In such a scenario, the game should end in a draw because neither player can move into the other's position. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner in these cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 10 1 5 10 5
```
According to the problem description, this should result in a "Draw" because Alice is in the top row and Bob is in the bottom row, and they are in the same column. Neither can move into the other's position. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" for this case.
