Reasoning:
1. **Input Validation**: The function correctly processes the input, which is a list of tuples representing the scores of the three players. It also correctly handles the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Total Points Check**: The function checks if the total points are even (`total_points % 2 != 0`). This is correct because in chess, each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw). Therefore, the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

3. **Total Matches Check**: The function calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total. It then checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches. This is a bit incorrect. The total number of matches should be checked against the sum of the scores, not just 3. Also, `p3` should not be greater than the total number of matches, but this check is not necessary if the total points are valid.

4. **Draw Calculation**: The function calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest and the other two players can be attributed to wins, and the remaining points can be attributed to draws. However, the formula should be simplified to `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and then `egalites // 2` is used to get the number of draws. This is correct in principle, but it needs to be adjusted to handle edge cases correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case `(0, 0, 0)`, no games were played, so the number of draws is 0. This is correct.
   - For the case `(0, 1, 1)`, one draw occurred, which is correct.
   - For the case `(0, 2, 3)`, the function should return -1 because it is impossible to achieve these scores with valid games. However, the function returns 2, which is incorrect.
   - For the case `(3, 3, 3)`, the function should return -1 because it is impossible to achieve these scores with valid games. However, the function returns 0, which is incorrect.
   - For the case `(3, 4, 5)`, the function correctly returns 6.
   - For the case `(1, 1, 10)`, the function correctly returns 2.
   - For the case `(0, 0, 6)`, the function should return 3, which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program has some logical errors in the validation and calculation of the number of draws. Specifically, the conditions for invalid scores are not correctly handled.

Correctness: **False**
