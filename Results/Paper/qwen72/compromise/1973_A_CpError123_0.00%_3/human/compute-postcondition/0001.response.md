The only objects in the loop head are the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the list `cas_de_test`. For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `resultats` is an empty list. These states do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be initialized to the values of the first tuple in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`**
