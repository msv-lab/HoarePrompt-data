Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is set to `False`, and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the state remains unchanged.***
