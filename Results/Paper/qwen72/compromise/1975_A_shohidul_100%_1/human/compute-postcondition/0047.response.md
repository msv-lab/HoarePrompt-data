Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `check_all` is `True` if all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order; otherwise, `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of them. The `print` statement is printing a constant string.

Output: **YES**
