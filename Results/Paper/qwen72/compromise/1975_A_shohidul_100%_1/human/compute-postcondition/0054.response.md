Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
4. `check_all` is `False`.
5. `i` is 1.
6. `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
7. `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
8. `check_all_new` is the result of the expression `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.
9. `new_all` is the result of the expression `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
10. Both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the expressions:

- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. This means `new` contains all elements of `a` except the first one.
- `check_all_new` checks if the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` checks if the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element).

Since both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, it means:
- `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- The elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print "YES".

Output: **YES**
