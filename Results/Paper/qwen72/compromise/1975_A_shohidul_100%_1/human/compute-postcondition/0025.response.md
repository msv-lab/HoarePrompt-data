To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `check_all` is False.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False.
   - `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
