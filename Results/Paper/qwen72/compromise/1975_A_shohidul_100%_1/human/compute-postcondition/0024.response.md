The code snippet `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order (each element is less than or equal to the next element).

- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
- The list comprehension generates a list of boolean values where each value is `True` if the current element is less than or equal to the next element, and `False` otherwise.
- The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the generated list are `True`, indicating that the list `new` is in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `check_all` is False
- `i` is 2
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`
- `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False

After executing the code:
- `new_all` is assigned the result of the `all()` function applied to the list comprehension, which checks if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False.**
