Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
