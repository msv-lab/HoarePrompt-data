### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The function correctly checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.
   - This part of the code is accurate and efficient.

2. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This is the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order.
   - This step is also correct and necessary to identify the potential split point.

3. **Splitting and Checking the New Array:**
   - Once the first out-of-order element is found, the function splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the new array formed by swapping these parts (`a[i:] + a[:i]`) is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Specifically, it checks two conditions:
     - All elements in the new array `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]`.
     - The new array `new` itself should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The initial check for a sorted array is correct and efficient.
- The logic for finding the first out-of-order element and splitting the array is also correct.
- The conditions for checking the new array are logically sound but can be simplified.

### Simplification:
- Instead of checking `check_all_new` and `new_all` separately, we can directly check if the concatenated array `a[i:] + a[:i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- This simplification makes the code more concise and easier to understand.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    if all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, n)):
                        print('YES')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Correctness:
- The corrected program is more concise and maintains the same logic.
- The original program's logic is fundamentally correct but can be simplified.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and the program is correct. The suggested simplification improves readability and conciseness but does not change the fundamental correctness of the solution.

Final: **True**
