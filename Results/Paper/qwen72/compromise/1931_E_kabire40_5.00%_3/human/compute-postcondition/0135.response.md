Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is 1, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together, and `val_in` is the first element of `rev_val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `val_in = rev_val[x]` assigns the value of the first element of `rev_val` (since `x` is 1) to `val_in`.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
