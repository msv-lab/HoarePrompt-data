Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is -1, `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string.**

Explanation:
- `rev_val` is reassigned to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- `x` is now `len(rev_val) - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1` since `rev_val` is now an empty list.
- The other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged, but the content of `rev_res` is now based on the updated `rev_val` (which is empty), so it only contains the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string.
