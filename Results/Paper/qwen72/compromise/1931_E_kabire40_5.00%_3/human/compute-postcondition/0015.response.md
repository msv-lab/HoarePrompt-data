Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` remains an empty string.** 

The code appends the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list` to `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `rev_res` is still an empty string.
