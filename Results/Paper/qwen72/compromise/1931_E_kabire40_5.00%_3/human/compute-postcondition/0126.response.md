Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together, `val_in` is the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`.**

Explanation:
- `val_in` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`, which is `rev_val[0]` since `x` is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- `rev_val` must have at least one element, so `val_in` is a valid integer value.
- The initial state specifies that `x` is an even number, and since `x` is 0, this condition remains true.
