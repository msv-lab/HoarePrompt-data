Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element of `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is set to the second element of `operational_list` concatenated with itself, and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list` and `rev_res` remains the second element of `operational_list`.**
