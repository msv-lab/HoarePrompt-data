Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is -1, `rev_res` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing the first element of `operational_list` and `x`, and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains a string containing only the first element of `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
