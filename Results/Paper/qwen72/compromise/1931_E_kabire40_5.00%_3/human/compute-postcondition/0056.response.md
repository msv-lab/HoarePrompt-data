Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 1 element, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the reversed string of `x`.
- The value of `x` is the first element of `operational_list`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
