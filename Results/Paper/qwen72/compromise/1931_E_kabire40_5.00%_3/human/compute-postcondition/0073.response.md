Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string.**
