The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information since the function signature does not match the parameters mentioned (t, x, n).

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3,
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8,
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

If we assume these parameters are supposed to be part of the function, the correct function signature should be:
```
def func_1(t, x, n):
```

Now, let's describe the functionality based on the provided constraints and relationships:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.**
