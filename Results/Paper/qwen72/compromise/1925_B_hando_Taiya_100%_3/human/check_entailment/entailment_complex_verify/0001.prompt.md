You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` or `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `min(x // n, n)`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the largest divisor of `x` that meets the specified condition.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. The function then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `min(x // n, n)`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that meets the specified condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

2. **Approach**:
   - The key insight is that if `x` is divisible by `n`, then the GCD of the `n` sub-problems can be as large as `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of at least `d`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - Check if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, `i` is a valid GCD.
     - Check if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, `x // i` is a valid GCD.
   - The maximum of these valid GCDs is stored in `ans` and printed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `isqrt` to limit the range of divisors is efficient and correct.
   - The logic for updating `ans` with the maximum valid GCD is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 1` and `n = 1`, the only valid GCD is `1`.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only valid GCD is `1` because each sub-problem must have a difficulty of `1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`:
     - Divisors of `10` are `1, 2, 5, 10`.
     - `10 // 2 = 5` and `n = 3 <= 5`, so `2` is a valid GCD.
     - `10 // 5 = 2` and `n = 3 <= 2` is false.
     - The maximum valid GCD is `2`.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`:
     - Divisors of `5` are `1, 5`.
     - `5 // 5 = 1` and `n = 5 <= 1` is true, so `1` is the only valid GCD.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`:
     - Divisors of `420` include `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`.
     - `420 // 70 = 6` and `n = 69 <= 6` is false.
     - `420 // 6 = 70` and `n = 69 <= 70` is true, so `6` is a valid GCD.
     - The maximum valid GCD is `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD for the given problem. It efficiently checks all divisors up to the square root of `x` and updates the maximum valid GCD.

Correctness: **True**
