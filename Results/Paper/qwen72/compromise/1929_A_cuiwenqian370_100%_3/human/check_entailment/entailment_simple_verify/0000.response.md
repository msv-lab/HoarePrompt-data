Reasoning: 

The original assessment is incorrect in its interpretation of how to maximize the beauty of the array. The problem description specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order, not descending order. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array (in ascending order) will be maximized when the smallest elements are subtracted from the larger elements, which is exactly what the given program does.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The `func_1` function sorts the array in ascending order.
   - Sorting in ascending order ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are positive and maximized.

2. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The program calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Since the array is sorted in ascending order, \(a_i \geq a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\), making \(a_i - a_{i-1} \geq 0\).
   - Therefore, \(|a_i - a_{i-1}| = a_i - a_{i-1}\), which is the correct difference to maximize the beauty.

3. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - For the input `3\n3\n1 2 3`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is correct.
   - For the input `3\n3\n3 2 1`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is also correct.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program's approach of sorting the array in ascending order and then summing the differences between consecutive elements is indeed the correct way to maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The use of `abs` in the calculation is redundant but does not affect the correctness because the differences are always non-negative in a sorted array.

Given this reasoning, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
