### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable for this problem since it reads input directly from `stdin`.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The function correctly identifies the value of Dmitry's favorite cube using `a[f - 1]` (since the index is 1-based in the problem description).

3. **Counting Values**:
   - The function counts the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).
   - The function also counts the number of cubes that have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

4. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the favorite cube will definitely be removed. This is because there are at least `k` cubes with higher values, and they will be removed first.
   - If the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, it means the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. This is because there are not enough cubes with higher or equal values to fill the `k` positions.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the favorite cube may or may not be removed, depending on how the cubes with the same value are arranged. This is correctly handled by the `else` block, which prints "MAYBE".

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" for each test case, which matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
