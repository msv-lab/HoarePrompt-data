Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is an even integer provided by the input.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and alternating elements from the end and start of `array` until the list is filled with `n` elements.
   - `a` is a list containing the integers `n // 2` and `-(n // 2)`.

2. **Understanding the `answer` list:**
   - The first element of `answer` is 1.
   - The second element of `answer` is `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`.
   - The remaining elements of `answer` are filled by alternating between the end and start of `array` until the list has `n` elements.

3. **Constructing the `answer` list:**
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, so `array = [1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - `array[-1]` is `n`.
   - The alternating pattern starts with the second last element of `array` (which is `n-1`), then the second element of `array` (which is 2), and so on.

4. **Example Construction:**
   - If `n = 4`, then `array = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - `answer` will be constructed as follows:
     - First element: 1
     - Second element: `array[-1]` = 4
     - Third element: `array[-2]` = 3
     - Fourth element: `array[1]` = 2
   - Therefore, `answer = [1, 4, 3, 2]`.

5. **General Pattern:**
   - For any `n`, the `answer` list will be constructed as:
     - First element: 1
     - Second element: `n`
     - Alternating between the end and start of `array` until the list has `n` elements.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the construction of the `answer` list, the output will be the elements of `answer` in the order described.

Output: **1 n (n-1) 2 (n-2) 3 ... (where the elements alternate between the end and start of the array until the list is filled with n elements)**

For a specific example, if `n = 5`:
- `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `answer = [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]`
- Output: **1 5 4 2 3**
