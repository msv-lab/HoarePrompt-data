Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` has been appended with the value of `array[a[-1] + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of the list `a` by 1.
- The initial state indicates that `a[-1]` was used to append a value to `answer` from `array`. Since `a[-1]` is now decreased by 1, the next value to be appended to `answer` from `array` would be `array[a[-1] + 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
