Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[-1]`], `a` is [3, -1].**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is 3, which is odd.
- Therefore, `answer` is initially [1, 1, `array[2]`].
- `a` is initially [3, -1].
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends `array[-1]` to `answer` because `a[-1]` is -1.
- The value of `array[-1]` is the last element of `array`, which is `n` (since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive).
- So, `answer` becomes [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[-1]`].
- The states of `t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `array`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
