Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and the value of `array[a[-1]]` twice, or 1, `array[-1]`, `array[a[0]]`, and `array[a[-1]]` depending on the condition, `a[-1]` is `a[-1] - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `a[-1]` is now `a[-1] - 1`.
