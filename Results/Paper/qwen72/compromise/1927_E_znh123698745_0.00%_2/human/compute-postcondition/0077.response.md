Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[3]`], `a` is [3, -1].**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is 3, which is odd.
- Therefore, `answer` is initially [1, 1, `array[2]`].
- `a` is [3, -1] because `i` is odd.
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends `array[3]` to `answer`.
- The new value of `answer` is [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[3]`].
- All other variables remain unchanged.
