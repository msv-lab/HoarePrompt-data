Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided. The input values must satisfy the conditions 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` must be even. The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `_` remains 0. The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
