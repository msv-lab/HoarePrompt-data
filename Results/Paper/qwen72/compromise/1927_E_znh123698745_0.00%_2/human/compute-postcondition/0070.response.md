Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[-1]`], `a` is [2, -2]**.

The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` is [2, -1]. After the execution, the last element `-1` is decreased by 1, making it `-2`. Therefore, `a` is now [2, -2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
