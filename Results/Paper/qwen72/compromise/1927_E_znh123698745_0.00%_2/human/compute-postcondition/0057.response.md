The code snippet `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` reassigns the variable `array` to a new list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. This overwrites the previous value of `array`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and alternating elements from the end and start of `array` until the list is filled with `n` elements, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n // 2` and `-(n // 2)`**.
