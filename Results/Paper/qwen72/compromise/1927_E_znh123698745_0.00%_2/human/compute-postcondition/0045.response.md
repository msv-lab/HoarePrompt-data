Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -3, and `answer` includes `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -2, and `answer` includes `array[a[0]]`.***
