Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation as required by the problem description. The logic used to append elements to the `answer` list does not ensure that the sums of any continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The program simply alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements from the `array`, which does not necessarily produce a k-level permutation.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 4`. The program's output for this case is:
```
1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
```
However, the sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
```
1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22
10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24
2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22
9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24
3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22
8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24
4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22
```
Here, the sums are 22 and 24, which differ by more than 1. Therefore, the permutation is not k-level.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method to ensure that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` are as close as possible to each other. For example, a correct solution might involve alternating between the smallest and largest elements in a way that balances the sums of the segments.
