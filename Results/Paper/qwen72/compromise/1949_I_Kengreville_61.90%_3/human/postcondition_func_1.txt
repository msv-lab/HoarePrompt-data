The function `dfs(i)` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark nodes as visited and appends the indices of visited nodes to the `nodes` list. Additionally, for each unvisited node `j` that satisfies the condition `(r[i] + r[j])
