The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `nodes`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `nodes`. If `nodes` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `nodes`, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, and `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` will be the third element in `nodes`.

State: **`nodes` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` twice.**
