Output State: **`nodes` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` twice.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` increases the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`, where `j` is the third element in `nodes`. The value of `c1` is not affected by this code, so it remains increased by `coef1[j]` twice as per the initial state. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
