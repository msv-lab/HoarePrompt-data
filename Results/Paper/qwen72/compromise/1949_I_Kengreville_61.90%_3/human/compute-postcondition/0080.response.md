Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the coordinates and radii of n disks, where n is an integer between 1 and 1000. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to `False`, `0`, and `1` respectively, and `nodes` is an empty list. The function returns a value based on the manipulation of these lists, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
