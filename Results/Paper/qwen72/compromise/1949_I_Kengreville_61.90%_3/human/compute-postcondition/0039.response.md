The code snippet initializes the `nodes` list to an empty list. This does not affect the other variables, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` is now an empty list. `coef0[i]` is now 0, `coef1[i]` is now 1. `c0` and `c1` remain unchanged, and `ok` remains `False`.**
