Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, and if `i` (which is 2) was not visited, `visited[2]` is set to `True`. `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, and if `i` was not visited, `coef0[2]` is also set to 0. `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, and if `i` was not visited, `coef1[2]` is also set to 1. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and if `i` was not visited, `c0` remains unchanged. `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and if `i` was not visited, `c1` is increased by 2. `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`. `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements, and if `i` was not visited, `nodes` remains unchanged.***
