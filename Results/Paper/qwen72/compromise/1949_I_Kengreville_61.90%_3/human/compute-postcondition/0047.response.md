Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is `coef0[j]` + `coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j]`, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain at least two elements. `j` is the second element in `nodes`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` updates the value of `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it.
- `c0` was initially `coef0[j]`.
- After the execution, `c0` becomes `coef0[j]` + `coef0[j]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
