Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n` with `visited[2]` being `True`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` and `coef0[2]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` and `coef1[2]` being 1, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes` plus 2, `ok` is `False`, `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- **`i`**: Remains 2.
- **`x`, `y`, `r`**: These lists remain unchanged, with each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) still holding the values of three integers input by the user.
- **`visited`**: Remains `[False] * n` with `visited[2]` being `True`.
- **`coef0`**: Remains `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` and `coef0[2]` being 0.
- **`coef1`**: Remains `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` and `coef1[2]` being 1.
- **`c0`**: After all iterations, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.
- **`c1`**: After all iterations, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes` plus 2 (since `c1` starts at 1 and `coef1[2]` is 1, adding 1 initially and then summing the rest).
- **`ok`**: Remains `False`.
- **`nodes`**: Can contain any number of elements, but the loop will have executed for each element in `nodes`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
