The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the input. It then checks the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's, it prints 'YES'; if there are more than 2 '1's and the count is even, it prints 'YES'; if there are exactly 2 '1's and they are not adjacent, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without making any changes to external variables or the directory structure.
