Output State: **The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and during each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the input. It then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. After `t` iterations, the loop completes, and no further changes are made to any variables.**
