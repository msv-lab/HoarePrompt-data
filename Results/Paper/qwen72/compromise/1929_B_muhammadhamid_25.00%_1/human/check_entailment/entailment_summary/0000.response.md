### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the size of the grid and the number of diagonals that must have at least one colored cell.

2. **Special Case for `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` is 1, the function prints 1. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to have a colored cell, coloring one cell is sufficient.

3. **Case for `k <= 2 * n`:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - This is correct because in a grid of size `n`, there are `2 * n` diagonals that can be covered by coloring cells along the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, so the minimum number of cells needed is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

4. **Case for `k > 2 * n`:**
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - This is correct because after covering `2 * n` diagonals with `n` cells, the remaining diagonals need to be covered. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, so the number of additional cells needed is `k - 2 * n` divided by 2, plus the `n` cells already used. This simplifies to `k // 2 + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `2 * n` by printing `n` (which is `math.ceil(2 * n / 2)`).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `2 * n` by ensuring the correct number of additional cells is added.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct number of cells for each test case, as verified by the provided example and the execution summary.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases, and the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to be colored is sound.
