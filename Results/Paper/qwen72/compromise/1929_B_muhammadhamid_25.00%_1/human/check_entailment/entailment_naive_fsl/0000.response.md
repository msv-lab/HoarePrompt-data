Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when `k` is exactly `2 * n`. According to the problem description, if `k` is `2 * n`, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is `n`. However, the program incorrectly prints `n` for `k` values greater than `2 * n` but less than or equal to `4 * n - 2`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 6
```
The expected output should be `3` because `k = 6` and `2 * n = 6`, so we need to color `n = 3` cells. However, the program outputs `4` because it uses `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which is `4` for `k = 6`.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly handle the edge case where `k` is exactly `2 * n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
