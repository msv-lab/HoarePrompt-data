Output State: **a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, 1 <= k <= m, each element in a and b is an integer such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6, good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the list b, window_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of the list a, matches is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in window_freq and b_freq.**

Explanation:
- The variable `matches` is calculated by summing the minimum frequency of each integer that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `good_subarrays`, `b_freq`, `window_freq`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a` and the corresponding frequencies in `b`.
