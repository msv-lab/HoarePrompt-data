Output State: **a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, 1 <= k <= m, each element in a and b is an integer such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6, good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the list b, and window_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of the list a.**
