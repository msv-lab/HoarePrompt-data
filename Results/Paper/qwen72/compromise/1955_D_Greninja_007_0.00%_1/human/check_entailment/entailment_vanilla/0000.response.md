Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split(' '))` to parse the integers.

2. **Frequency Counters**: The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in both arrays `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements). This is a good approach because it allows efficient counting and comparison of elements.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**: The initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and `b` is calculated using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. This correctly counts the minimum number of common elements between the two frequency counters.

4. **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the second element to the `(n-m+1)`-th element. For each new position of the window:
   - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`).
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
   - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program performs one last check to see if the final window is good. This is necessary because the loop only checks up to the second-to-last window.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

The logic and implementation of the program are correct and efficiently handle the problem constraints. The use of the `Counter` class and the sliding window technique ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.

Correctness: **True**
