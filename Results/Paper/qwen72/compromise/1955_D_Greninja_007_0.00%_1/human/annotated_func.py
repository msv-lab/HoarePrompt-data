#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, and 1 <= k <= m. Each element in a and b is an integer such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in

    #State: `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, 1 <= k <= m, each element in `a` and `b` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of the list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the number of good subarrays, which is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the subarray and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `k` (an integer), `n` (the length of list `a`), and `m` (the length of list `b`). It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the subarray and the corresponding integer in `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the function concludes, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the variables `b_freq` and `window_freq` contain the frequency counts of elements in `b` and the last `m` elements of `a`, respectively. The variable `matches` holds the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq`. The final state of the program includes the updated count of good subarrays in the variable `good_subarrays`.
