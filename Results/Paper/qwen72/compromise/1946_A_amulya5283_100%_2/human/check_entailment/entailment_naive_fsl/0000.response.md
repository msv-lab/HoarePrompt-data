Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Specifically, the program increments the result (`res`) for every element that is equal to the median, but this does not necessarily reflect the correct number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 2
```
- The original array is `[1, 2, 2]`.
- The sorted array is `[1, 2, 2]`.
- The median is `2` (at index `1`).

According to the program:
- `mdx` is `1` (correctly calculated).
- The program will iterate over the elements from `mdx` to `n-1` (i.e., from index `1` to `2`).
- Both elements at indices `1` and `2` are equal to the median `2`, so `res` will be incremented twice.
- The program will output `2`.

However, the correct output should be `1` because:
- You only need to increase the element at index `0` (which is `1`) by `1` to make the array `[2, 2, 2]`.
- The median of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`, which is the same as the original median, but the next possible median is `3` after one more operation.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle this case and outputs an incorrect result.
