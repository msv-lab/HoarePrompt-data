Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median Index**:
   - The program calculates the median index as `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is incorrect for even-length arrays. For an even-length array, the median is the element at index `n // 2 - 1` in the sorted array, not `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of elements equal to the current median and adds this count to the result. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual number of operations needed to increase the median.
   - The correct approach is to find the smallest element greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this element.

3. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing `1`, as the median of a single-element array can only be increased by one operation.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the current median.
3. Find the smallest element greater than the current median.
4. Calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this smallest element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            next_greater = current_median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] == current_median:
                mdx += 1
            if mdx < n:
                operations = (a[mdx] - current_median) * (n // 2 + n % 2)
            else:
                operations = 1
            print(operations)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting the Array**: `a.sort()`
- **Finding the Current Median**: `current_median = a[mdx]` where `mdx = n // 2`
- **Finding the Next Greater Element**: Increment `mdx` until `a[mdx]` is greater than `current_median`.
- **Calculating Operations**: If a greater element is found, calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this element. If no greater element is found, the minimum number of operations is 1.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
