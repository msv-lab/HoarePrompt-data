Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers from the user. It sorts the array `a` and then calculates the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the array that are equal to the element at the middle index. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and all test cases have been processed. **
