Output State: **`t` is 0, and all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` was an input integer, `a` was a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` was set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` was the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. If `n` was 1, the function printed 1. If `n` was greater than 1, the function printed the value of `res`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the function took an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` as input, sorted the list, and then calculated the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the list that are equal to the element at the middle index. If the list had only one element, the function printed 1. If the list had more than one element, the function printed the count of elements from the middle index to the end that matched the middle element.
