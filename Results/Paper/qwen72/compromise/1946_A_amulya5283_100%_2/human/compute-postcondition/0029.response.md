Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: This is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0. This implies that `t` is a positive integer that has been decremented by 1.
2. **`n`**: This is an input integer provided by the user.
3. **`a`**: This is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
4. **`mdx`**: This is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula determines the middle index of the list `a` for odd and even lengths:
   - If `n` is odd, `mdx` will be the index of the middle element.
   - If `n` is even, `mdx` will be the index of the first element in the second half of the list.
5. **`i`**: This is equal to `n`.
6. **`res`**: This is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **1**
