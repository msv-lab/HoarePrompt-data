To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is `mdx`.
   - `res` is 0. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n)`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute.

4. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`.
   - `n` must still be at least `mdx + 1` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is 0. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1.**
