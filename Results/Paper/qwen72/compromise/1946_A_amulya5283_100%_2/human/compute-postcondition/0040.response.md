Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and is still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `res` is 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, otherwise `res` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by 1.
- If the element at index `mdx` in `a` was equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, `res` was initially 1 and is now 2.
- If the element at index `mdx` in `a` was not equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, `res` was initially 0 and is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i` remain unchanged.
