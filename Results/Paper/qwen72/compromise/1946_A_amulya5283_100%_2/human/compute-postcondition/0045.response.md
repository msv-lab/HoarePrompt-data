The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. If `n` is 1, the postcondition is as described. If `n` is greater than 1, `t` is the previous value of `t` minus the number of iterations and is still greater than 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to `mdx`.**
