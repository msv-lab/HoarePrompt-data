Output State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`. `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = mdx` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the element at index `mdx` (i.e., `a[mdx]`) is equal to the element at the current index `i` (i.e., `a[i]`).
- If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, the variable `res` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1`).
- The final value of `res` will be the count of elements in the array `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
