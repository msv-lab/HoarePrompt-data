Postcondition: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` starts at `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**
