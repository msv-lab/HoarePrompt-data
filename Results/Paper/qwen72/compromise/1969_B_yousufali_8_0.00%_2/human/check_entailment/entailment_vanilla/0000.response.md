### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).
   - The string is sorted if all 0s come before all 1s.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string and converts it to a list of integers.
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count the number of 1s encountered so far.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is 1, it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` uses `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. `split()` is used to split a string by whitespace, but a binary string does not contain spaces. Instead, it should use `input().strip()` to read the string and convert it to a list of integers using a list comprehension or a similar method.
   - **Logic in `func_1`:**
     - The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The function adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a 0 after a 1. This does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts.
     - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all 1s to the end of the string. This can be done by finding the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 0s, and then calculating the cost based on the length of the remaining substring that needs to be shifted.

4. **Correcting the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - Read the binary string correctly.
     - Calculate the minimum cost to sort the string by finding the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 0s.
     - The cost is the length of the string minus the length of the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 0s.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    prefix_ones = 0
    suffix_zeros = 0
    
    # Find the longest prefix of 1s
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            prefix_ones += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Find the longest suffix of 0s
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            suffix_zeros += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # The cost is the length of the string minus the length of the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 0s
    ans = n - prefix_ones - suffix_zeros
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the input handling and the logic for calculating the cost.
- The corrected program correctly reads the binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.

**Correctness: False**
