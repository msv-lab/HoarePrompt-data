You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.

    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, `a` remains the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` remains the integer division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when the list is traversed in reverse, but each element is counted at most once. `s_a` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and `s_b` is the sum of the elements in `nums` (since both `s_a` and `s_b` will have summed the entire list after the loop).
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` (`a`) plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2 (`b`), where each element is counted at most once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns either `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, or it returns the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the sum of the first `a` elements and the sum of the last `b` elements, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2. Each element is counted at most once in this sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic of the Kraken's attacks. Specifically, it does not simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the first and last ships alternately and removing the ships that have sunk. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a different value because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the removal of sunk ships.

The program calculates the sum of the first `math.ceil(k / 2)` and the last `k // 2` elements of the list, but this does not accurately reflect the process of the Kraken's attacks. The correct approach should involve simulating the attacks step by step, removing ships that have sunk, and continuing the attacks until the Kraken has attacked `k` times or all ships have sunk.
