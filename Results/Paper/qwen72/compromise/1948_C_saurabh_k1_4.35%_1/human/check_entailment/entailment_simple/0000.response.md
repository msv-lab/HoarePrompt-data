### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) on a 2xN grid with arrows pointing left or right. The program's logic is based on the following steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns).
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is '<'.
   - If `b[n-2]` is '<', it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Decision Logic:**
  - The robot starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, n).
  - The robot moves every second, and each move is followed by a move along the arrow in the current cell.
  - The key to reaching (2, n) is to ensure that the robot can move to the last column of the second row.
  - If `b[n-2]` is '<', it means the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row points to the left. This would prevent the robot from moving to the last cell (2, n) because the robot would be forced to move left instead of right.
  - Conversely, if `b[n-2]` is '>', the robot can move to the last cell (2, n) from the second-to-last cell (2, n-1).

- **Edge Cases and General Validity:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2. In this case, `b[n-2]` is `b[0]`, which is the first cell of the second row. If `b[0]` is '<', the robot cannot move to (2, 2) from (2, 1).
  - The program does not consider the arrows in the first row (`a`), but this is not necessary because the robot can always move to the second row from the first row. The critical factor is the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. It correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
