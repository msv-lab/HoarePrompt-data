Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) contains a '<' arrow. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><>>
><>>
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and can follow the path:
1. (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (initial move to the right)
2. (1, 2) -> (1, 1) (move along the '<' arrow)
3. (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (initial move to the right again)
4. (1, 2) -> (1, 3) (move along the '>' arrow)
5. (1, 3) -> (1, 4) (initial move to the right)
6. (1, 4) -> (2, 4) (move along the '>' arrow)

The robot can reach (2, 4), but the program will incorrectly output 'No' because `b[n - 2]` is '<'. This is a case where the program does not work correctly.
