Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n, and two lists of strings a and b, each of length n. After processing, it prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in b is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables t, a, and b are not retained between iterations, and their values are reset with each new iteration.**
