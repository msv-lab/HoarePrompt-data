The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of two strings. `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even, representing the length of the strings. The list of two strings contains only the characters '<' and '>', and each string is of length `n`, representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the number of pairs of arrows (one from each row) that point towards each other, for each test case.
