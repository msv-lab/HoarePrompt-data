Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. The template `t` must have the property that for each position `i`:
   - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must equal `t[i]`.
   - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must differ from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns 'YES' because it is possible to construct a template where `t[i]` is uppercase and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for all positions.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is sufficient to determine if a valid template can be constructed.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required by the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of `func_1`:
- The function only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. This is necessary because if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, no single template can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

To fix this, `func_1` should also check if `a[i]` equals `b[i]` before returning 'YES'.

Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

Given the original implementation, the program is **incorrect** because it does not ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same when checking for a valid template.

Correctness: **False**
