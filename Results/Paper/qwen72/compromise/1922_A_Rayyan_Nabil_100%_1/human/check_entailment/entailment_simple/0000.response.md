### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if for each index `i`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function iterates over each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` at the same index.
   - If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly identifies if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. This is a necessary condition for the template to exist.
   - However, the function does not explicitly construct the template `t`. Instead, it relies on the fact that if such a position exists, a valid template can be constructed where the corresponding character in `t` is the uppercase version of `c[i]` at that position.
   - This approach is valid because if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can always choose an uppercase character for `t[i]` that is different from `c[i]` and ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template while `c[i]` does not.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the inputs as specified and calls `func_1` with the correct arguments.
   - It stores the results and prints them as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is sound and ensures that the conditions for the template are met. The handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` is also correct.

**Correctness: True**
