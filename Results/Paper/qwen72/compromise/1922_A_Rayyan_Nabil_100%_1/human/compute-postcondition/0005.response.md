To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This means `results` is guaranteed to have at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, the state of `result` is not explicitly defined before the loop starts. In the context of the loop, `result` will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` is a list with at least one element and that `result` is the first element of `results` before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is the same input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the first element of `results`**
