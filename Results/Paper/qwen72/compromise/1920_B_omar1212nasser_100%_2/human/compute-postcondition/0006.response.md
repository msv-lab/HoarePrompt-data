Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the results of the expression `s - 2 * s2` calculated after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements plus the sum of the `negatives` elements that are `removals` positions before the end of the list.**
