Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array contains negative numbers. According to the problem description, Alice can remove at most `k` elements to maximize the sum, and Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum. However, the current implementation only considers the smallest elements for removal and the largest elements for negation, which may not always be the optimal strategy when negative numbers are involved.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5 1 1
-1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, Alice should remove the negative number `-1` to maximize the sum, and Bob should not negate any number since the sum is already maximized by Alice's removal. The expected output should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`. However, the current program will output a different result because it does not handle negative numbers correctly.

To fix this, the program should consider the negative numbers and their impact on the sum when deciding which elements to remove and which to negate.
