Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program is removing the largest elements (from the end of the sorted list) in the loop where it updates `s` and `s2`.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The program is not correctly identifying the smallest elements to multiply by -1 after Alice's removals.

3. **Handling of Negatives**: The program is subtracting twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements from the total sum, which is not the optimal strategy. It should consider the smallest elements after Alice's removals.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the number of elements to remove or negate is equal to the number of elements in the array.

To correct the program, Alice should remove the smallest elements, and Bob should negate the smallest elements after Alice's removals. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Calculate the initial sum after Alice's removals
    s = sum(elements)
    
    # Bob negates the smallest elements
    negated_sum = sum(elements[:negatives])
    
    # Calculate the final sum after Bob's negations
    final_sum = s - 2 * negated_sum
    
    return final_sum
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the smallest remaining elements, which aligns with the optimal strategies for both players.
