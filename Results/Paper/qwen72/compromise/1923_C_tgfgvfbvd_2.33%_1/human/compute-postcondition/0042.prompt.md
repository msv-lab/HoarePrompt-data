Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is adjusted to be the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a-2]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b-1`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, either the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b-1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than twice the length of the subarray.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, which is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
