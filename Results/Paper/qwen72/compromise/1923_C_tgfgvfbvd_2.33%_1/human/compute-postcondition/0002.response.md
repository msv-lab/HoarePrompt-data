The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `l`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input.**
