To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^4.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1.
   - `x` is the last element in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
   - `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is adjusted to be the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions. This is because the `print` statement itself does not depend on any conditional logic; it simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
