To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **User Input and List Initialization:**
   - `n` and `m` are updated to values provided by the user.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `x` is the last element in `l`.

2. **Additional User Input:**
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.

4. **Condition for Updating `s`:**
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`.

5. **Subarray Length and Value Condition:**
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` in `l` is greater than 1.
   - The value of `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and must be true for the code to reach the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
