The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the second element in `l`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, `c` is the first element in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the second element in `l`.**
