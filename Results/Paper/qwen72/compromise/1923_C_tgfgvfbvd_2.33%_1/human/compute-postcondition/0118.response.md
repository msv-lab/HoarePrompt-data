Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `x` is the last element in `l`.
- `m` is now `m - 1`.
- `s` is now `p[b - 1]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
