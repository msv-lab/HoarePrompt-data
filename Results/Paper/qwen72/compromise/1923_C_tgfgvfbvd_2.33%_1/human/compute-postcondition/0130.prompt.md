Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed). For each iteration, `a` and `b` were integers provided by user input. The value of `s` was calculated as the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, adjusted by subtracting `p[a-2]` if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` was checked, and 'YES' was printed if the condition was met; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. For each iteration, if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met and "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input for the last iteration, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input initially, `l` remains the list of integers read from input, `p` remains the list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` remains the last element in `l`, `m` is now 0, and `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` for the last iteration. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` for the last iteration. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` in `l` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray, the condition within the if part is met for the last iteration. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met for the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
