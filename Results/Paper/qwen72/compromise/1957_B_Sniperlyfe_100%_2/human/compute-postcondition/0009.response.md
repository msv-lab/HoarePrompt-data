Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The remaining elements of `nums` are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. If `k` is 0 after the first element is set, the remaining elements of `nums` are all 0. **
