The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The remaining elements of the list are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. If `k` is 0, the remaining elements of `nums` are all 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The remaining elements are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. If `k` is 0, the remaining elements are all 0.**
