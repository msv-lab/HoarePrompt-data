Output State: **The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. Since `k` is 0, the remaining elements of `nums` are all 0.**

Explanation:
- The first element of `nums` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). Given that `k` is 0, `k.bit_length()` is 1, so \(2^{1 - 1} - 1 = 2^0 - 1 = 0\). Therefore, `nums[0]` is 0.
- The remaining elements of `nums` are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. Since `k` is 0, the remaining elements are all 0.
- The program returns the list `nums` as described.
