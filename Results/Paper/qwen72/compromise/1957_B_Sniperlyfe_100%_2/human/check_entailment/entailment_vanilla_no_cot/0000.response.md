Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of `n` zeros.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using the expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which creates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` to update the remaining sum.

3. **Distributing the Remaining Sum**:
   - The program iterates through the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` to each element.
   - This ensures that the sum of the sequence remains `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - If there is any remaining sum `k` after distributing to the other elements, it adds this remaining sum to the first element `nums[0]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for each test case and prints them.

This approach ensures that the conditions are met:
- The sum of the sequence equals `k`.
- The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program correctly constructs the sequence and handles the test cases as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
