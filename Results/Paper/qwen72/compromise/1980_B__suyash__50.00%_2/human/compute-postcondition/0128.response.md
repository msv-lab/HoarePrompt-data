Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
2. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `a` and converting each part to an integer.
3. `n` is the first integer in the list `b`.
4. `f` is the second integer in the list `b`.
5. `i` is `len(l)`, where `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order.
6. `k` is the third integer in the list `b`.
7. `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order.
8. `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the list `o`.
9. `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from the list `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in the list `o`.
10. `t` must be greater than `len(l)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will simply print the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
