Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is equal to `t`, `k` is now equal to `b[2]`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is the second integer in the list `b`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of a loop. Since the loop has already completed all iterations, the `continue` statement has no effect, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
