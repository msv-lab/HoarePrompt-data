Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of unique strings that must have at least 3 elements.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Output:
**YES**
