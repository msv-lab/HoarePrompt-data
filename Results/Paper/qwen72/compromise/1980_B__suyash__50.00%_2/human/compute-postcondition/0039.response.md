Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `k` is `k - dic[l[1]]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Output:
**NO**
