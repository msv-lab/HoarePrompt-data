Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` that must have at least 1 element, `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, and `k` is `k - dic[l[0]]`. If `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
