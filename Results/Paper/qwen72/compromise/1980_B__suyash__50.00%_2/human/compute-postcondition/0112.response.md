Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]` but the loop or if statement continues.***
