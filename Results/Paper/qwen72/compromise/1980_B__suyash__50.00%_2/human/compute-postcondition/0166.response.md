Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and sorted in descending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the string at index `f - 1` in `o`. If `fav` (the string at index `f - 1` in `o`) is not equal to the string at index `i` in `l`, then `k` is further reduced by the count of the string at index `i` in `l`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to the string at index `i` in `l`, `k` remains the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the string at index `f - 1` in `o` minus the count of the string at index 1 in `l`. In this case, if `k` is less than 0 or `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
