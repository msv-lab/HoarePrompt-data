To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the initial state provided.

**Initial State:**
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or `x // n`, whichever is applicable.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Determine the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`:**
   - We need to find the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides `x` without leaving a remainder and `d <= n`.
2. **If no such divisor exists, use `x // n`:**
   - If there is no divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, then `ans` will be the integer division of `x` by `n`, i.e., `x // n`.

**Explanation:**
- The value of `ans` will be the largest integer `d` that satisfies both `d <= n` and `x % d == 0`. If no such `d` exists, `ans` will be `x // n`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the value of `ans` as described.

**Output:**
**ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n, or x // n if no such divisor exists)**
