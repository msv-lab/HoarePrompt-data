### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum GCD (balance) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The balance is the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides `x` and `x // d` is at least `n`.
   - This is because if `d` is a divisor of `x`, then we can create `x // d` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`.
   - If `x // d` is at least `n`, then we can use `d` as the difficulty for all `n` sub-problems, and the GCD will be `d`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive) using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n <= i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems is at least `n`.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` optimizes the search for divisors by only iterating up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The code correctly updates `ans` to the maximum possible GCD that satisfies the conditions.

5. **Validation with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or `x // n`, whichever is applicable.
   - This aligns with the problem's requirement to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `x` by correctly setting `ans` to 1 (since the only way to split `x` into `x` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1).
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 by correctly setting `ans` to `x` (since the GCD of a single problem with difficulty `x` is `x`).
