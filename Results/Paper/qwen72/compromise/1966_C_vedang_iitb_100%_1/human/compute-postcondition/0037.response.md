The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mexsize` could be 1 or 2 depending on the value of `sz`. If `sz` is 1, `mexsize` was initially 2, so it becomes 3. If `sz` is not 1, `mexsize` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the third element of the list `a`. If `sz` is 1, then `mexsize` is 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` is 2.**
