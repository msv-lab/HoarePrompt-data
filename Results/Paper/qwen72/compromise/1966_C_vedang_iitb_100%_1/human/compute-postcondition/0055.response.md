The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in the list `a` after the current `sz`.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the first element of `a`, and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements. The next `sz` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the second element of `a`. If `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2.**
