Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a` plus `k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is 0, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k % 2` since `i` is 1.
- The values of `ii`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
