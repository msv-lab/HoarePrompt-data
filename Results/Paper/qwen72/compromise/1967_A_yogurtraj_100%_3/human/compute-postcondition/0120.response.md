Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is reduced by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is equal to `a[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`. Therefore, `r` is now equal to `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
