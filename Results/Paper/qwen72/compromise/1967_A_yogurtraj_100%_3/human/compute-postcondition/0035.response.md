Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[2]`, `k` is 0, and `rem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `rem` is 0, and `r` is the fourth element of `a`.***
