To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks.
   - `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks.
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `r` is determined by either the last element of `a` or the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks. Since `k` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` will always be 0. Therefore, `r` will be the last element of `a` or `a[i]` depending on the loop condition.
   - `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`. Since `k` is 0, `rem` will always be 0.
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it is determined by the loop condition.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `rem` is 0.
     - `y` is `n - 1 - i`.
     - The expression simplifies to: \((r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + (n - 1 - i)\).

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - \((r - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1 - i)\)
   - \((r - 1) * n + n - i\)
   - \(r * n - n + n - i\)
   - \(r * n - i\)

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output will be \(r * n - i\), where `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i]` (depending on the loop condition), and `i` is the index at which the loop breaks.

Output: **\(r * n - i\) (where \(r\) is the last element of `a` or `a[i]` and \(i\) is the index at which the loop breaks)**
