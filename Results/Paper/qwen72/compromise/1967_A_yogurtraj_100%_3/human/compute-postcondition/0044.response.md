The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, and `k` remains not 0. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.**
