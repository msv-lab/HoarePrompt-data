Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, and `y` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`, and `y` is 0.***
