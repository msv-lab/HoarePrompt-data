Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is 0, `i` is 0. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, and `y` is 0.***
