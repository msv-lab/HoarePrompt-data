Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[3]` to `r` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
