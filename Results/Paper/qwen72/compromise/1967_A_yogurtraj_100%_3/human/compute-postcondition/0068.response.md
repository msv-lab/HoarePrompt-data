Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to the third element of the list `a` because `i` is 1 and `i + 1` is 2.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `r` was the second element of `a`, but now it is updated to the third element of `a`.
