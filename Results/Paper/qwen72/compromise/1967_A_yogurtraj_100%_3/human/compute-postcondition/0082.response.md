To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ii` is 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks.
- `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks.
- `k` is a non-zero value or the remaining value of `k` after the loop completes.
- `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Understanding `k % n`**:
   - `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` can be expanded as:
     - `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`
     - Simplifying further:
       - `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`
       - `a[n - 1] * n + (k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`
       - `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`
       - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k % n`
       - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + (k % n)`

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression simplifies to:
     - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + (k % n)`
     - This can be further simplified to:
     - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k % n`
     - Since `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, it can be expressed as `k - n * (k // n)`.
     - Therefore, the expression becomes:
     - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + (k - n * (k // n))`
     - Simplifying further:
     - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k - n * (k // n)`
     - `a[n - 1] * n + 2 * k + 1 - n - n * (k // n)`
     - `a[n - 1] * n + 2 * k + 1 - n - k`
     - `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n`

### Final Output:
The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` simplifies to `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n`.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n (where `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `k` is the remaining value of `k` after the loop completes, and `n` is the input integer greater than 1)**
