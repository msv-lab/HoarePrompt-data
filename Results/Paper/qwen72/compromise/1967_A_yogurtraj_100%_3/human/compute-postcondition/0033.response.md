Output State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `rem` is 0, `r` is the third element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it.
- Given `i` is 2, `(i + 1)` is 3.
- The expression `(a[i + 1] - a[i])` calculates the difference between the fourth element and the third element of the list `a`.
- Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- The value of `rem` is set to 0, and `r` is set to the third element of `a` (which is `a[2]`).
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged.
