Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `y` is 0, `r` is updated to `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[2]` because `i` is 1, and `i + 1` equals 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
