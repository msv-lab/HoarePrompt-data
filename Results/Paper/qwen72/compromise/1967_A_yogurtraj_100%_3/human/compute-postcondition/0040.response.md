Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.**
