To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step:

### Initial State:
- `ii` is 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks.
- `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks.
- `k` is 0 or the remaining value of `k` after the loop completes.
- `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks.
- `k` is 0.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is either the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks.
   - Since `k` is 0 at the point where the loop breaks, `k // (i + 1)` is 0.
   - Therefore, `r` is simply `a[i]` at the point where the loop breaks.

2. **Determine `rem`**:
   - `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks.
   - Since `k` is 0 at the point where the loop breaks, `rem` is 0.

3. **Determine `y`**:
   - `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks.
   - The value of `y` depends on the value of `i` at the point where the loop breaks.

4. **Determine the Expression**:
   - The expression to print is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `rem` is 0.
     - `r` is `a[i]`.
     - `y` is `n - 1 - i` or 0.
   - The expression simplifies to: `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + y`.

### Final Output:
- If `y` is 0, the expression becomes: `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1`.
- If `y` is `n - 1 - i`, the expression becomes: `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1 - i)`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the point where the loop breaks is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + y (where a[i] is the value of the element in the sorted list `a` at the index `i` where the loop breaks, and y is either 0 or n - 1 - i)**
