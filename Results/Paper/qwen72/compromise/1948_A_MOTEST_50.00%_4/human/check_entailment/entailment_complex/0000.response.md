Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `n` for the current test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1. According to the problem, if `n` is 1, there is no string that can satisfy the condition of having exactly one special character (since a special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot have both neighbors). Therefore, the program prints 'NO' for `n = 1`, which is correct.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string `ans` by repeating each of the first `n // 2` letters of the uppercase English alphabet twice. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and the total number of special characters is `n`.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts the string `ans` with 'AAA' and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet twice. This also ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` for valid `n` values, and 'NO' for `n = 1`. This matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case of `n = 1` correctly and ensures that the string length does not exceed 200 for any valid `n` (since the maximum `n` is 50, the maximum length of `ans` would be 100 for even `n` and 102 for odd `n`).

6. **Console Clearing**: The `os.system('cls')` command is used to clear the console screen. While this is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, it does not affect the logic of the program and is a common practice in some environments.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
