The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The state of `suff` and `ans` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is 0; `ans` is set to positive infinity; `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
