Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the case where Kirill is already in a position that satisfies the condition (i.e., he is among the first `m` people in the line). In such a case, the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend should be 0, but the program does not account for this scenario.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
2 3
1 1
```
Here, Kirill is already in the last position, and `m` is 2, meaning he is already among the first 2 people in the line. Therefore, he should not need to spend any coins. However, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if Kirill is already in a position that satisfies the condition and return 0 if that is the case.
