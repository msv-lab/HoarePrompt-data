### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **List `c` Creation**:
   - The list `c` is created such that each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct because it ensures that Kirill will always choose the cheaper option to bribe a person.

4. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The list `suff` is initialized to store the suffix sums of `c`.
   - The suffix sum is calculated in reverse order, which is correct. `suff[i]` will store the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.

5. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to ensure that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost for Kirill to move to each of these positions. The cost is `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which is the cost to bribe the person at position `i` plus the cost to bribe all the people between `i` and `n-1`.
   - The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of the program is sound. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any of the first `k` positions.
- The suffix sum calculation ensures that the total cost of bribing all the people between the current position and the end of the queue is considered.
- The program handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
