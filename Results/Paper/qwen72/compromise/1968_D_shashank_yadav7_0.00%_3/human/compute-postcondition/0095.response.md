Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the initial value of `n`.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.
- `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`.
- `b` and `s` are both the result of applying the function `p` to their respective values `n` times.
- `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- The loop breaks if `k` reaches 0 before completing.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state and the variables described in it do not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
