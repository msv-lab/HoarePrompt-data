Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer minus 1, `s` is the fourth input integer minus 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than `n + 1`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
