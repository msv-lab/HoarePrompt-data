Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `s` is the fourth input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than `n + 1`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list `p`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `t`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged. The new list `p` is now available for use in the program.
