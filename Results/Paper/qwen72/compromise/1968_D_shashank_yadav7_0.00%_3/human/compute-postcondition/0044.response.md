Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Set to `n - 1`, where `n` is another input integer.
3. **`n`**: An input integer.
4. **`k`**: Initially set to `k - n`, where `k` is an input integer.
5. **`b`**: The result of `n` applications of the function `p[b] - 1`.
6. **`s`**: The result of `n` applications of the function `p[s] - 1`.
7. **`p`**: A list of integers provided by the user.
8. **`a`**: A list of integers provided by the user.
9. **`sp`**: The sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`.
10. **`bp`**: The sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`.
11. **`bm`**: The sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration.
12. **`sm`**: The sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration.
13. **Loop Condition**: If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both set to 0, and the loop breaks.
14. **Final Condition**: `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state describes a complex set of operations and conditions, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly.
- The final condition that `bm` is greater than `sm` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
