Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is now `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(0, a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] * k + bp)`, `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `sm` is less than `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, otherwise `sm` remains unchanged, `sp` is now `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`, and `bm` is now `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
