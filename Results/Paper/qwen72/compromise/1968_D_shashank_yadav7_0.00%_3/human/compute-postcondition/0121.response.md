Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, `k` is set to -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b` is now `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp)` if `bm` is less than `a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp`, otherwise `bm` remains unchanged. `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `sm` is less than `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, otherwise `sm` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)`.
- If `sm` is less than `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, then `sm` becomes `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`.
- If `sm` is greater than or equal to `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, then `sm` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, and `bm` remain as described in the initial state.
