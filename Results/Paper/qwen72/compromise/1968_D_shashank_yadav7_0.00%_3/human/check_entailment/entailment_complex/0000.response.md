Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in how it calculates the scores of Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines where `bm` and `sm` are updated:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

These lines are incorrect because they are not properly simulating the game's rules. According to the game rules, on each turn, the player's score increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`, and then they either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`. The current implementation incorrectly adds the maximum of the current score and a product of the current position value and the remaining turns, which does not align with the game's rules.

The correct approach should be to simply add the value at the current position to the player's score and then move to the next position as specified by the permutation `p`.

Additionally, the loop should run exactly `k` times, not `n` times, and the `k -= 1` should be outside the loop to ensure the correct number of turns.

Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1  # Adjust to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Adjust to 0-indexed
        
        bp = 0  # Bodya's score
        sp = 0  # Sasha's score
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]  # Add current position value to Bodya's score
            sp += a[s]  # Add current position value to Sasha's score
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move Bodya to the next position
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move Sasha to the next position
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

Given the original program's logic, it is clear that the scores are not being calculated correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
