Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `l`. It returns the LCM of the elements in `l`. The function does not update any external list `a` or variable `sumo` as described in the annotations; these are not part of the actual function's behavior. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the LCM of the elements in `l` is returned. **
