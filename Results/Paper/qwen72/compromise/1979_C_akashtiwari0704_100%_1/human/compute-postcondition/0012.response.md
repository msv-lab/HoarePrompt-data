Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. The input list `l` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`, and `t` and `T` remain as they were before the function call. **
