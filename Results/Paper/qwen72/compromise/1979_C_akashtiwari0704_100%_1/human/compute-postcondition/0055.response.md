Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
