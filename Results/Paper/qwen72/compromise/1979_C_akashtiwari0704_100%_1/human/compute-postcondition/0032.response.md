The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `T` is 0 (unchanged)
- `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step (unchanged)
- `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]` (unchanged)
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a` (unchanged)
- `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation (unchanged)
- `sumo` is less than `prod` (unchanged)
- `ans` is an empty string (changed)

Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is converted to a string and appended to `ans` followed by a space. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' '`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' '`**
