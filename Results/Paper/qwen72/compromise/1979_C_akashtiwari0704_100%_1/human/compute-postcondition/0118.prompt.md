Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. For each test case, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20` for all `1 <= i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, and `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`bets` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current state remains as described. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the current state also remains as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
