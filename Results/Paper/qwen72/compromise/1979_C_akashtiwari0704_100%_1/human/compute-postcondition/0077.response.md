Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `bets` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is `bets - 1`.
3. `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
4. `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values.
5. `sumo` is less than `prod`.
6. `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.

### Analysis:
1. **`bets`**: This is a positive integer, indicating the number of elements in the list `a`.
2. **`i`**: This is the index of the last element in the list `a`, which is `bets - 1`.
3. **`a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**: This means each element in the list `a` is updated to the integer division of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]`.
4. **`sumo`**: This is the sum of all the updated values in the list `a`.
5. **`sumo` is less than `prod`**: This is a condition that must be true after the updates.
6. **`ans`**: This is a string that contains the updated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`, each followed by a space.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `bets` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `prod` is an integer.

2. **Update `a[i]`**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - This means each element in `a` is replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]`.

3. **Calculate `sumo`**:
   - `sumo` is the sum of all the updated values in the list `a`.
   - Since `sumo` is less than `prod`, the sum of the updated values must be less than `prod`.

4. **Form `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a string that contains the updated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`, each followed by a space.
   - The format of `ans` will be a space-separated string of the updated values.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which contains the updated values of the list `a` each followed by a space. The values in `a` are updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.

Output: **a[0] a[1] ... a[bets - 1] (where each a[i] is updated to prod // a[i] and the sum of all updated a[i] values is less than prod)**
