Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[0]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`, which has been updated to `prod // a[0]` in the initial state. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.
