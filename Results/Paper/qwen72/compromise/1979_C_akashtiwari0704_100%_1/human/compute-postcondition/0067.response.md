Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bets` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values.
   - The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `bets`, `i`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is `-1`.

Output: **-1**
