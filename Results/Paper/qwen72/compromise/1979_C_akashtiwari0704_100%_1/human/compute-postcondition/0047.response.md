Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is `bets + 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 2` elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `i`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is not affected by the code snippet provided, and its condition (`sumo` is less than `prod`) remains the same.
