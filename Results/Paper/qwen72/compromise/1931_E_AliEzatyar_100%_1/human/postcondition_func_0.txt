The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list. The length of `num` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify the elements of the list. If the list contains no trailing zeros, the function returns 0. If the list is entirely composed of zeros, the function returns the length of the list.
