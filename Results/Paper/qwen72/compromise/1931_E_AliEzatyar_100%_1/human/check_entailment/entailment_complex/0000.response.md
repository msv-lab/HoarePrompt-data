### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of the string representations of the integers. This is correct because the number of digits in an integer is equivalent to the length of its string representation.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. However, the function is called with `item` which is a string, and the function itself is designed to work with strings, not lists of integers. This part is correct in terms of the function's usage and purpose.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program then collects the number of trailing zeros for each integer in the list and sorts them in descending order.
   - It subtracts the sum of every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros from the total number of digits. This is intended to simulate the optimal play where Anna and Sasha would try to maximize or minimize the number of trailing zeros, respectively.
   - The program checks if the resulting number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Usage:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly used to count trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. However, the function name `func_1` is not very descriptive, and it might be better to name it something like `count_trailing_zeros`.

- **Logic for Trailing Zeros:**
  - The logic for subtracting the sum of every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros is not entirely clear. It seems to be an attempt to simulate the optimal play, but it is not well-documented or explained. This could lead to confusion.

- **Optimal Play Simulation:**
  - The program assumes that the optimal play involves minimizing the number of trailing zeros, which is a reasonable strategy but not explicitly proven. The logic for determining the winner based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros is not straightforward and might need more explanation.

### Conclusion:
Despite the issues with the function name and the lack of clear documentation for the logic, the program appears to follow the rules of the game and the optimal play strategy. The core logic of counting digits and trailing zeros, and then determining the winner based on the total number of digits, seems to be implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

However, for better clarity and maintainability, it would be beneficial to:
- Rename `func_1` to a more descriptive name.
- Add comments to explain the logic behind the optimal play strategy.
- Ensure that the function and variable names are consistent and clear.
