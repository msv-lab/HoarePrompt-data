### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test` and initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (the number of integers in the list and the threshold for Sasha's win).
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and converts them to strings to facilitate digit manipulation.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `total_digits`.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using the function `func_1` and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of digits that can be subtracted by pairing the trailing zeros. This is done by summing every second element in the `zeros` list starting from the first element.
   - The program checks if the remaining number of digits after subtracting the paired trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the remaining number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - It iterates from the last character to the first, incrementing a counter for each '0' encountered until a non-zero character is found.

### Issues:
- **Data Type Mismatch**:
  - The program reads the list of integers as strings, which is necessary for counting digits and trailing zeros. However, the function `func_1` is called with a string, but the function is designed to work with a list of characters. This is a mismatch that needs to be corrected.
  - The function `func_1` should be called with a string, not a list.

- **Logical Error**:
  - The program calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros correctly.
  - However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs, but this does not accurately reflect the game's rules. Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, and the goal is to determine if the final concatenated number can be greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

### Corrected Logic:
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Anna's move does not change the total number of digits in the list.
  - Sasha's move reduces the list by one element but can potentially increase the number of digits in the final number.
  - The key is to determine if the total number of digits in the list can be made to exceed \(m\) by Sasha's concatenation moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
    
    # If the total number of digits is already greater than or equal to m + 1, Sasha wins
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in how it determines the winner.
- The corrected program correctly checks if the total number of digits in the list can be made to exceed \(m\) by Sasha's concatenation moves, which is the key to determining the winner.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
