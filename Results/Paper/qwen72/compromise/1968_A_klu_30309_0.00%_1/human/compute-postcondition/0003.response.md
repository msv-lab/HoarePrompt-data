Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, y is not defined, max_val is the largest divisor of x that is less than x and greater than 1, and the function has returned a value if a divisor y satisfying 2 * y >= x was found, otherwise max_val remains 1 and the function has not returned a value.**.
