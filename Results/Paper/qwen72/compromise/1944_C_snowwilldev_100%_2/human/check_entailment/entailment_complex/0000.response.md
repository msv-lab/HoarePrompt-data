Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. However, the program has a few issues:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it should be designed to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as parameters.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program only processes one test case at a time. It should be able to handle multiple test cases in a loop, as indicated by the first line of input which specifies the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The function's logic does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. The function returns the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where the count of `i` in `a` is 0 or where there are at least two unique integers in `a` that appear exactly once. This logic does not align with the optimal strategy for maximizing or minimizing the MEX.

4. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation should be based on the final state of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The current logic does not ensure that the array `c` is constructed in a way that reflects the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
