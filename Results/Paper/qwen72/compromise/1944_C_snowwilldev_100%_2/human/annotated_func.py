#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `t`, `test_cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each integer in the list `a` after the loop has finished executing. The keys in `cnt` will be the unique integers from `a`, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `N` will remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. If no such `i` is found, `t` will be the count of unique integers in `cnt` that appear exactly once, and the loop will return `N + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return a list of results for multiple test cases as described in the annotations. Instead, it reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list `a` of `N` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function returns the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where the count of `i` in `a` is 0 or where there are at least two unique integers in `a` that appear exactly once. If no such `i` is found within the range, it returns `N + 1`.
