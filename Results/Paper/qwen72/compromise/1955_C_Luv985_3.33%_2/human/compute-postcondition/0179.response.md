Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `r` is `n - 1`.
- The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements `r` by 1.
- Therefore, `r` becomes `n - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
