Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, and the value of `a[1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0. Additionally, the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0.**
