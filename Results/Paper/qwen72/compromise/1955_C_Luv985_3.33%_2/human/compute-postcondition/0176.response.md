Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0.***
