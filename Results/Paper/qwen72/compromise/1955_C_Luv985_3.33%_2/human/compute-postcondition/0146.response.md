Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is an integer that counts the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
