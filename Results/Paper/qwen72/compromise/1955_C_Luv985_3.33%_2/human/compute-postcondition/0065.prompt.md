Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi` (or `a[n-2] - mi` if `a[n-1]` was 0). If `a[l]` (which is `a[0]` after adjustment) is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is updated to 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is the value of `a[1]` minus `mi`. If `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]` after adjustment) is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is updated to 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is unknown. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, `ans` is updated to 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `l` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `a[r]` was not 0, or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[r]` was not 0, or 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` was 0, depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r` plus the increment by 1 if `a[l]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and can be 1, 2, or 3. In all cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
