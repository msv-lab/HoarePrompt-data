To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `r - l > 1`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted, as they are the ones used in the loop condition.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n
- `n` is the length of `array`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is n

We need to check if `r - l > 1` holds true. With `l` being 0 and `r` being `n`, the condition becomes `n - 0 > 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

Since `n` is the length of `array` and `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `n` must be at least 1. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state, as the condition `r - l > 1` will be true if `n` is greater than 1, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is n**
