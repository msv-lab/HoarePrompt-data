The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a tuple containing the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, the number of cubes to be removed `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` cubes while keeping Dmitry's favorite cube based on the values of the cubes. The function prints 'NO' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is greater than the value of the favorite cube, 'YES' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is less than the value of the favorite cube, and 'MAYBE' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is equal to the value of the favorite cube and the conditions are met. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
