The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The parameters have the following constraints: `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips do not coincide (`x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`). Additionally, the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, where `h` and `w` define the dimensions of a grid, and `x_a`, `y_a` and `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on this grid. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
