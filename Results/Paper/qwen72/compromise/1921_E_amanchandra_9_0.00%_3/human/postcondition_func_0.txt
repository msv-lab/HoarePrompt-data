The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid defined by dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of two chips (Alice's and Bob's) on this grid, given by coordinates `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, the function determines and prints the result as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the relative positions of the chips and the grid dimensions. The final state of the function is that all test cases have been processed, and the result for each case has been printed. The variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are reset and re-assigned for each test case, and their final values are those from the last test case processed.
