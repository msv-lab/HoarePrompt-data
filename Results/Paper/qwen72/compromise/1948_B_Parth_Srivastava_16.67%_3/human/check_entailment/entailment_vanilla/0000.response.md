### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array:**
   - The function iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the transformed list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

5. **Output:**
   - The program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The transformation logic is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the splitting of elements greater than 10 and their insertion into the array.
  - Specifically, the conditions for splitting and appending digits are not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not correctly determine that it cannot be sorted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where multiple elements need to be split and inserted in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the given operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
