### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and the details of each test case, including the length `k` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Splitting Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each element in the list `a`. If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its tens and units digits and appends them to the list `c` under certain conditions.
   - The conditions for splitting are:
     - If the element is the first in the list (`i == 0`), it splits the element and appends the digits to `c` if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
     - If the element is not the first in the list (`i > 0`), it splits the element and appends the digits to `c` if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the previous element in `c` and the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
     - If the above conditions are not met, the original element is appended to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to the original list `c`.
   - If `c` is already sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted.
   - If `c` is not sorted, it appends `0` to the list `b`, indicating that the array cannot be sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The main loop iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' if the value is `1` and 'NO' if the value is `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The program only splits elements if they are greater than 10 and appends the digits under specific conditions. However, it should split any element greater than or equal to 10 and always append the digits in the correct order.
  - The current logic does not handle cases where the element is greater than 10 and the tens digit is greater than the units digit correctly. For example, if the element is 21, it should be split into 2 and 1, but the program might not do this if the conditions are not met.

- **Incorrect Comparison:**
  - The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing. However, it should check if the list `c` can be sorted by the operations described in the problem statement, not just if it is already sorted.
  - The program does not consider the possibility of multiple operations to sort the list.

### Correctness:
- **False**
  - The program's logic for splitting elements and checking if the list can be sorted is flawed. It does not correctly handle all cases where elements can be split to achieve a sorted list.

### Example:
- For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should split 12 into 1 and 2, and 45 into 4 and 5, and 67 into 6 and 7, resulting in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.
- For the input `[12, 28, 5]`, the program should split 12 into 1 and 2, and 28 into 2 and 8, resulting in the list `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which cannot be sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
