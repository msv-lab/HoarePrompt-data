#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but the function definition is incomplete. The input parameters should include a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list, and the function should handle multiple test cases, so an additional integer `t` representing the number of test cases should also be included. Each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the size of `a` is 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        *inp, = map(int, input().split())
        
        x = y = n + 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                x == y
                y = a
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then calculates the number of elements in `a` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
