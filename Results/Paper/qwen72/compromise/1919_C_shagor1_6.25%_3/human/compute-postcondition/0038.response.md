Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns `x` and `y` the value `n + 1`.
- The value of `n` is an input integer, and `n + 1` is the new value for both `x` and `y`.
- The other variables (`t`, `inp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `inp`, and `ans` are still valid.
- The new values for `x` and `y` are both `n + 1`.
