Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `y` is the first element in the list `inp`. `a` is the first element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`.***
