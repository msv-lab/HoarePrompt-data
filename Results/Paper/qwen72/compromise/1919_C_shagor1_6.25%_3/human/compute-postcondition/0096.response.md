Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` is the third element in `inp`, `y` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is larger), and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `a` > `y`, then `y` is the third element in `inp` and `ans` is either 1 or 2.**
