Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in `inp`, and `a` is greater than `x`. Additionally, the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `y`.**
