Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. The loop will execute one more time if the input value `n` is greater than 1.**
