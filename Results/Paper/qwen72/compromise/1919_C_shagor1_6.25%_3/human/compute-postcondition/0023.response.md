Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the second element in the list `inp`, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. If the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0. If the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. If the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`. If the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 2.***
