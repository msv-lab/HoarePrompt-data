To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. According to the state before the loop, `results` contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no'. Therefore, `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **`i`**: This variable will be assigned the values from `results` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` should be the first element of `results`.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` is non-empty and `i` is the first element of `results`.

State: **`results` is a list of 'yes' or 'no' with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `results`**
