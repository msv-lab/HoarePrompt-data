You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` has read `t` test cases from stdin, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n` and a string `arr`. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. Specifically, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input.
    for i in results:
        print(i)

The loop has printed each element of the `results` list, one per line. The `results` list is unchanged after the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of coins and their initial states represented by a string of "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to achieve a specific condition and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results` based on the following rules: If the number of coins `n` is even, 'no' is appended. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `results`, one per line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the number of coins `n` is even and if the count of 'U' (facing-up coins) is greater than the count of 'D' (facing-down coins) when `n` is odd. However, this logic does not capture the optimal play strategy for the game.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
UDD
```
According to the problem description, Alice should win this game if both players play optimally. Here's how the game could go:

1. **Initial State:** `UDD`
2. **Alice's Turn:** Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes `DDU`.
3. **Bob's Turn:** Bob has no 'U' coins to choose from, so he loses.

However, the program will output `no` (or `NO`), which is incorrect. The program's logic fails to consider the optimal play strategy, where Alice can always force a win if there is at least one 'U' coin and the number of coins is odd.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly determine the winner, the program should consider the following:
- If `n` is even, Bob will always win because Alice will always leave an even number of coins for Bob, and Bob can mirror Alice's moves.
- If `n` is odd, Alice can always win if there is at least one 'U' coin. This is because Alice can always remove an 'U' coin and flip the adjacent coins, leaving Bob in a position where he will eventually be forced to lose.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif 'U' in arr:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)
```

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem.
