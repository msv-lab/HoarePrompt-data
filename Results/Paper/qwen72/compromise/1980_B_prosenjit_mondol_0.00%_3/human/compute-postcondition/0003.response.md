Functionality: ** The function `func` reads `t` test cases from the input, where each test case consists of `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the `f`-th element of `a` (0-indexed) is greater than, less than, or equal to the `k`-th element of the sorted list `a` (in descending order). It prints 'NO' if the `f`-th element is greater than the `k`-th element, 'YES' if it is less than or equal to the `k`-th element, and 'MAYBE' if it is equal to the `k`-th element and `k` is not the last index or the element before `k` is less than the `f`-th element. After all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will have their final values as determined by the last test case. **
