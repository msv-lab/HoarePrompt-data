Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube will be removed. Specifically, the condition `print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')` is incorrect. 

Here's a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting the array in non-increasing order, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The first two cubes are `[4, 3]`, and the favorite cube could be in the second position, which means it could be removed. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it checks `a[k] > x` and `a[k] < x` but does not correctly handle the case where `a[k] == x`.

The correct logic should consider the possibility that the favorite cube might be in the range of the first `k` cubes if its value is equal to `a[k]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
