Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up. This is a valid and efficient way to compute the sum of digits.

2. **Main Loop**: The main loop reads the number of test cases `N` and then iterates `N` times to read each test case. For each test case, it iterates from 0 to `n-1` and adds the sum of the digits of each number to the variable `soma`. However, the problem description specifies that the numbers on the board are from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The loop should start from 1 and go to `n` to match the problem requirements.

3. **Output**: The program prints the total sum `soma` after processing all test cases. However, the problem requires the sum to be printed for each test case individually, not the cumulative sum of all test cases.

4. **Efficiency**: The program's current approach is not efficient for large inputs. The time complexity is \(O(t \cdot n)\), where \(t\) is the number of test cases and \(n\) is the largest number in each test case. Given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), this approach will likely exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. **Correctness of the Sum Calculation**: The sum of the digits for each number is calculated correctly, but the overall structure of the program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the test cases individually and does not start the digit sum calculation from 1.

Correctness: **False**
