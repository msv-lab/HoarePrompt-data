Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[l]` was 0), `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the previous iteration and whether `a[l]` was 0). If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` (depending on the previous iteration) and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the previous iteration and whether `a[l]` was 0). If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
