Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` and the unchanged values of `T`, `n`, and `k`.
