The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is a non-zero value, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is described as an input integer, but there is no specific constraint on its value. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be a positive integer.

State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9**
