Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (2 * mi)`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `l` is 0, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3.***
