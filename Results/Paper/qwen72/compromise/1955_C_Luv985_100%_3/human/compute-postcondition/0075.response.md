Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is the first input value as an integer, `k` is the second input value as an integer, `a` is a list of strings representing integers, `l` is the index after the last valid left index where `a[l]` was not zero, `r` is the index before the last valid right index where `a[r]` was not zero, `ans` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. Each string represents an integer.
- The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this code, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
- `a` is now a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer.
- The initial conditions for `l` and `r` (indices in the list `a` where values are updated in each iteration) and `ans` (incremented based on a condition) are still valid but unchanged by this code.
