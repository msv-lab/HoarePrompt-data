Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the variable `mi`, which is assigned the minimum value between the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`).
