Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

The value of `T` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
