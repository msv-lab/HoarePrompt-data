Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[n - 1]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `ans` is 1, and `a[0]` is non-zero. If `a[n - 1]` is non-zero, `r` is `n - 1` and `ans` is 0 or 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
