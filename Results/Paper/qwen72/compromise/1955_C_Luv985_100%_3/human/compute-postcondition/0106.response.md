Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the update, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 2; and if it was 2, it becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
