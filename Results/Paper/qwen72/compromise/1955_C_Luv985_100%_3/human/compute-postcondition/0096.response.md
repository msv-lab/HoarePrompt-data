Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and the value of `a[l]` is equal to `t + k // 2`.**
