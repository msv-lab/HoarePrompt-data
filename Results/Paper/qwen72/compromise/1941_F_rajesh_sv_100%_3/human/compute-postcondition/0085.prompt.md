Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, `mid` is the final value of `l` (or `h`), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `f` is `F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f` or -1 if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[1]`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` if `l` is updated, otherwise `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` with the original `l`, `f` is `F[1]`, and `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[1]`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `f` is `F[1]`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute again.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`mid_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + F[1]`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `f` is `F[1]`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
