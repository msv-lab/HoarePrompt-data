Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, and `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`. `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` and `max_diff` remain unchanged, and `index` remains unchanged.***
