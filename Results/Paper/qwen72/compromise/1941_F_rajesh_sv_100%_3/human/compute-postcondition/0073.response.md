To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case are `l` and `h`. The loop condition is `l < h`, so for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `h`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.
- `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `h` is updated to `mid`.

Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, we can infer that `i` is at least 1. However, `i` is not directly relevant to the loop condition `l < h`.

The key variables to consider are `l` and `h`. For the loop to execute again:
- `l` should be less than `h`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide specific values for `l` and `h`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the loop to proceed. The previous updates to `l` and `h` should be maintained, but we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.
- `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `h` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain that `l` is less than `h`.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[1]`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` if `l` is updated, otherwise `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` with the original `l`, `f` is `F[1]`, and `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `h` is updated to `mid`. `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute again.**
