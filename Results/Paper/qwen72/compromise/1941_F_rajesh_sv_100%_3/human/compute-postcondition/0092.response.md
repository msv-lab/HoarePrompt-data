To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables `l` and `h` because they are the only ones involved in the loop condition `l < h`.

### Given Program State:
- `mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`
- `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`
- `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists
- `mid` is equal to `l`
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`
- `f` is `F[2]`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `l < h`.
- For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`.
- `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists.

### Adjustments:
- If `h` is -1, the loop will not execute because `l` cannot be less than -1.
- Therefore, `h` must be a valid index in `D` and `l` must be less than `h`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `h` must be a valid index in `D` and `l` must be less than `h`.

### Final State:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` and `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`**
