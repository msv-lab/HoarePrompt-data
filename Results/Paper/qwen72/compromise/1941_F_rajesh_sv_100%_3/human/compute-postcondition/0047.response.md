Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` calculates the midpoint between `l` and `h` and assigns it to `mid`.
- `l` and `h` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is given that `l` is less than `h`.
- The expression `(h - l) // 2` computes the integer division of the difference between `h` and `l` by 2.
- `mid` is then assigned the value of `l` plus this integer division result.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
