Functionality: ** The function `func_6` processes three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific constraints. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in `A`. It then uses a binary search on `D` to find the minimum possible maximum difference that can be achieved by adding elements from `F` to elements in `D` and adjusting the gap between the identified largest difference in `A`. Finally, it prints the maximum of this adjusted minimum difference and the second largest difference in `A`. The function does not return any value, and the lists `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
