The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterator `_` is not used and does not affect the state, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `testcases` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called twice.**
