Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists, `mid` is `l` (since `l` and `h` converge), `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`, and `l` is equal to `h`.**
