Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is equal to `h` and `mid` is the final value of `l` (or `h`), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variables `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, `diff`, `left`, `right`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial values. The loop variables `l` and `h` converge to the same value, which is the final value of `l` (or `h`). The variable `mid` is equal to this final value of `l` (or `h`). The variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to `D[mid] + F[0]` and `D[mid + 1] + F[0]` respectively, provided that `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`. If `mid + 1` is out of bounds, `mid_next_sum` is undefined.
