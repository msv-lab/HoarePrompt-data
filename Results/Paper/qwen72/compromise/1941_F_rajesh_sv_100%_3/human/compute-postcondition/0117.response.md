Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`A`**: A list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order.
2. **`n`**: The length of `A`, which is greater than or equal to 2.
3. **`m` and `k`**: Values returned by `func_4()`.
4. **`D`**: A sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`.
5. **`F`**: A list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`.
6. **`max_diff`**: The largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`.
7. **`next_max_diff`**: The second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`.
8. **`index`**: The index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference.
9. **`i`**: `n - 1` (the last index of `A`).
10. **`diff`**: The difference between the last two elements in `A`.
11. **`left`**: `A[index - 1]` (the element in `A` just before the largest difference).
12. **`right`**: `A[index]` (the element in `A` just after the largest difference).
13. **`ans`**: The minimum of the initial `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[j] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[j]` for all `j` in `0` to `k-1`, where `l` is the index found by the binary search for each `f` in `F`.
14. **`l`**: The final index found by the binary search for the last `f` in `F`.
15. **`h`**: The final index found by the binary search for the last `f` in `F` (same as `l`).
16. **`mid`**: The final value of `l` (or `h`) for the last `f` in `F`.
17. **`mid_sum`**: `D[mid] + F[k-1]`.
18. **`mid_next_sum`**: `D[mid + 1] + F[k-1]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise undefined.

### Print Statement:
```
print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`max_diff` and `next_max_diff`**:
   - `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`.
   - `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`.

2. **`ans`**:
   - `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[j] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[j]` for all `j` in `0` to `k-1`.
   - This means `ans` is a value that has been updated based on some calculations involving `D`, `F`, `left`, and `right`.

3. **`max(ans, next_max_diff)`**:
   - The `max` function will return the larger of the two values: `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the larger of the two values: `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

- `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[j] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[j]` for all `j` in `0` to `k-1`.
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `D`, and `F` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `A`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of the initial ans and the maximum of D[l] + F[j] - left and right - D[l] - F[j] for all j in 0 to k-1, and next_max_diff is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in A)**
