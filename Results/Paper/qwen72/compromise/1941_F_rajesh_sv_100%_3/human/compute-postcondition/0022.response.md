Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, and `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` but not greater than `max_diff`. `index` is either None or 1. `i` is 2. If `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`.***
