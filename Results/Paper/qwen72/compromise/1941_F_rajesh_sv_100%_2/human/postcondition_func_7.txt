The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases by calling `func_3` and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` holds the number of iterations that were executed, and `func_6` has been called `testcases` times. The function does not return any value.
