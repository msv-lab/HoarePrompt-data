Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum difference is the first or last difference in the sorted array of complexities. Specifically, the logic in the binary search part of `func_6` assumes that the optimal insertion point for a new problem will always be between two existing problems. However, if the maximum difference is at the beginning or end of the array, the new problem might need to be inserted at the start or end of the array to minimize the imbalance, which the current logic does not account for. For example, if the input is:

```
1
4 2 2
1 10 20 30
1 2
5 10
```

The maximum difference is between 1 and 10, and the program will not correctly consider inserting a new problem at the beginning of the array to minimize this difference. The expected output for this case is 5, but the program will output 9.
