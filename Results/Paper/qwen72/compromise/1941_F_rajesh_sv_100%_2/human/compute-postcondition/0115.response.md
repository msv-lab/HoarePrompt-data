Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `l` and `h` converge to the same index, which is the index of the element in `D` that is closest to the midpoint of the range defined by `left - f` and `right - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second value in `F`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state. If `l` is equal to `h`, the same conditions apply as described above.***
