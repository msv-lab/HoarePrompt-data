The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `testcases`. The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not hold any significant state. The loop's execution depends on the value of `testcases`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 1, and `_` is a dummy variable that changes with each iteration but does not affect the loop's condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0 after the iteration. Since `_` is a dummy variable, its value is not relevant to the state.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` will be incremented by 1 (though its value is not significant).
- `testcases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1, `_` is a dummy variable**
