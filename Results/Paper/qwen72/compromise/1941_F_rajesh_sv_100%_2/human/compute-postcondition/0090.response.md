Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` and `h` converge to the same index, which is `mid`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second value in `F`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` using the `bisect_right` function.
- All other variables (`total`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `ans`, `f`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state.
