Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`, and `index` is set to 3. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains the same, `index` remains the same, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains the same.**
