The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the input. It then computes a list `p` of `n` integers such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` in each iteration. The function prints the list `p` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function ends.
