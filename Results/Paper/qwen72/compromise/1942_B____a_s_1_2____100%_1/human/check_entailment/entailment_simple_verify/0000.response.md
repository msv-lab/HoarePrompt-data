Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The program effectively constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` by working backwards and maintaining the MEX value. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions, indicating that no values have been set yet.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start. This is a reasonable initial value because the MEX of an empty array is 0, and the MEX of an array with all elements from 0 to `n-1` is `n`.

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This step is based on the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), which can be rearranged to \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the permutation up to the current index.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

The key points to validate the correctness are:
- The program ensures that `p[i]` is always a valid permutation element (i.e., it is a non-negative integer less than `n`).
- The MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` is correctly calculated and used to determine `p[i]`.
- The program handles the constraints and requirements of the problem description correctly.

Given the problem's guarantee that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given data, and the program's consistent and logical approach to constructing `p`, the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
