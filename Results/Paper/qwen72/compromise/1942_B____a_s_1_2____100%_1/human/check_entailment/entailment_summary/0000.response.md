Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and `p` to a list of `-1` of length `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation, and initially, no integers are in the permutation.

2. **Backward Construction**: The program constructs the permutation `p` in reverse order. This is a clever approach because it allows the program to use the current `mex` value to determine the correct value for `p[i]` based on the equation `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.

3. **Updating `mex`**: After setting `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation.

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 1)
    - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 2)
    - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2` (Correct, MEX is 2)
    - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 3)
    - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2` (Correct, MEX is 5)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 1)
    - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 2)
    - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 3)
    - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 4)
    - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 5)

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2` (Correct, MEX is 0)
    - `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1` (Correct, MEX is 1)
    - `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2` (Correct, MEX is 3)

The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation `p` from the array `a` and produces valid outputs for the given examples. The logic ensures that the `mex` value is updated appropriately, and the permutation `p` is constructed in a way that satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct.
