Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the relationship \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\). The program's approach is to work backwards from the last element of `a` to the first, which is a valid strategy given the nature of the MEX function and the constraints of the problem.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is because the MEX of the full permutation \(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\) is `n` (since all integers from 0 to \(n-1\) are present).

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The loop iterates from \(i = n-1\) to \(i = 0\).
   - For each index \(i\), the program sets \(p_i = \texttt{mex} - a_i\).
   - Then, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and \(p_i\). This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest integer that has not yet been used in the permutation up to the current index \(i\).

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p` for each test case, it prints the elements of `p` separated by spaces.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
   - The logic for constructing `p` is sound because it ensures that the MEX of the subarray \(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i\) is consistent with the given `a` values.
   - The update of `mex` ensures that the values in `p` are unique and within the range \([0, n-1]\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 1\) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, as seen in the second test case of the example.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
