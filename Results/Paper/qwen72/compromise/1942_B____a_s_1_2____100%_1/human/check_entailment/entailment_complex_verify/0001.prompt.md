You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the input integer, `n` is the last read integer from the input, and `a` is the last read list of integers from the input. The list `p` contains the computed values for the current iteration of the loop, and it is printed. The values of `mex` are not retained between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the input. It then computes a list `p` of `n` integers such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` in each iteration. The function prints the list `p` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` such that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from `a`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - For each `i`, `a[i]` is the difference between the MEX of the first `i` elements of `p` and `p[i]`.
   - Therefore, `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values.
   - It starts from the last element of `p` and works its way backward.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the current minimum excluded value.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly set `p[i]`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Initialization:** `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value for the MEX of a permutation of length `n`.
   - **Backward Construction:** By starting from the last element and moving backward, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of `p` up to the current index.
   - **MEX Update:** The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - **Permutation Validity:** Since the input is guaranteed to have at least one valid permutation, the program will always find a valid `p` by the end of the loop.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and the update of `p` are designed to work with these values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a valid permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
