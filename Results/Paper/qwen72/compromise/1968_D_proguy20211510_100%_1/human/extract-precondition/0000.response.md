Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should take parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. `p` is a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of length `n` containing positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9.**
