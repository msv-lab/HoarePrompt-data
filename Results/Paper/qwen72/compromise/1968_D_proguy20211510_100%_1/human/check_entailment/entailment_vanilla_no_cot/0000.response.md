Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the way the scores are calculated does not correctly simulate the game's rules, where a player can either stay at the current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. The current implementation only considers the path where the player always moves to the next position in the permutation, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly simulates the game and considers both staying and moving:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start):
            score = 0
            position = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[position - 1]
                if a[position - 1] >= a[p[position - 1] - 1]:
                    # Stay at the current position
                    next_position = position
                else:
                    # Move to the next position
                    next_position = p[position - 1]
                position = next_position
            return score
        
        score_bodya = simulate_game(pb)
        score_sasha = simulate_game(ps)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

**Key Changes:**

1. **Simulation Function**: A helper function `simulate_game` is created to simulate the game for a given starting position. This function iterates `k` times, each time adding the score from the current position and deciding whether to stay or move based on the comparison of the current position's score and the next position's score.

2. **Decision Making**: The decision to stay or move is made by comparing the score at the current position with the score at the next position in the permutation. If the current position's score is greater or equal, the player stays; otherwise, the player moves.

3. **Score Calculation**: The scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated using the `simulate_game` function and then compared to determine the winner.

This corrected version should accurately simulate the game and determine the winner based on the given rules.
