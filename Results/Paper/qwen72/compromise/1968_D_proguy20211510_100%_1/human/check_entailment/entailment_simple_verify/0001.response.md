### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the sequence of scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Path Traversal:**
   - The program correctly traverses the permutation starting from Bodya's position `pb` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `pathb` until it encounters a previously visited position.
   - Similarly, it traverses the permutation starting from Sasha's position `ps` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `paths` until it encounters a previously visited position.
   - The `vis` list is reset for Sasha's path, which is correct because the paths for Bodya and Sasha are independent.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic in the original program is incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation for each turn.
   - The current logic calculates the score as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which is not correct. It should calculate the score for each turn and then determine the maximum possible score.
   - The original program does not handle cycles in the permutation correctly. It should identify the cycle and calculate the score for the pre-cycle part and the full cycles, and finally add the score for the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

### Issues:
1. **Variable Names:**
   - The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but not used in the program. These can be removed as they are unnecessary.
   - The variable `alpha` is defined but not used. This can also be removed.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic is incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation for each turn.
   - The current logic calculates the score as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which is not correct. It should calculate the score for each turn and then determine the maximum possible score.
   - The program does not handle cycles in the permutation correctly. It should identify the cycle and calculate the score for the pre-cycle part and the full cycles, and finally add the score for the remaining turns.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start, k):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            curr = start
            while not vis[curr - 1]:
                vis[curr - 1] = 1
                path.append(a[curr - 1])
                curr = p[curr - 1]
            
            cycle_start = path.index(a[curr - 1])
            cycle_length = len(path) - cycle_start
            cycle_sum = sum(path[cycle_start:])
            pre_cycle_sum = sum(path[:cycle_start])
            
            if k < cycle_start:
                return sum(path[:k])
            else:
                full_cycles = (k - cycle_start) // cycle_length
                remaining_turns = (k - cycle_start) % cycle_length
                return pre_cycle_sum + full_cycles * cycle_sum + sum(path[cycle_start:cycle_start + remaining_turns])
        
        score_bodya = calculate_score(pb, k)
        score_sasha = calculate_score(ps, k)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `calculate_score`:**
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position and the number of turns `k`.
   - It first traverses the permutation to find the path and the cycle.
   - It then calculates the score for the pre-cycle part and the full cycles, and finally adds the score for the remaining turns.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function reads the input and calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
The original program has issues with the score calculation logic, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct output for the given problem.

Final: **False**
