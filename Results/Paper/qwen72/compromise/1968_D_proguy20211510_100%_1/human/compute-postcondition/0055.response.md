Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least one integer, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value (0) and `curr`.
- `curr` is calculated as `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `pathb[0] * k`.
- Therefore, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
