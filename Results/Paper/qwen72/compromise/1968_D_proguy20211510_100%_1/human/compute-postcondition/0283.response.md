The code snippet provided is simply a `print` statement that prints the string 'Sasha'. The initial state describes several variables (`i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **Sasha**
