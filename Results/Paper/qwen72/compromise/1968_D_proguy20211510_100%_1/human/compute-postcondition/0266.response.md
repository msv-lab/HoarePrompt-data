The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `paths`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `paths`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `paths` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must have at least two elements.

State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
