Output State: **`i` is 0, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, if `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**

The value of `preb` is updated by adding the first element of the list `pathb` to it. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
