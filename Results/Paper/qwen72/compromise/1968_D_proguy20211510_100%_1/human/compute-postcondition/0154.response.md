Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `pathb` still must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` remains 1.
- `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `preb` remains `preb + pathb[0]`.
- `resb` remains the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`.
- If `k` is less than 2, we still break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
