Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the following variables have been updated: `i` is equal to the length of `paths` minus 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is the final value of `pres + paths[-1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, and `ress` is the maximum value encountered in the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `paths` minus 1. If `k` is less than the length of `paths` at any point, the loop breaks early, and the final values of `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` are those calculated up to that point.**
