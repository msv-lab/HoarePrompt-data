Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n`, `p` is a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is an array of length `n` containing positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all iterations, or it broke early if `k` was less than the length of `paths` at any point. `i` is equal to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the value of `i` when the loop broke. `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` up to the point where the loop completed or broke. `curr` is the final value of `pres + paths[-1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, or the value calculated up to the point where the loop broke. `ress` is the maximum value encountered in the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the maximum value calculated up to the point where the loop broke. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, and `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`. If `resb` > `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop. If `resb` > `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
