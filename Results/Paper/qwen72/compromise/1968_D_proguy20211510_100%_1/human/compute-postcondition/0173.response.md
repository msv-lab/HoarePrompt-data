Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k` is less than 2, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, and if `k` is less than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`.***
