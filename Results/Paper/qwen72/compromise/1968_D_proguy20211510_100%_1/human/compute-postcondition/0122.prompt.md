Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed one iteration, and it will execute one more time if the input-specified number of iterations has not been reached. `n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the third input value converted to an integer, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input. `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `pb - 1` is now 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the integer value `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the element at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the integer value `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the element at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is now `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the element at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
