Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least one integer, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least two integers, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `curr` is now equal to `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least three integers, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0] + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr` is now equal to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)` if `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `k` is less than 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
