Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, and `pb` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks.**

Explanation:
- The line `vis = [0] * n` initializes `vis` as a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
- The previous state of `vis` (where each element was 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1`, which was 1) is overwritten.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `pb`) remain unchanged.
