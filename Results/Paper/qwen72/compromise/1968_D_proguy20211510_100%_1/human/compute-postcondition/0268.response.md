Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
