Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list containing at least two elements, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
