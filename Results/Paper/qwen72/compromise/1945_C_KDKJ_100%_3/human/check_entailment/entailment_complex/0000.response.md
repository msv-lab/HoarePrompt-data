Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the optimal position to build a road in the village of Letovo such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1`**:
   - **Input**: Reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user.
   - **Processing**:
     - Constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i-1`-th character of `a`.
     - Iterates through all possible positions to place the road (from 0 to `n`), and for each position, checks if the number of '0's on the left side and the number of '1's on the right side meet the satisfaction condition.
     - If a position meets the condition, it updates `ans` to the position that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.
   - **Output**: Prints the optimal position `i`.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - **Processing**:
     - For each test case, calls `func_1` to process the input and print the result.
   - **Output**: No explicit output, but each call to `func_1` will print the result for the corresponding test case.

**Validation of the Solution**:
- The cumulative count list `S` is correctly constructed, allowing efficient computation of the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of any potential road position.
- The condition checks `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The program correctly finds the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n / 2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions.
- The program handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` within `func_2`.

**Edge Cases**:
- The program handles the edge case where the road is placed before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`).
- The program also handles the case where the entire village can be declared as one side (either all '0's or all '1's).

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
