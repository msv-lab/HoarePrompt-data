The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer (greater than 0). Since the function `func_2` does not take any parameters, there are no other variables to consider.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
