The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(test_cases)`. The other variables (`t`, `x_a`, `x_b`, `h`, `y_a`, `y_b`, `w`) and the list `answers` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list**
