Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the outcome when the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that Bob can win by moving to Alice's position in his first move. For example, consider the input `4 4 2 2 3 2`. Here, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (3, 2). Bob can move up to (2, 2) on his first move, capturing Alice's chip and winning the game. However, the program will incorrectly output "Draw" for this case.
