The only objects in the loop head are the variables `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `qi` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `qi` is 0**
