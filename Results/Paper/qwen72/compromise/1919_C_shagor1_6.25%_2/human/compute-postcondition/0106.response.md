The function `func` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided function signature. Based on the parameter constraints and relationships, the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the organized information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the input list for each test case.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the function likely processes the input list `a` for each test case and returns some result based on the processing. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Assuming the function returns a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes the list `a` for each of the `t` test cases and returns a result based on the processing of the list `a`.**
