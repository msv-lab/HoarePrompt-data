Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` is set to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a`, `ans` is set to 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` otherwise `ans` is not set.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is now set to `a`.
- The value of `x` remains the same as it was before the code execution, which is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`.
- The value of `ans` remains the same as it was before the code execution, which is set to 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is not set.
- The values of `n` and `inp` are not affected.
- The value of `a` remains the third element in `inp`.
