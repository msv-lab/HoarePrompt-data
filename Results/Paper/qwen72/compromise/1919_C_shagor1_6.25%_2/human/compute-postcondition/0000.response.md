The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a temporary variable used to iterate over the range. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
