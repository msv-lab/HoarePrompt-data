Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1. In both cases, `a` is the first element in `inp`.***
