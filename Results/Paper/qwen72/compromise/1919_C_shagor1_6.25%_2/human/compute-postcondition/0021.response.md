Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `ans` is 0 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `x` is either `n + 1` or the first element of `inp`, `y` is now the second element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to be the second element in the list `inp`, which is stored in the variable `a`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `inp`, `a`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
