Postcondition: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in `inp`, and the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `x` (which is `n + 1`).**
