The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `x` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is increased by 1, `x` remains unchanged.**
