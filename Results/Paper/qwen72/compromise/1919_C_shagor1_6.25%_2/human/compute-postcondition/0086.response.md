Postcondition: ***`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `a` is greater than `x`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is increased by 1.***
