Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` and `y` are not equal if `a` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is set to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` remains `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` otherwise `y` is set to `a`, `ans` is set to 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` otherwise `ans` is not set.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x == y` checks if `x` and `y` are equal but does not change their values.
- If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`.
- If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.
- The values of `n` and `inp` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a` remains the third element in `inp`.
- The condition that `x` and `y` are not equal if `a` is greater than `n + 1` is still valid.
