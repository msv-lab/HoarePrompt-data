Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the previous condition), `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is set to the second element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.**
