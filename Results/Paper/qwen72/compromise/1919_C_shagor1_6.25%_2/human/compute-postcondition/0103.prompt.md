Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. The loop will execute again if the new integer input is greater than the current iteration count.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `a` is greater than `x`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `x` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is increased by 1, `x` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`, `y` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`, `x` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, then `y` is set to `a`, `x` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
