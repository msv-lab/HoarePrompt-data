Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the `func_2` function incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem description requires the program to output "No" if no suitable permutation exists, but the program returns a tuple `(0, 0)` instead. This tuple is then incorrectly used in `func_4` to print "NO" when it should directly print "No" without the tuple.

Additionally, the `func_1` function does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the program should output "No" because no permutation of length 4 can have a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this case correctly and may return an invalid permutation.
