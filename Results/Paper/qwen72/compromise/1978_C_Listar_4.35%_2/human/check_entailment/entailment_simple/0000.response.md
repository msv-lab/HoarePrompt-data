### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_4()` for each one.
   - `func_4()` is responsible for processing each test case by calling `func_2()` to validate the input and `func_1()` to generate the permutation if possible.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`:
     - For odd `n`, `max_k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\).
     - For even `n`, `max_k` is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `0, 0`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - If `k` is valid (even and within the range), it returns `n` and `k`.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - It then iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, attempting to rearrange elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The loop condition and the logic inside the loop ensure that the permutation is modified in a way that reduces `k` to 0 while maintaining the permutation properties.
   - If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It then prints a blank line to separate the output for different test cases.

5. **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
   - This function orchestrates the entire process for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2()` to validate the input and get the updated `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` to generate the permutation and then `func_3()` to print it.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Validation:**
  - `func_2()` correctly checks if `k` is even and if it is within the valid range for the given `n`.
  - The maximum possible Manhattan value is correctly calculated based on the parity of `n`.

- **Permutation Generation:**
  - `func_1()` attempts to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by rearranging elements from the end of the list to the beginning.
  - The logic inside the loop ensures that the permutation is modified in a way that reduces `k` to 0 while maintaining the permutation properties.
  - The function correctly returns the modified list `l` if a valid permutation is found.

- **Output:**
  - `func_3()` correctly prints the permutation if it exists.
  - `func_4()` correctly handles the output for each test case, printing "NO" if no valid permutation exists and "YES" followed by the permutation if it does.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, generates the required permutation, and prints the appropriate output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
