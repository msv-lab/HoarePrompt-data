### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function checks if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - It correctly checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct and ensures that only valid `n` and `k` pairs are passed to `func_1`.

3. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, and for each element, it checks if it can be moved to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` is zero, it returns the list as is.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - The function aims to construct the permutation by moving elements to the correct positions to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent move of the last element to position `-k` is intended to reduce `k` by the smallest possible amount while maintaining the permutation's validity.
   - The logic of decrementing `k` by `i` and moving the last element to the beginning is a step towards reducing `k` in a controlled manner.
   - However, the logic is not clearly explained and may not always produce a valid permutation with the correct Manhattan value. For example, the specific conditions and the way elements are moved might not cover all edge cases or might not be optimal.

4. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

5. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function is the main function that handles the input and output.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the permutation.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output, calling the appropriate functions to check for a valid permutation and generate it if possible.

### Conclusion:
- **Function 2:**
  - The logic is correct and ensures that only valid `n` and `k` pairs are passed to `func_1`.

- **Function 1:**
  - The logic to generate the permutation is not robust enough to handle all cases and may produce incorrect results.
  - The specific conditions and the way elements are moved might not cover all edge cases or might not be optimal.
  - For example, the condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent move of the last element to position `-k` might not always reduce `k` correctly or might not maintain the permutation's validity.

- **Function 3:**
  - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

- **Function 4:**
  - The function correctly handles the input and output, calling the appropriate functions to check for a valid permutation and generate it if possible.

### Correctness:
- The program may not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value, especially in the `func_1` function.
- The logic in `func_1` is not robust enough to handle all cases and may produce incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
