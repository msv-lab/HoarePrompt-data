### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - **Odd `k` Handling:** The function returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd. This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even. This is because each swap of two elements in the permutation changes the Manhattan value by an even number (either +2 or -2).
   - **Maximum `k` Calculation:** The function calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. For an even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`, and for an odd `n`, it is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`. This is correct because the maximum Manhattan value is achieved when the permutation is reversed.
   - **Return Values:** If `k` is greater than the maximum possible value, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`. This is correct because it ensures that the program only attempts to generate a permutation if `k` is within the valid range.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n` and `k` are passed as arguments.
   - **Initial List:** The function initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - **Loop to Adjust Permutation:**
     - The function iterates from the end of the list to the beginning.
     - If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l` as the permutation.
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of the list to the position `-k` (i.e., `k` positions from the end).
     - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - **Behavior Evaluation:**
     - The function correctly attempts to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - However, the logic for adjusting the permutation is not entirely clear and may not always produce the correct result. For example, the condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent move of the last element to the position `-k` might not always result in the correct permutation.

3. **Function `func_3` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** A list `l` representing the permutation.
   - **Output:** The function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.
   - **Correctness:** This function is correct and follows the problem description for printing a valid permutation.

4. **Function `func_4` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** No parameters.
   - **Output:** The function prints "NO" if `func_2` returns `(0, 0)` and calls `func_1` and `func_3` otherwise.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles the output based on the result of `func_2`. If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and exits. Otherwise, it generates the permutation using `func_1` and prints it using `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment:** The original assessment is partially correct. The function `func_2` correctly identifies invalid cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value. However, the function `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value, especially for edge cases like `n = 4` and `k = 5`.

- **Final Decision:** The program is **incorrect** because `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, the permutation for `n = 4` and `k = 5` should be "No", but the current implementation may return an invalid permutation.

### Final: **False**
