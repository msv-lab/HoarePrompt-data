Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`, and `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. The new values of `n` and `k` are unknown but still satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0. `func_3(l)` has been called, and its return value (if any) is not specified.**
