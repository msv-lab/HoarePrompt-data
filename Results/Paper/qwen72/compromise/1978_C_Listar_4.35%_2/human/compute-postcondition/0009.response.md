Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_2`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`. The final state of the program is that `func_4` has either printed 'NO' and returned, or it has called `func_1` and `func_3` without printing anything. **
