The function `func_2` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from user input where `1 <= n <= 200,000` and `0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000`. It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum allowed value (`max_k`). If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The maximum allowed value of `k` (`max_k`) is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, or `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.
