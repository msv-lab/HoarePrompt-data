### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
    - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index` by performing the MEX operation.
    - **Issues**:
        - The initial value of `res` is set to `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX operation is not related to the square of the length of the segment.
        - The logic for calculating `new_res` and updating `res` does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The MEX of a segment is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, and this is not being calculated or used correctly.
        - The function does not correctly handle the base case for a single element segment. It returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`, which is not necessarily the correct MEX value.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
    - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
    - **Issues**:
        - The function relies on the incorrect results from `func_1`, so it will not generate the correct sequence of operations.
        - The condition `if max_value == length ** 2` is incorrect. The maximum value should be the sum of the elements after performing the MEX operation, not the square of the length of the segment.
        - The function does not correctly handle the MEX operation or the updates to the array.

3. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
    - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to modify the array to form a "staircase" of MEX values.
    - **Issues**:
        - The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the segment. It assumes that the MEX value for a segment can be directly set to `i` without considering the actual values in the segment.
        - The function does not ensure that the smallest non-negative integer missing from the segment is used.
        - The function does not correctly handle the updates to the array. It sets all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` to `i`, which is not the correct MEX value.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
    ```
    3
    0 2 1
    ```
- **Expected Output**:
    ```
    6 1
    1 3
    ```
- **Actual Output**:
    - The program will not produce the correct output because the logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` is flawed.
    - The correct operation would be to set the entire array to the MEX of the segment `[0, 2, 1]`, which is `3`, resulting in the array `[3, 3, 3]` and a sum of `9`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the specified operations. The issues in `func_1` and `make_stairs` lead to incorrect results and operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
