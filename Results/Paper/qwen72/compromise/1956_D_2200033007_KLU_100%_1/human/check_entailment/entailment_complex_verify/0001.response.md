### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - The array length is limited to 18, and the number of operations is limited to 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - For larger subarrays, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the corresponding operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" and appends the operation to the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the partition that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations for those partitions.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired "staircase" form.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operations to the result.

5. **Original Assessment Issues:**
   - **Global Variables:** The use of global variables `arr` and `res` can lead to issues with state management. It is better to pass these variables as arguments to the functions.
   - **MEX Calculation:** The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX is correctly computed, but this is not clear from the provided code. The MEX calculation should be implemented and used in the functions to ensure the correctness of the operations.
   - **Staircase Transformation:** The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented. It should transform the subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i, but the current implementation does not achieve this. The function should correctly set the elements to the MEX value and append the operations to the result.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function correctly uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
     - The base case and recursive case are logically sound.
     - However, the MEX calculation is missing, and the function assumes it is correctly computed.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations based on the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
     - The logic for handling subarrays of length 1 and for checking if the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length is correct.
     - However, the `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect transformations.
   - **Function 3:**
     - The function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" but does not correctly implement the MEX calculation.
     - The function does not set the elements to the correct MEX values and does not append the operations to the result correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues with the MEX calculation and the incorrect implementation of the `make_stairs` function, the provided program is not correct. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is sound, but the lack of a proper MEX calculation and the incorrect transformation logic in `make_stairs` lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
