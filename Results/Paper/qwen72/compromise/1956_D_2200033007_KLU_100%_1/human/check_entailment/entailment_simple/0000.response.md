### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, and the function returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index`.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarrays.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first checks if the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray. If so, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" pattern and appends the operation to the result list.
   - If the maximum value is not equal to the square of the length, it tries to find a split point `i` that maximizes the sum and recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays.
   - If no such split point is found, it checks if the maximum value can be achieved by modifying the first or last element of the subarray and recursively constructs the operations for the remaining subarray.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is designed to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where each element is equal to its index.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern. If so, it returns.
   - If the subarray is not in the desired pattern, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting all elements to the MEX value and appending the operation to the result list.

5. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program reads the input, calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum, and then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - The results are then printed in the required format.

6. **Issues and Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum sum using dynamic programming.
   - The function `func_2` correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The function `make_stairs` correctly transforms the subarray into the desired pattern.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the `make_stairs` function where the `start_index` is not defined within the function scope. This should be passed as a parameter to `make_stairs` to ensure it works correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is **not** correct as it stands because the `make_stairs` function does not have access to the `start_index` variable. This will lead to a `NameError` when the function is called.

**Correctness: False**
