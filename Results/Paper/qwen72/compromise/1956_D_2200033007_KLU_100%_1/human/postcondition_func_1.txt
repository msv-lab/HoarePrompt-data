The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and a list `arr` of integers. It returns a list of tuples representing specific segments of the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`. If the sublist contains a single element that is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If the maximum value in the sublist is equal to the square of the sublist's length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`. If no such conditions are met, it recursively divides the sublist and returns the combined results of these recursive calls. If no valid segments are found, it returns an empty list.
