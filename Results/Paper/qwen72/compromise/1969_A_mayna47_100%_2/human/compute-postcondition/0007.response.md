Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from the input. It checks if for any index `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, the value `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns immediately. If no such index is found after checking all values, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not modify the values of `n` or `v` and does not return any value. **
