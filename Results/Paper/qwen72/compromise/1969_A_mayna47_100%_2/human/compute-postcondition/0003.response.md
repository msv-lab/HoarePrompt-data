The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` starts at 1, and the loop will iterate up to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as integers provided by the user**
