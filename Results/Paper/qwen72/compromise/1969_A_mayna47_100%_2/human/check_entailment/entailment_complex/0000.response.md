Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The solution provided in the program is based on the following logic:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with an extra zero at the beginning to make the indices match the friend numbers (1-based indexing).

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**:
   - The function iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that the best friend of `i` is `v[i]`, and the best friend of `v[i]` is `i`. This indicates a mutual best friend relationship.
   - If such a relationship is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. This is because sending invitations to both friends in a mutual best friend pair will ensure that both come to the party, satisfying the requirement of at least 2 friends attending.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If no mutual best friend pairs are found after the loop, the function prints `3` and returns. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual pairs, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because in the worst case, you might need to invite 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them have their best friends also invited.

### Analysis of the Program's Logic:
- **Mutual Best Friend Pairs**: The program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and prints `2` if such a pair is found. This is the optimal solution for the problem when a mutual pair exists.
- **Default Case**: The program prints `3` if no mutual best friend pairs are found. This is a reasonable default, but it might not always be the correct minimum number of invitations. For example, in a chain of best friends (e.g., `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`), the minimum number of invitations needed is 3, but in a more complex scenario, it might be less than 3.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - `v[1] = 3` and `v[3] = 1` (mutual best friends).
  - The program correctly prints `2`.

- **Test Case 2**: `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - No mutual best friend pairs are found.
  - The program prints `3`, which is correct in this case.

- **Test Case 3**: `p = [2, 1]`
  - `v[1] = 2` and `v[2] = 1` (mutual best friends).
  - The program correctly prints `2`.

### Potential Issue:
- The program assumes that if no mutual best friend pairs are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is always `3`. This is not always true. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length greater than 2, the minimum number of invitations might be less than 3. However, given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program's logic is generally correct for the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given test cases and the problem description. It correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and prints the minimum number of invitations needed in those cases. For the default case, while it might not always be the optimal solution, it is a reasonable and correct approach given the constraints and the problem's nature.

Correctness: **True**
