Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 2. If the third character of `x` (i.e., `x[j - 1]`) is 'F', then `a[2]` is increased by 1. If the third character of `x` is 'S', then `b[2]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, both `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.***
