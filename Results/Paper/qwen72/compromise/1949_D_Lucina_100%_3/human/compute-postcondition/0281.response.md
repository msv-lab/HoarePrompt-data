Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is 2, and `nx` is a string. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is not `?`, `nx` is the character at position 0 of `xx[3]`. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
