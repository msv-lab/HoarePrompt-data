Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2, `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `1` of the list `b` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `j`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `b[1]` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
