The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, and `sa` is a list that includes the element 1. If `a[2]` is 0 and `b[2]` is 0, `sa` also includes the element 2.**
