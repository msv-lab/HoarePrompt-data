Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is a string with 'F' appended to its previous value.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[1]` to `a[n]`, `b[1]` to `b[n]`, `sa`, and `j` remain unchanged. The updated value of `nx` is a string with 'F' appended to its previous value.
