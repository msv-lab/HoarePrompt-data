Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 2, and `nx` is a string with either 'F' or 'S' appended to its previous value, depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.***
