Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is `n`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `xx.append(x)` adds the new input string `x` to the list `xx` as its last element.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The string `x` is now included in the list `xx`.
- The arrays `a` and `b` are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.
