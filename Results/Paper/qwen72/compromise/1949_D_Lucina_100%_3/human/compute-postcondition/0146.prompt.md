Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]` concatenated with the character at position 0 in `xx[1][0]`. Otherwise, if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]` followed by 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or followed by 'S' otherwise. If `xx[1][1]` is '?', `nx` is 'FF' if `n` is 8 or more, 'SF' if `n` is less than 8, 'FS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SS' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is either increased by `xx[1][2]` if `xx[1][2]` is not '?', or `nx` is appended with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or `nx` is appended with 'S' otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
