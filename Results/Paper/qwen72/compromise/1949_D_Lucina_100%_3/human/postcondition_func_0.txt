The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters. The characters can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the input matrix is symmetric with the diagonal always being '.'. The function processes the input matrix to determine the positions of 'F' and 'S' based on the cumulative counts of these characters in each row and column. It then updates the '?' characters in the matrix based on the following rules: If the number of positions with 'F' (but no 'S') is greater than or equal to the number of positions with 'S' (but no 'F'), the '?' characters in the first `n // 4 - 1` positions of the 'F' list are replaced with 'F', and the rest are replaced with 'S'. Otherwise, the '?' characters in the first `n // 4 - 1` positions of the 'S' list are replaced with 'S', and the rest are replaced with 'F'. The function prints the updated matrix.
