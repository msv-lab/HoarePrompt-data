### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Symmetry Check**:
   - The function correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters.
   - The input matrix is symmetric, and the diagonal elements are always '.', which is correctly handled.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
   - The function uses two arrays, `a` and `b`, to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
   - For each character in the input matrix, if it is 'F', it increments the count in `a` for both the row and column indices. Similarly, if it is 'S', it increments the count in `b`.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only 'F' or Only 'S'**:
   - The function creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions, respectively.
   - This step is crucial for determining which scenarios have already been decided and which need to be filled in.

4. **Updating '?' Characters**:
   - The function checks if the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions (`len(sb)`).
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it appends scenarios with no transitions to `sa` and updates the '?' characters in the matrix:
     - The first `n // 4 - 1` positions in `sa` are set to 'F'.
     - The rest of the '?' characters are set to 'S'.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it appends scenarios with no transitions to `sb` and updates the '?' characters in the matrix:
     - The first `n // 4 - 1` positions in `sb` are set to 'S'.
     - The rest of the '?' characters are set to 'F'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the updated matrix, ensuring that the diagonal elements remain '.' and the symmetry is maintained.

### Issues:
- **Index Out of Range**:
  - The function uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the number of initial transitions to set. However, this can lead to an index out of range error if `n // 4 - 1` is negative or if the number of scenarios in `sa` or `sb` is less than `n // 4 - 1`.
  - For example, if `n = 5`, `n // 4 - 1` is `0`, which means the function will try to access `sa[:0]` or `sb[:0]`, which is an empty list. This can cause issues when trying to set transitions.

- **Transition Limit**:
  - The function does not explicitly check if the resulting sequence of transitions for any permutation of scenarios will have more than `ceil(3n/4)` consecutive transitions of the same type.
  - The logic of setting the first `n // 4 - 1` transitions to one type and the rest to the other type does not guarantee that the transition limit will be met for all permutations.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the potential index out of range error and the lack of a guarantee that the transition limit will be met for all permutations, the program is not correct.

### Correctness: **False**
