### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which contains the partial transition video plan, and updates the `a` and `b` lists based on the characters 'F' and 'S' in the input.

2. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through the scenarios and appends the scenario index to `sa` if it has at least one funny transition and no scary transitions, and appends to `sb` if it has at least one scary transition and no funny transitions.

3. **Handling Unassigned Transitions:**
   - The program checks which list (`sa` or `sb`) is longer. This is to ensure that the program can balance the number of funny and scary transitions.
   - If `sa` is longer or equal to `sb`, it appends scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
   - It then iterates through the scenarios again to construct the final transition matrix `nx`:
     - If the transition is already known (i.e., not '?'), it keeps the same value.
     - If the transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, it assigns 'F'.
     - Otherwise, it assigns 'S'.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final transition matrix `nx` for each scenario.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program attempts to balance the transitions by assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest. However, this approach might not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are played.
  - The logic for balancing transitions is not robust enough to handle all permutations of scenarios and ensure the constraint is met.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is exactly \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\). In such cases, the logic for appending to `sa` or `sb` might not work as intended.

- **Symmetry:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input in a symmetric manner and updating the matrix accordingly. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for balancing the transitions is not sufficient to guarantee that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is always met. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
