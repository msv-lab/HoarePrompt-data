Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to it.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `vt`) remain unchanged.
- `kq1` is now a string that contains the value of `x`.
