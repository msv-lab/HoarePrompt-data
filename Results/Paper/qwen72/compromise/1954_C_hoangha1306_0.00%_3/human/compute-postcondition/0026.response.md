Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0, the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, and the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0 and the first character of `a` is less than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
