Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `vt` is 1. If `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `kq1` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the character representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is a string containing the character representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.***
