Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `b` is the new input string, `vt` is 0, `kq1` is an empty string, and `kq2` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are new input strings with at least 1 character, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `vt` is updated to 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of the maximum and minimum integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, respectively. If `vt` was already 1 before the if-else block, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the maximum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, and `kq2` is the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` were equal, or the string representation of the minimum integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b` if they were not equal, followed by the third character of `a`. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[i]` == `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the third character of `a`. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` != 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
