Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the first character of `a` (or `b`), and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, and `i` is 1. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the second character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal), and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal) concatenated with the second character of `a`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then: if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to its previous value; otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` concatenated to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, and `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, `kq1` is the string containing the character at index 2 of `a`, and `kq2` is the string containing the character at index 2 of `a` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `kq1` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[2]` <= `b[2]`, `kq1` is a string containing the character representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is a string containing the character representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, and `kq2` is a string containing the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
