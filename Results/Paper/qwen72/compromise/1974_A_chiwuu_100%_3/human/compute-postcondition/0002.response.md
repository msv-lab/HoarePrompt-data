Output State: **For each test case, the value of `t` is adjusted based on the input values `a` and `b` such that `t` is the minimum number of 15-minute intervals needed to cover the difference `a - t1` (where `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`), ensuring that `t1` is at least `a`. The final value of `t` for each test case is printed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
