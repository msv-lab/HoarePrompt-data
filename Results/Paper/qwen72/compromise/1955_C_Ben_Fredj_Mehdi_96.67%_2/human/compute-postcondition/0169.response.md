An exception in the given `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. When attempting to access `a[g]` or `a[d]` if `g` or `d` are out of the valid index range for the list `a`.
2. When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer if the elements at these indices are not valid integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the element at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs during this process, the `except` block will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If no exception occurs, the elements at indices `g` and `d` in `a` are decremented by 1. If the element at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and no changes are made to `a`, `g`, or `d`.**
