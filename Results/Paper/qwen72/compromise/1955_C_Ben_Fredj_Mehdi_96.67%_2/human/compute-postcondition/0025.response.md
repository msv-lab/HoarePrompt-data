Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is not equal to 99999999999.
   - `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
   - `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
   - The first element of `a` is not equal to 1.
   - `k` is not equal to 9999999999.
   - `n` is not equal to 101 or `k` is not equal to 100000000000.
   - The current value of `k` is 10000000000000.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('10000')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'10000'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'10000'`.

Output: **10000**
