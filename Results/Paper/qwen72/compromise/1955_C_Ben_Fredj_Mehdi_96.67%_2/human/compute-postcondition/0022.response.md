The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('1')
```

This code simply prints the string `'1'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a` and is currently 101.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and is currently 100000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
- `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not equal to 1.
- `k` is not equal to 9999999999.

Since the `print` statement is printing a constant string `'1'`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
