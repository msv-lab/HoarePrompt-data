An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` if `g` is out of bounds of the list `a`.
2. `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` if `d` is out of bounds of the list `a`.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at the indices `g` and `d` of the list `a`. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the `except` block will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1. If the `try` block executes without exceptions, `a[0]` is the first integer in `a` minus 1, and `a[d]` is the last integer in `a` minus 1. If `a[0]` is 0 after decrementing, `g` is updated to 1. If the last element of `a` is 0 after decrementing, `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
