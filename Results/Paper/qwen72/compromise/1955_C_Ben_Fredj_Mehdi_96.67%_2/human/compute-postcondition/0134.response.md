Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `a`.
- An error occurs.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('10000')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'10000'`.
- The initial state mentions that an error occurs, but it does not specify where the error occurs. If the error occurs before the `print` statement, the `print` statement will not be executed, and nothing will be printed.
- However, if the error occurs after the `print` statement, the `print` statement will still execute and print the string `'10000'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state does not provide specific information about where the error occurs, we must assume that the `print` statement will execute if the error does not prevent it. Therefore, the output will be the string `'10000'`.

Output: **10000**
