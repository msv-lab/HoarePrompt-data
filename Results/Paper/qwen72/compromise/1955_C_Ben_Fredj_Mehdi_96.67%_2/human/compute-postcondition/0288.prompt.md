Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the user, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `k` is 1999999999, 99999999999, 9999999999, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 19999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, and `n` is 2, or if `n` is 2 and `k` is not 2147483648, or if `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, or if `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, or if `k` is 5999999999, 4294967295, or if `n` is 2 and `k` is `a[0] - 1` and `k` is also `a[1] - 2`, or if `k` is 3000000000 or `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `k` is an even number and none of the above conditions are met, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`, `g` is the number of times the first element of `a` has been decremented to 0, and `d` is the number of times the last element of `a` has been decremented to 0. If `k` is an odd number and none of the above conditions are met, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. If `k` is 1999999998, an error occurs. If `k` is 1999999999, an error occurs. If `k` is one of the values 99999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 100000000000, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 3000000000, 199999999999999, 2147483648 with the first element of `a` being 2, or 4294967295, an error occurs. If `k` is 2147483648 and the first element of `a` is 2, the state of `a` and `g` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 1999999998, not 1999999999, not 2147483648 with the first element of `a` being 2, and `k` is less than the sum of the list `a`, `k` must be at least 2. In this case, the first element of `a` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times the loop executed, and `i` is `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is an odd number, the element at index `g` in `a` is decremented by 1, and if this element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `k` is an even number, the state of `a` and `g` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, and `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space. If `k == 1999999998`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 1999999999, 99999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 99999999999999, or if `n == 1` and `k == 10000000000000` and `a[0] == 1`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than 3000000000, less than the sum of all integers in `a`, and at least 2, and if `k` is odd, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1` (or the loop could have broken due to an exception), `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and `a[d]`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged. For all other values of `k`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
