Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('1')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'1'`.
   - The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output will be the string `'1'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
