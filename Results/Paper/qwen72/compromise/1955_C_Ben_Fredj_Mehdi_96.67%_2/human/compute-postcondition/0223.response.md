Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'2'`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement, which is the string `'2'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
