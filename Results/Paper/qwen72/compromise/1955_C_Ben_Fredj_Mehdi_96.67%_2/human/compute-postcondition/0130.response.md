Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `a`.
- An error occurs.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('99')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'99'`. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, and `n` do not affect the execution of this `print` statement because it is a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **99**
