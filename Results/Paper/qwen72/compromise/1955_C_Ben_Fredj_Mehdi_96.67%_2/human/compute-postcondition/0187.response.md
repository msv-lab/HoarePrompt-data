Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, and an error occurs. If `n` is 2, `k` is `a[0] - 1`, and `k` is `a[1] - 2`, the error occurs. If `n` is not 2 or `k` does not satisfy both `k == a[0] - 1` and `k == a[1] - 2`, and `k` is 3000000000, an error occurs. If `k` is not 3000000000 and is greater than or equal to the sum of the list `a`, an error occurs. If `k` is less than the sum of the list `a`, `k` must be at least 2, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times the loop executed, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `k` is an even number, the state of `a` and `g` remains unchanged.***
