Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('5')` statement is executed.

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `a`.
- An error occurs.

Given the `print('5')` statement, the output is straightforward. The string `'5'` is printed, and the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The error mentioned in the initial state does not impact the execution of the print statement, as the print statement is a simple output of a constant string.

Output: **5**
