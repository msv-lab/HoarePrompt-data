Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is not 20 or `k` is not 10000000000, the state of the variables remains unchanged if `k` is 5999999999, 4294967295, or if `n` is 2 and `k` is `a[0] - 1` and `k` is also `a[1] - 2`, or if `k` is 3000000000 or `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`, `g` is the number of times the first element of `a` has been decremented to 0, and `d` is the number of times the last element of `a` has been decremented to 0. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
