Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. Specifically, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the last digit in the list of digits is greater than any letter in the list of letters, which is not the correct way to ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the password. Instead, the program should check that all letters come before any digits and that both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    for i in range(len(letters), len(password)):
        if password[i].isalpha():
            return False
    
    return True
```

This version ensures that:
1. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. No digit comes after a letter in the password.

With these checks, the program will correctly determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.
