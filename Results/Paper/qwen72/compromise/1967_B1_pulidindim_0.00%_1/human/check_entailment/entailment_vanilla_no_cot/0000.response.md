Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs is not simply `n` plus some additional count. The correct initialization should be `0`.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - The loop starts from `count = 2` and increments `count` by 1 until it exceeds `m`. This is a good start, but the calculation inside the loop is flawed.
   - The variable `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, which is used in the condition `g < countmins`. This condition is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The calculation `g = n / count` and `g -= countmins` is incorrect. The variable `g` should be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, not a division of `n` by `count`.
   - The line `ans += g / count + 1` is also incorrect. The correct approach involves checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` and counting such pairs.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), you need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) can be calculated using the `math.gcd` function.
   - The condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) should be checked for each pair.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition using the gcd function. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `ans`.

### Example:
For the input:
```
6
1 1
2 3
3 5
10 8
100 1233
1000000 1145141
```

The output should be:
```
1
3
4
14
153
1643498
```

The provided program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
