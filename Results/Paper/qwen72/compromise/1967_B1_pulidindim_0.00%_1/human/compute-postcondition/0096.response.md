Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then performs a series of calculations to compute a value `ans` based on `n` and `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. After all iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
