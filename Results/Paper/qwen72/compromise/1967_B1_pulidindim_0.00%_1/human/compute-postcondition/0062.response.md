To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `count` is `m + 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration.
   - `countmins` is `m - 1`.
   - `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `m` are user-provided values.
   - `t` is a value greater than 1, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `i` starts at 1 and is likely incremented in a loop.
   - `count` is `m + 1`, which means it is one more than the value of `m`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` and a series of values added in each iteration of a loop.
   - `countmins` is `m - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / m - (m - 1)`.
   - The loop breaks if `g` is less than `countmins`.

3. **Determining the Value of `ans`:**
   - The exact series of values added to `ans` is not provided, but we know that `ans` starts with `n` and is incremented by some values in each iteration.
   - The loop condition is that `g` must be greater than or equal to `countmins` for the loop to continue.
   - The loop iterates `i` from 1 to `count` (which is `m + 1`).

4. **Calculating `g` and `countmins`:**
   - `g` is calculated as `n / m - (m - 1)`.
   - `countmins` is `m - 1`.

5. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will break if `g < countmins`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `n / m - (m - 1) >= m - 1`.

6. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - Since the exact values added in each iteration are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the initial value `n` and the series of values added.
   - The loop will run for `m + 1` iterations, and in each iteration, some value is added to `ans`.

7. **Output:**
   - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` and the values added in each iteration of the loop.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the sum of n and the values added in each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs for m + 1 iterations)**
