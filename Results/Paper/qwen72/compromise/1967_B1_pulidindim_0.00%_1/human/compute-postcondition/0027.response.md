Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is equal to `n / 5 - 4`. If `g` < `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from it.
- `g` is now equal to `n / 5 - 4`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if g < countmins` is still valid and will determine whether to break out of the loop or if statement.
