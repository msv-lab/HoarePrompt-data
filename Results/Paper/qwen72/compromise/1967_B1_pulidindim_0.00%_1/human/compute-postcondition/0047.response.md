Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is equal to `n / 3`. `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`. Since `count` is 3, `g` is now equal to `n / 3`.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain as provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
