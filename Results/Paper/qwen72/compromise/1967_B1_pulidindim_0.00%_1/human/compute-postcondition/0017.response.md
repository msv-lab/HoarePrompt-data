Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is equal to `n / 4`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
