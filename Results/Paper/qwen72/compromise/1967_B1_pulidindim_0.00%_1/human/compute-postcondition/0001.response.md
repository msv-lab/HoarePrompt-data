The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `m` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
