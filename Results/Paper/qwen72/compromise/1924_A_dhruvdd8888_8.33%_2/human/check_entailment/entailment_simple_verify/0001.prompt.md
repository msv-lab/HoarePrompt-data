You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The loop prints a string for each character in the set `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the current character from `us` and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window and an empty list `ans` to store the characters that form a valid subsequence.

2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the size of `win` equals `k`, it means that all `k` characters have been seen in the current window. The program then adds `i` to the list `ans`, increments the count `ps` by 1, and clears the set `win`.

3. **Checking Subsequence Condition:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if the count `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it means that there are at least `n` valid subsequences, and the program prints `YES`.
   - If `ps < n`, it means that not all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences, and the program prints `NO`.

4. **Generating a Missing Subsequence:**
   - If the program prints `NO`, it attempts to generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It iterates through the set `us` and finds a character `i` that is not in the set `win`.
   - It then constructs a string by appending the characters in `ans`, the missing character `i`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` additional `a` characters to ensure the string is of length `n`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
  - The program only checks if there are `n` valid subsequences of length 1 (each character in `us` appearing at least once in `s`), but it does not check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
  - For example, in the second test case, the program should check if all possible strings of length 2 (aa, ab, ba, bb) are subsequences of `s`, not just if each character appears at least once.

- **Generating a Missing Subsequence:**
  - The logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It appends characters to `ans` and then adds a missing character and additional `a` characters, which does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.
  - The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only checks if each character in `us` appears at least once in `s` and does not verify if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Additionally, the logic for generating a missing subsequence is incorrect.
