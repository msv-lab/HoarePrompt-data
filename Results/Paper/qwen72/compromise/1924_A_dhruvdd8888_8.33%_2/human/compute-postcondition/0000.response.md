Output State: **The function should take three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values of the next three inputs, which are integers.**
