The code snippet `r()` calls the lambda function `r` which reads input and returns a map object of integers. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `queries`) but creates a new map object which is the result of reading the input.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query. A new map object of integers is created from the input.**
