Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about the distances between specific pairs of cities. For each test case, it reads the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It then calculates and prints the cumulative sums of certain conditions based on the distances between consecutive city positions. Finally, it processes each query by calculating and printing the distance between the specified cities. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all input has been consumed and all results have been printed. **
