To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.
2. `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.
3. `c` is less than `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `u`:**
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. This means `u` could be any integer except 0. For example, if `u` was initially 5, then `u` would be 4 after being decreased by 1.

2. **Understanding `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. The function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it returns two values where `c` is less than `d`.

3. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement accesses elements from the list `b` using indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - It then subtracts the value at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the value at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `b` is a list, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.
- `c` and `d` are integers where `c < d`.

### Calculation:
- The index for `d` is `(d - 1) * 2`.
- The index for `c` is `(c - 1) * 2`.
- The `print` statement will output the difference between the values at these indices in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the list `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list, c and d are integers such that c < d)**
