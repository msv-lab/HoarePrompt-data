Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 3, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is now `[0, 0]` (unchanged); `u` is 0; `c` and `d` are the last two elements returned by the function `r()` before `u` became 0.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 3, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is now `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`; `u` is 0; `c` and `d` are the last two elements returned by the function `r()` before `u` became 0; `v` is the difference `y - x` for some pair (x, y) in `queries`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 5 elements; `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 3, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is now [0, 0, v1, v2, v1 + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list starting with the second element of the previous `a` (produced by `r()`), followed by the unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 3, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is `[0, 0, v1, v2, v1 + v, v2 + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
