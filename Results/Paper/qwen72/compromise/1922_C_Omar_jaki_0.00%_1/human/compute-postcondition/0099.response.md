The code assigns the values returned by the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `r()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`. However, the value of `u` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a non-zero value decreased by 1.

Output State: **`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.**
