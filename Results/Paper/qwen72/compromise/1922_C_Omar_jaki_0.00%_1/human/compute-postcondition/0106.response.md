The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged, and the condition that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`, otherwise `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, still holds true.

Output State: **`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 2, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
