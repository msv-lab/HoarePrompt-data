To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 3.
2. `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by the function `r()`.
3. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `u`:**
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 3. This means `u` could be any non-zero value minus 3. For example, if `u` was initially 5, then `u` would be 2. However, the exact value of `u` is not needed for the `print` statement.

2. **Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by the function `r()`. The function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that:
     - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c < d`.
     - If `c` is not less than `d`, then `c >= d`.

3. **List `b`:**
   - The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we do not know the exact values of the elements in `b`.

4. **Expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`:**
   - This expression calculates the difference between the element at index `c * 2 - 1` and the element at index `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.
   - Since the values of `c` and `d` are not known, and the list `b` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of this expression.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `c`, `d`, and the list `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `b` is a list whose elements are not specified)**
