Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 2, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements remaining; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `v` is assigned the value `y - x`; `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v`.**
