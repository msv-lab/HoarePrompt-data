Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query; `b` is a list `[0, 0]`.**
