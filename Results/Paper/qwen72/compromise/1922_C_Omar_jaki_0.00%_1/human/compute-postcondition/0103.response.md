To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.
- `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.
- `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `u`:**
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. This means `u` could be any integer except 0. For example, if `u` was initially 5, then after being decreased by 1, `u` would be 4.

2. **Understanding `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. The function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it returns some values. However, the precondition states that `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

3. **Understanding `b`:**
   - The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to assume that `b` is a list with at least enough elements to access indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.

4. **Calculating the Indices:**
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will be valid indices in the list `b`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `print` statement calculates the difference between the elements at indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the list `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are values returned by r() and c is greater than or equal to d)**
