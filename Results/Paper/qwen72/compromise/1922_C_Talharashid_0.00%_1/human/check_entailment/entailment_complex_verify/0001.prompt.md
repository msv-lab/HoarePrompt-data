You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed the minimum distance between the cities represented by the indices x_i and y_i. The variables t, n, lst, m, d1, d2, start, end, inc, and s have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values are not relevant to the output state. The initial state of the input variables (t, n, lst, m, x_i, y_i) remains unchanged as they are read from input for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers in ascending order, representing the positions of cities. It then reads an integer `m` and a list of `m` queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing two different cities. For each query, the function calculates and prints the minimum distance between the two cities, considering the distances in both directions (forward and backward) along the list of cities. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. The initial state of the input variables (t, n, lst, m, x_i, y_i) remains unchanged as they are read from input for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `lst`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the start to each city and from the end to each city, respectively.
   - The program iterates from the first city to the last city (`start` to `end`), calculating the minimum distance to the next or previous city and updating the cumulative cost in `d1`.
   - Similarly, it iterates from the last city to the first city (`start` to `end`), calculating the minimum distance to the next or previous city and updating the cumulative cost in `d2`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the starting city `start` and the ending city `end`.
   - It adjusts the indices to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each.
   - It calculates the minimum cost to travel from `start` to `end` using the precomputed cumulative costs in `d1` and `d2`.
   - The program prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the closest city by comparing the distances to the next and previous cities.
   - The cumulative cost is computed by adding 1 coin for moving to the closest city and the actual distance for moving to any other city.
   - The program ensures that the closest city is unique by the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the starting city is the first or last city in the list.
   - It correctly handles the case where the starting city index is greater than the ending city index.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently precomputes the cumulative costs in `d1` and `d2` in O(n) time.
   - Each query is handled in O(1) time by using the precomputed costs.

7. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the minimum number of coins required for each query.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- The program initializes `mini` with a large value `11111111`, but it should be `float('inf')` to ensure it works correctly for all possible input values, including very large distances.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct, but it has a minor issue with the initialization of `mini`. This can be fixed by using `float('inf')` instead of `11111111`.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the program:
