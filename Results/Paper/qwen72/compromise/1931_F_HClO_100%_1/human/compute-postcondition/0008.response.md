The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- If `m` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

After executing the code:
- `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the input.

The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
