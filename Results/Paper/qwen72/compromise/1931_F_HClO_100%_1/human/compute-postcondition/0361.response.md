The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is either 0 or 1
- `p2` is either 0 or 1
- `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1
- `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`)
- `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a3` is either undefined or the first integer from the new input line
- `l3` is either undefined or a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`
- `_` is 0
- `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`)
- `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`)
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `a3` is assigned the first integer from the new input line.
- `l3` is assigned a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`), `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`), `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
