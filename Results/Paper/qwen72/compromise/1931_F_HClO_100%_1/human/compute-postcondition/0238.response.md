The code appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially contains one or two tuples, after appending, `val` will contain two or three tuples.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing two or three tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input, `_` is 1.**
