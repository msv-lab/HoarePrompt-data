The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input. However, since no variable is assigned the result of `input()`, the input itself does not affect the state of the program. The values of `_` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, and the program waits for user input.**
