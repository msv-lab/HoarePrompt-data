To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is that `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

### New State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged)

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, all `m - 2` lines of input have been consumed. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
