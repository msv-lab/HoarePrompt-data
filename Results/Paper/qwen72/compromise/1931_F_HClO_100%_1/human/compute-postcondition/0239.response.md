The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop is controlled by the value of `m`, specifically, the loop will execute if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `m` is greater than 2, the condition `_ < m - 2` will still hold true if `m` is at least 4.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing two or three tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input, `_` is 2**
