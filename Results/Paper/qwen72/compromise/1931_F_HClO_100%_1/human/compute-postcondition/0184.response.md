Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is 1, and the program continues execution normally unless `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. Otherwise, `idx2` is 1, `p2` is 1, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1 < 0` or `idx2 < 0`, the program continues execution normally.***
