Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value.
- `_` is `m - 1`.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
- `m` is a new input integer greater than 2.
- `a1` is the first integer from the initial input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the initial input.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- The loop has executed `m - 1` times.
- `m - 1` input operations have occurred.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration.
- `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input.
- If any `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.
- Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.
- An additional input operation has occurred, but the input value is not stored.

Given this state, the `print('yes')` statement will execute after the loop has completed without breaking. Since the loop only breaks if any `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, and it did not break, the condition for printing 'yes' is met.

Output: **yes**
