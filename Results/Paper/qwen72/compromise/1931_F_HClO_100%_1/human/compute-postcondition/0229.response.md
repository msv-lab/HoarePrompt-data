Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` now contains `a1` inserted at position `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` now contains `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`.**
