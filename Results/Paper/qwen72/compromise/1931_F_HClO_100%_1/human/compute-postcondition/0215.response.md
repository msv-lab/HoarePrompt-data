Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n - 3`, `l` is now a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is now a reference to the list `l1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n - 3` remains valid.
