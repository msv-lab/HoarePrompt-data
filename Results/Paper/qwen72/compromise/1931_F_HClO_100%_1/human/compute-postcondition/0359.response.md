Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`), `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is either undefined or the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is either undefined or a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`), `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
