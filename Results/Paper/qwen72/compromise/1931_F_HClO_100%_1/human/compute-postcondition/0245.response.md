Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`
- `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions
- `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a3` is the first integer from the last user input
- `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the last user input
- `_` is `m - 3`
- The list `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
