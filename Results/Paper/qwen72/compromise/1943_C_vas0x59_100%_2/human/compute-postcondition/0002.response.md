The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state must ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
