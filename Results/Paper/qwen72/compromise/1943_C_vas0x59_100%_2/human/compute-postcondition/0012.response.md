Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1999, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]` and any previous values, and `u2vs[v]` contains `[u]` and any previous values; `u` is updated to the integer provided by the user input minus 1; `v` is updated to the integer provided by the user input minus 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `u` is updated to the integer provided by the user input minus 1.
- The value of `v` is updated to the integer provided by the user input minus 2.
- The list `u2vs[u]` is appended with the value of `v`.
- The list `u2vs[v]` already contains `[u]` and any previous values, and this remains unchanged.
- The rest of the structure of `u2vs` remains the same.
