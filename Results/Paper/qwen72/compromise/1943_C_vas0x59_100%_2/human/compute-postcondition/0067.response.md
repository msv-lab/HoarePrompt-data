The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple to the list `ops`. The new tuple consists of the value of `c2` and the value of `i`, which is 5. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list and having at least 10 elements, `n` is -1, `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`, which is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci1`, `c2` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci2`, `i` is 5, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**
