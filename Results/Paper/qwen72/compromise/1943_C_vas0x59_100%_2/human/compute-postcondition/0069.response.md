Postcondition: ***`path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is set to `ci`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci1`, `c2` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci2`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` values from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.***
