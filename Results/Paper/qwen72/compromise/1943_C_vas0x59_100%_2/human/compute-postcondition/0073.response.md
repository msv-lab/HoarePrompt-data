The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree, where `u2vs[u]` is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`. The function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input, constructs an adjacency list for the tree, and returns `None`.**
