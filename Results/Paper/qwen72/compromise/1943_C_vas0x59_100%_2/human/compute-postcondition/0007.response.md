The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Given the initial state, `u` and `v` are both decreased by 1, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists. The specific impact is that the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value of `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` now contains `[u]` (in addition to any previous values); `u` is decreased by 1; `v` is decreased by 1.**
