Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **t**: A positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This variable is not directly used in the code snippet, but it indicates the range of possible input values.
2. **n**: The input integer, which is the same as `t`.
3. **ar**: A list of integers with at least 2 elements.
4. **i**: Equal to the length of `ar`.
5. **same**: The count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.
6. **minn**: The minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is not equal to infinity.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(minn)
```

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This is the length of the list `ar`. For example, if `ar` is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `i` would be 5.
- **`same`**: This is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`. For example, if `ar` is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `same` would be 3 because the last sequence of consecutive equal elements is `[3, 3, 3]`.
- **`minn`**: This is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must have a finite value. The exact value of `minn` depends on the previous state of the program, but it will be the minimum of the current `same` and the previous `minn`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `ar` is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
  - `i` would be 5.
  - `same` would be 3.
  - If the previous `minn` was 4, then `minn` would be updated to `min(4, 3)`, which is 3.
- Suppose `ar` is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
  - `i` would be 5.
  - `same` would be 2.
  - If the previous `minn` was 3, then `minn` would be updated to `min(3, 2)`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
The `print(minn)` statement will print the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of the previous minn and the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list ar)**
