Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The input value `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
   - The current value of `minn` is equal to `inf` (which stands for infinity).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but the `print` statement does not use any of these variables or objects. It is printing a constant value.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
