The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of an integer input value `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and the loop will execute again if `_` is still less than `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- The input value `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially equal to infinity, `minn` remains infinity. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to infinity.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `_` must be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue if `_` is still less than `t`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**

This means:
- `_` is now `_ + 1`.
- The loop will execute again if `_ + 1` is less than `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
