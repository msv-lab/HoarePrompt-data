The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as it represents the number of test cases (t). The variable `_` itself does not need to be adjusted, as it is a temporary variable used in the loop. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring that it is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration**
