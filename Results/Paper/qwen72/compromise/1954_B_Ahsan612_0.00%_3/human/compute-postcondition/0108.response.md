The value of `num` is updated to the value of `ar[i]`, where `i` is 5. Therefore, `num` is now equal to the sixth element of the list `ar`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 5, `len(ar)` is greater than 4. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1. `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, and `minn` is 1, with the condition that the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
