To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to evaluate the condition in the `while` loop head: `i < len(ar)`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `ar` is a list of integers

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is 1, `ar` must have at least 2 elements (i.e., `len(ar) >= 2`) for the condition `i < len(ar)` to be true.

The state of `ar` is not explicitly given in terms of its length, but we can infer that it must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 1**
