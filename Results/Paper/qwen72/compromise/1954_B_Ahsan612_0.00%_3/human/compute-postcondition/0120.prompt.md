Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a in each test case is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was `inf`, then `minn` is now `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially equal to infinity, `minn` remains infinity. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by the number of iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar` and `same`, and `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`. If `minn` is `inf`, it indicates that there are no sequences of consecutive same numbers in `ar`. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to infinity.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
