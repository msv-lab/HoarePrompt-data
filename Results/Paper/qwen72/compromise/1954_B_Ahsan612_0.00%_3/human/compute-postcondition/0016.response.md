Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 or 3, `same` is 1 or 2, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was either 1 or 2, so after the increment, `i` is either 2 or 3.
- The values of `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `minn` being the minimum of its previous value and 1 still holds true.
- The conditions for `num` being equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar` are still valid, but the index `i` has been updated.
