Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`, and `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn` is still valid.
- The value of `same` is now explicitly 1.
