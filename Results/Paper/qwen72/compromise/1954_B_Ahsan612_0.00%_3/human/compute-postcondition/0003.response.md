Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `same` to 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `same` being set to 1.
