The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. Since `i` is 1 and `ar` has at least 2 elements, the condition `i < len(ar)` will be true, and the loop can proceed without any adjustments.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1**
