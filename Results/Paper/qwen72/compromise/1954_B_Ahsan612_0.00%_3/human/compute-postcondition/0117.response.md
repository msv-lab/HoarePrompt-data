Postcondition: **_ is incremented by the number of iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar` and `same`, and `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is not equal to infinity.**
