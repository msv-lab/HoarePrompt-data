Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1.**

The initial state is updated to reflect that `same` is now set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `same` and `minn` is not affected by this assignment, so they retain their initial values.
