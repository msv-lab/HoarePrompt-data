Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to the previous value of `num`. `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it is already set to 1 in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `i`, `minn`) remain the same as they were in the initial state. The condition that the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to the previous value of `num` is still valid. The value of `minn` is now the minimum of its previous value and 1, but since `minn` was already less than or equal to 1, it remains unchanged.
