Output State: **`i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is equal to `ar[4]`, `minn` is now the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1.** 

The value of `same` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `i` still being 4, `len(ar)` still being greater than 3, `num` still equal to `ar[4]`, and `minn` still being the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
