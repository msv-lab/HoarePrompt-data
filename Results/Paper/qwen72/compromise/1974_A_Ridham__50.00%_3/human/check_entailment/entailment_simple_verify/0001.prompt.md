You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is supposed to take two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(x, y):`.

    n = int(input())
    result = []

        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: The `result` list will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration, based on the input values of `x` and `y`. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, and each element in the list will be an integer representing the total number of screens required for the corresponding `x` and `y` values. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated for each iteration but are not retained after the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is an integer representing the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is then calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program uses:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and the remaining cells (7 cells) can be used for 1x1 icons.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Check for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are enough to place all 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`).
   - If yes, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If no, the program calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the remaining cells.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+1` ensures that if there are any leftover 1x1 icons, an additional screen is counted.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining cells for 1x1 icons is sound. The additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons are also calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
