Output State: **The `result` list will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration, based on the input values of `x` and `y`. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, and each element in the list will be an integer representing the total number of screens required for the corresponding `x` and `y` values. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated for each iteration but are not retained after the loop.**
