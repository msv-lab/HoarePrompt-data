Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `count` is 1, `done` remains False, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
