Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` (which is `s[0]`) is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j` (which is 0) and `done` remains False. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `done` remains False.***
