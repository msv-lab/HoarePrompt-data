Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each test case, it determines whether the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different in at least one of the substrings. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t` being 0, the last processed string, and various internal variables used during the processing. **
