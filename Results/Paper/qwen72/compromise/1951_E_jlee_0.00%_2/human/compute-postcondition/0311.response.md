The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is False. If `n` is odd and `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`, the program skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration. If `n` is even or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`, and if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program also skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration.**
