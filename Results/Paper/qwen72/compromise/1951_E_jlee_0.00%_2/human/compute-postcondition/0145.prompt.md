Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `count` is a non-negative integer. If `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there exists an index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was updated to `j`, and if `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`, `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `count` is updated to the largest index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `count` remains 1, `done` remains False, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1, `done` remains False, and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count` is 0, `count2` remains 0, and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is a non-negative integer, and `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True. If `count2` == `count` and `count` is 1 or less, `count2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `count` <= 0, `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is a non-negative integer, `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions, and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than 2. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the state of the variables remains unchanged, but the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
