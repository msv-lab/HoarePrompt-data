Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines the side length of the square. The program checks if the x-coordinates of certain pairs of points are equal and then calculates the side length based on the y-coordinates. However, this approach is not robust enough to handle all possible permutations of the corners of the square.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Corner Permutations**: The program only checks a few specific permutations of the corners (e.g., `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`). This means it will fail if the corners are given in a different order.
2. **Missing General Case**: The program does not handle the general case where the corners can be in any order. It should find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the area of the square, you should:
1. Collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. Find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes).
3. Square the difference to get the area.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x = []
        y = []
        for j in range(4):
            (xi, yi) = map(int, input().split())
            x.append(xi)
            y.append(yi)
        
        side_length = max(x) - min(x)  # or max(y) - min(y), both should be the same
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all permutations of the corners and compute the area of the square.
