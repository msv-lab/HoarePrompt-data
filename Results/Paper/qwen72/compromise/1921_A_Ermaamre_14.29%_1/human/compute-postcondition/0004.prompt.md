You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are given in random order, but it is guaranteed that they form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the square of the side length of the square formed by the given coordinates. The variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` and `res` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop depends on the last test case input. The variable `a` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and for each test case, four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
