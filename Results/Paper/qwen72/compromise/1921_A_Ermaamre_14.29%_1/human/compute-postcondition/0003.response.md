The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are given in random order, but it is guaranteed that they form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the area of the square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and for each test case, four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each test case.**
