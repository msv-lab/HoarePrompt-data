You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last one, is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. Each element in the list, except the last one, is set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element in the list is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`. The function modifies the value of `k` during its execution, but the final state of `k` is not relevant to the user as it is not returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the list and sets each element to the largest possible number with the highest bit set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Specifically, it sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
   - After setting each element, it subtracts the value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sum of the elements in `nums` should be equal to `k`.
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` should be maximized.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Sum of Elements:**
     - The loop sets each element to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - This value is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - The loop runs `n` times, and each time it subtracts the value from `k`.
     - After the loop, the remaining value of `k` is added to the last element.
     - Therefore, the sum of the elements in `nums` is indeed `k`.

   - **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
     - The bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k` if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
     - This is because the loop sets each element to the same value with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, and the bitwise OR of these values will have all those bits set to 1.
     - If `k` is not large enough to set all bits to 1 for `n` elements, the remaining value is added to the last element, ensuring that the highest possible bits are set to 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n = 1`):**
     - If `n = 1`, the function will set the single element to `k`, which is correct.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):**
     - If `n > 1`, the function will set each element to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, and the remaining value will be added to the last element.
     - This ensures that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.
