Postcondition: **After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. The list `s` will have been modified such that any consecutive '1's will be replaced with '-1' and '1' respectively, and any '0' that follows a '-1' will be set to '1'. The `flag` will be 1, indicating that the last bit checked was part of a consecutive '1' sequence, and the 30th element of `s` is '0'.**
