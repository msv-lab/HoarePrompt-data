Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 28. `flag` is 1, and either `s[i + 1]` is '0' or `s[i + 1]` is '1'. If `s[i + 1]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. If `s[i + 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '0', `s[i + 1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 0. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1'.**
