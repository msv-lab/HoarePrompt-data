Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state, and `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', '1', and '1' if the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` (where `i` is 2) results in a non-zero value. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0' or '1' followed by the strings '0', '0', and '1'.**
