The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range defined by `30`. Since the range is constant and does not change, we only need to adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'.**
