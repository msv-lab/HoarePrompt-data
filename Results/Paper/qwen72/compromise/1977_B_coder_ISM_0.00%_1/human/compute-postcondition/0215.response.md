The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` updates the value at index `i` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `s[2]` is updated to `'-1'`.

Here's the updated state:
- `x` is an input integer
- `t` is greater than 2
- `nalla` is 2
- `i` is 2
- `length` is 30
- `flag` is either 0 or 1
- `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. However, `s[2]` is now set to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29, but `s[2]` is now `'-1'`.**
