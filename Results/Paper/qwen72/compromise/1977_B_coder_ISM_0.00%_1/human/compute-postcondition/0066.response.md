Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. The list `s` will have been modified such that any consecutive '1's will be replaced with '-1' and '1' respectively, and any '0' that follows a '-1' will be set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list containing 31 strings, where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30, and `s[29]` is not '0'.***
