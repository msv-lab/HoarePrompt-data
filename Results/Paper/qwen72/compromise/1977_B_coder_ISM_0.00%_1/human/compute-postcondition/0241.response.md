Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29, with `s[29]` now set to '0'. If `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1', then `s[29]` is now '0' and `s[28]` remains '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` was '0' before this change, then `s[29]` is now '1' and `flag` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged.**
