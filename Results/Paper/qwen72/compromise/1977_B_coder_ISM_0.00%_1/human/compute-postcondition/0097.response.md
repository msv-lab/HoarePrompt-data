The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range defined by `30`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `length` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 is non-zero, `s` contains '1' followed by '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains '0' followed by '0'.**
