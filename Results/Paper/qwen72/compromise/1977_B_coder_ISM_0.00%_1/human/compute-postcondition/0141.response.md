Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 28. `flag` is 1, and the 29th element of `s` (index 29) is now '1'.**
