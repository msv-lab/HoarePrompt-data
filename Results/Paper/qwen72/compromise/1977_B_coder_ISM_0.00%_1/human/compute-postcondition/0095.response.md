Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by '0'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 2) is non-zero, `s` contains '1' followed by '0'. Otherwise, `s` contains '0' followed by '0'.**
