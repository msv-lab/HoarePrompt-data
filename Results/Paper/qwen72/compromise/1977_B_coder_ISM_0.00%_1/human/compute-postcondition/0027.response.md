Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, the string at position `i` in `s` is '1'. Otherwise, it is '0'. `flag` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '1', and the value of `s[i + 1]` is also '1'.**
