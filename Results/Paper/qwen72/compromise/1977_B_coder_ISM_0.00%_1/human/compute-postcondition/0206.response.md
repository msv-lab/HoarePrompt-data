Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, where `s[1]` is `'-1'`. If the first two elements of `s` were both '1' and `flag` was 0, then `s[0]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1 and the first element of `s` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1'. If none of these conditions are met, the state of `s[0]` remains unchanged.**
