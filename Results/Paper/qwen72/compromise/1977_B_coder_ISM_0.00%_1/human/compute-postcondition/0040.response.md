Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is set to '-1', `s[i + 1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is set to '0' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0, but `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', then `s[i]` remains '1' and `flag` remains 0.***
