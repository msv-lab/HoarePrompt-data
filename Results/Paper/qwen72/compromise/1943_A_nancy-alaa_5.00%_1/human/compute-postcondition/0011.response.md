Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This indicates the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This indicates the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\). This means each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
   - `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the code snippet.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. This list is used to create the `Counter` object `mpp`.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is True. This variable is not used in the code snippet.
   - `i` is a key in `mpp`, and the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. This means `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is a key in the `Counter` object `mpp` and that `mpp[i]` is 1. This means `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
