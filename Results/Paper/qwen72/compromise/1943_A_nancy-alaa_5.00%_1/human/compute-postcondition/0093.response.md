Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is False.
   - If `i` (which is 1) is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the value of `i`.
   - The condition about `i` being in the keys of `mpp` does not affect the `print` statement because it is not part of any loop or if statement that would prevent the `print` statement from executing.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
