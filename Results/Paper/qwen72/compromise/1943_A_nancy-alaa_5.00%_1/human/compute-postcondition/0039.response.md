Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n-1`. If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `first`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking the loop is still valid, as it depends on the values of `n-1` in `mpp` and the state of `first`.
