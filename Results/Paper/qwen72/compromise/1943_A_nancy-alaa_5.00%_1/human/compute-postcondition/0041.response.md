To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and the initial value of `i` should be 0 for the loop to start from the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `_` is 1
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `first` is False

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n):
```

To ensure the loop executes:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given).
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

The condition about `n-1` not being in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` being 1 and `first` being False is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0, and `first` is False**
