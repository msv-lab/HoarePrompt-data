Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then finds the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. The function prints this integer and terminates the processing for the current test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, an integer has been printed based on the conditions described. **
