Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is `False` if `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` was `True`. Otherwise, `first` remains `False`.
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to 1.
   - The variable `first` is initially `False`.
   - The `Counter` object `mpp` counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - The condition `if i not in mpp.keys()` checks if `i` (which is 1) is not in the keys of `mpp`. If this condition is true, the loop or if statement breaks.
   - The condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first == True` checks if the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and if `first` is `True`. If this condition is true, `first` is set to `False`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1, unless the loop or if statement breaks before reaching this point.
   - Since the initial state does not specify any loop or if statement that would break before printing `i`, and `i` is explicitly set to 1, the value of `i` will be printed.

Output: **1**
