The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate a fixed number of times based on the input value. The loop will execute one more time if the value of `_` is less than the input value. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if any integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and was encountered after the first such integer, otherwise `first` is False.**
