Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `_` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` is False.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 2. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
