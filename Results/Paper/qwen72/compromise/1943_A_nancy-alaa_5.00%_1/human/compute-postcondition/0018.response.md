Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `_` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `first` is False.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

### Output:
The value of `i` is 1.
Output: **1**
