Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `_` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `first` is `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

### Output:
Output: **1** (where `i` is the integer 1)
