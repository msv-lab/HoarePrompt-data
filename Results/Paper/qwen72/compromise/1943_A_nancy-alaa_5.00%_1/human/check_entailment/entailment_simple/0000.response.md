### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to achieve their goal.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice should always choose the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the array `a` to maximize the MEX of `c`. If no such integer exists, she should choose the smallest integer that appears more than once.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob should always choose the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the array `a` to minimize the MEX of `c`. If no such integer exists, he should choose the smallest integer that appears more than once.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `a` or that appears exactly once in `a` and is chosen by Alice first.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Counter Usage:** The `Counter` object `mpp` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - **First Turn Check:** The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has chosen an integer that appears exactly once in `a`.
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `a`, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen an integer that appears exactly once, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, it means Alice can choose this integer, and `first` is set to `True`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `a` or that appears exactly once and is chosen by Alice first.
   - However, it does not explicitly handle the case where all integers in `a` appear more than once. In such a case, the MEX should be `n` (since all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `a`).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
   - It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategies for both players. It correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
