Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` exactly once. In such a case, the MEX of the final array `c` should be `n`, but the current program will incorrectly print `n-1`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

Actual output from the program:
```
4
```

The program incorrectly breaks the loop when it encounters the last unique element, which should not happen if all elements from 0 to `n-1` are present. This is because the `first` flag is set to `True` after the first unique element is found, and the loop breaks when the next unique element is found, which is `n-1` in this case. The correct behavior should be to continue until all elements are processed and then print `n` as the MEX.
