Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The approach taken by the program is to count the number of '1's (`n`) and then, for each '0' that follows at least one '1', add `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). This is because each '0' that follows a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move it past all the '1's to the left, and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring including the '0' and all the '1's to its left.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of `func_1()`. The function does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted or where the string contains '1's followed by '0's that are not at the end of the string. Specifically, the function does not account for the possibility of needing to perform a cyclic shift on the entire string if it starts with '0's and ends with '1's, which would be the most efficient way to sort the string in such cases.

To illustrate, consider the test case `01101001`:
- The function will calculate `n` as 4 (the number of '1's).
- It will then add `n + 1` (5) to `ans` for each '0' that follows a '1', which happens 4 times.
- Therefore, the output will be `20`, but the correct output should be `11` because the optimal strategy involves fewer and more efficient shifts.

The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to move all '1's to the end of the string, which can be done by identifying the longest contiguous segment of '1's and calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's around this segment.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
