### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function processes a single binary string `s`.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the cost of sorting a binary string can be minimized by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, a cyclic shift of the substring containing all the '1's and the '0' is required.
   - The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's in the sequence.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost for sorting the string.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - It also handles the case where the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is O(|s|), where |s| is the length of the string.
   - The overall time complexity of `func_2` is O(t * |s|), where t is the number of test cases and |s| is the length of the string for each test case.
   - Given the constraints, this complexity is efficient and within the allowed limits.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
