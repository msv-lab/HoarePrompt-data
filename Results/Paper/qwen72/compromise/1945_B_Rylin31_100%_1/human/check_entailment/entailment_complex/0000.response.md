Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula is incorrect for the given problem.

### Explanation of the Problem:
- **Firework Launching:** The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
- **Visibility Duration:** Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- **Objective:** Determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the following:
1. **Firework Overlap:** Fireworks launched at different times can overlap if the difference between their launch times is less than or equal to `m`.
2. **Common Launch Times:** The installations can launch fireworks at the same time, which would count as two fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
- **Case 1:** If `a` and `b` are both 1, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m + 2` (since both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes).
- **Case 2:** Otherwise, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (one from each installation, as they can launch at the same time).

### Issues with the Given Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation:** The program uses `m // a + m // b + 2` to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the visibility duration `m + 1` and the overlap between fireworks.
- **Overestimation:** The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` overestimates the number of fireworks visible simultaneously. It counts the number of times each installation can launch a firework within `m` minutes and adds 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum simultaneous visibility.

### Correct Solution:
The correct solution should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == 1 and b == 1:
            print(m + 2)
        else:
            print(2)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Correctness: **False**
