You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers from the input, calculate the result based on the given conditions, and print either `-1` or the calculated result. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers from the input, which are expected to be in non-decreasing order. It then calculates a result based on these integers and prints either `-1` if the sum of the integers is odd, or a calculated value if the sum is even. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the total score of all three players is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - This formula works as follows:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the number of games played. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score is not achievable without invalid results.
     - The result is then divided by 2 to account for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If the scores are `0 0 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **Single Draw**: If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw is possible.
   - **Invalid Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Equal Scores**: If the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Valid Draws**: If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - **Large Difference in Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the maximum number of draws is 2.

The program handles all these cases and more, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly or `-1` is printed when the scores are invalid. Therefore, the program is correct.
