Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. This is correct because in any set of games where each game results in either 2 points (for a win) or 2 points (for a draw), the total sum of points must be even. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve the given scores, and the program correctly identifies this.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   - **Total Points Calculation**: The term `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` represents the total points scored by all three players.
   - **Adjustment for Imbalance**: The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is used to adjust for any imbalance in the scores. If `v[2]` (the highest score) is greater than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]` (the two lower scores), it means that the highest-scoring player has more points than the other two combined, which is impossible if all games are between pairs of players. The `max(0, ...)` ensures that this adjustment is non-negative.
   - **Divide by 2**: Since each draw contributes 2 points (1 point to each player), the total number of draws is the adjusted total points divided by 2.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the result is 0, which is correct.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the result is 1, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), and the result is -1, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the result is 2, which is correct.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), and the result is -1, which is correct.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the result is 6, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the result is 2, which is correct.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
