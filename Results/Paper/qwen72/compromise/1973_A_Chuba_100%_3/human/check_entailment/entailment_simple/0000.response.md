### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Looping**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input.

2. **Score Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid, and the program prints `-1`.
   - This is correct because the total number of points in a series of chess games (where each game results in either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw) must always be even. If the sum is odd, it means the scores are impossible to achieve with the given rules.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum number of draws is the total number of points divided by 2, minus the number of points that must be attributed to wins (since each win/loss game contributes 2 points).
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score cannot be achieved with the given rules, and the program correctly handles this by subtracting the excess points.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, either `-1` if the scores are invalid or the calculated maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output, checks for the validity of the scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
