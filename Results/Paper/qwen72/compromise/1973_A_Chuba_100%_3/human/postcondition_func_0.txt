The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers from the input, which are expected to be in non-decreasing order. It then calculates a result based on these integers and prints either `-1` if the sum of the integers is odd, or a calculated value if the sum is even. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed.
