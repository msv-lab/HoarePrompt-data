Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the placement of the `if ac > bc:` block. This block should be inside the loop that iterates over each test case, but it is placed outside, which means it only executes after all test cases have been processed, and it only prints the result for the last test case. To fix this, the `if ac > bc:` block should be indented to be within the loop that processes each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This version will correctly print the most frequent character for each test case.
