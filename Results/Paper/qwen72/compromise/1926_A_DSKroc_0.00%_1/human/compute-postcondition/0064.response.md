The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it processes a series of test cases. The input starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following `t` lines contains a distinct string of length 5, composed of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns the results for each test case based on the input strings.
