You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, with the constraint that no frequency value exceeds `k`. The original list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed if `k` is greater than the number of cards. This is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the hand. It correctly updates the frequency of each card number and caps it at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is a good optimization to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. **Output Logic**: 
   - If `k` is found in the frequency values of the cards, the program prints `k - 1`. This is based on the idea that if there are exactly `k` cards of the same number, you can perform an exchange operation and be left with `k - 1` cards.
   - If `k` is not found in the frequency values, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.

5. **Optimality Check**: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards. For example, if there are 10 cards with the same number and `k = 4`, you can perform the exchange operation multiple times to reduce the number of cards to 3. The current logic does not account for this.

6. **Correct Output for Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (5 3, 4 1 1 4 4), the correct output is 2, which the program produces.
   - For the second test case (1 10, 7), the correct output is 1, which the program produces.
   - For the third test case (7 2, 4 2 1 100 5 2 3), the correct output is 1, which the program does not produce.
   - For the fourth test case (10 4, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1), the correct output is 3, which the program does not produce.
   - For the fifth test case (5 2, 3 8 1 48 7), the correct output is 5, which the program produces.
   - For the sixth test case (6 2, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the correct output is 1, which the program does not produce.
   - For the seventh test case (6 3, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the correct output is 6, which the program produces.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the scenario where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further.
