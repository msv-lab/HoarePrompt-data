Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`. This part is correct.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is designed to create a frequency table of the card numbers, but it caps the frequency at `k` for each card number. This is a key point to consider:
   - The capping at `k` is done to avoid counting more than `k` cards of the same number, which is the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation.
   - However, the capping is not necessary for the correctness of the solution because the problem is to find the minimum number of cards left, not the maximum number of operations that can be performed.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no operation can be performed.
   - The program then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If `k` is found, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`.
   - If `k` is not found in the frequency table, the program prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing operations to reduce the number of cards.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of cards that can be removed in the operations. For each card number with a frequency of `f`, the number of cards that can be removed is `f // k * (k - 1)`.
   - The minimum number of cards left is `n - (total number of cards removed)`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

Correctness: **False**
