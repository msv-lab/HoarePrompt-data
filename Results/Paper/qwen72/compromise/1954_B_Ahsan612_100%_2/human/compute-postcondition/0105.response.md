The variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, and `ar` is a list that must have at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than the length of `ar`. Therefore, `ar` must have at least 6 elements for `i` (which is 5) to be less than `len(ar)`.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 6 elements, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`. If `ar[3]` is equal to `num` (the third element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is the fifth element of `ar`. `i` is 5**
