Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2, `num` remains the first element of `ar`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous `num` (which was `ar[0]`), and `minn` is 1.**
