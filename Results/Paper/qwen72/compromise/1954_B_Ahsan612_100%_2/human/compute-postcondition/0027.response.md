Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 2 or 3 if `ar[i-2]` == `num`, and `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` if `i` is 4, otherwise `same` is 1, and `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]` if `i` is 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 3, it is now 4, and if `i` was 4, it is now 5.
- The conditions for `same` and `num` are updated based on the new value of `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
