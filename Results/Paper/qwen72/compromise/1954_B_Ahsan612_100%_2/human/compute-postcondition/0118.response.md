Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` is an input integer (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `same` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `num` is the last element of `ar` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1.
   - `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

2. **Understanding `minn`:**
   - `minn` is initially some value.
   - It is updated to be the minimum of its original value and 1.
   - `minn` is not `inf` (infinity).
   - `minn` is not equal to the length of `ar`.

3. **Possible Values for `minn`:**
   - If the original `minn` was greater than 1, after the update, `minn` will be 1.
   - If the original `minn` was 1 or less, `minn` will remain the same.
   - Since `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`, it must be a finite integer that is not the length of `ar`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions, the most precise value for `minn` is 1, because the minimum of any finite number and 1 will always be 1, unless the original `minn` was already 1 or less, in which case it remains the same.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `minn`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
