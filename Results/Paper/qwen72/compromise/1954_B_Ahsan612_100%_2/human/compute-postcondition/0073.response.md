Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 1, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The list `ar` remains unchanged, as it is only read in the loop.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1 at the end of the loop, indicating that the last element of `ar` is considered as a single occurrence.
- The variable `num` is updated to the last element of `ar`, as the loop iterates through the entire list.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- The variable `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list `ar`. This is because `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the current `minn` and the count of consecutive equal elements (`same`) whenever a different element is encountered.
