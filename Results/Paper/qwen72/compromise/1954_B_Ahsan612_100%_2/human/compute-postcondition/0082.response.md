Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` remains the same. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `ar` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `same` remains 1.
- The value of `num` is updated to the last element of the new `ar` list.
- The value of `i` is updated to the length of the new `ar` list.
- The value of `minn` remains the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was either `inf` or equal to the length of the previous `ar`, it remains the same. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of the new `ar`.
