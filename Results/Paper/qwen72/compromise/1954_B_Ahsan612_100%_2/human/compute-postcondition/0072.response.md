Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, `same` is unchanged, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 3, it is now 4, and if `i` was 4, it is now 5.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged.
- The value of `same` remains unchanged.
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, but since `same` is unchanged, `minn` will remain the same if it was already less than or equal to `same`, or it will be updated to `same` if `same` was less than the previous `minn`.
