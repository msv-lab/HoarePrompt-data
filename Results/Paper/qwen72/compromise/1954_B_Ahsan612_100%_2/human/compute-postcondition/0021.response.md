Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`, `i` is 3 or 4, `minn` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- Since `minn` is initially 1 and `same` is either 1 or 2, the minimum value between `minn` and `same` is always 1.
- Therefore, `minn` remains 1.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`) retain their initial values.
