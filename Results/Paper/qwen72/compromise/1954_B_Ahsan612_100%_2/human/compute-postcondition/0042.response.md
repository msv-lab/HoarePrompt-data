Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of the new `ar`, `i` is `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. If `minn` was `inf` or `len(ar)`, then `minn` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `ar` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `num` is updated to the last element of the new `ar`.
- The value of `i` is updated to the length of the new `ar`.
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, following the conditions specified in the initial state.
