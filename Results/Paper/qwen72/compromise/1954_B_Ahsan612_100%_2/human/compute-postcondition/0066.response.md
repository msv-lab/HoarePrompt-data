Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, `same` is increased by 1, `num` is the integer at index `i-1` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `same` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged.
- The value of `num` is still the integer at index `i-1` in `ar`.
- The value of `minn` is still the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
