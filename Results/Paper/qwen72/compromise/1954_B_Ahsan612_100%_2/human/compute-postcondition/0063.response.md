Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 or 3, and `len(ar)` is greater than `i`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.***
