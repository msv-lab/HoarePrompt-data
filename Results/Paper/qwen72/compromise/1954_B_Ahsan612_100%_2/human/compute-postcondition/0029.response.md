Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 2 or 3 if `ar[i-2]` == `num`, and `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value (1) and the value of `same` (which is 2 or 3 if `ar[i-2]` == `num`). Since `minn` is initially 1, and the minimum of 1 and any value of `same` (2 or 3) is still 1, `minn` remains 1. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
