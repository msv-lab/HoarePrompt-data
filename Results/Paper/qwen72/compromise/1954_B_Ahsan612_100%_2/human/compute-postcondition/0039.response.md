Postcondition: **_ is 0, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is len(ar), and minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1. If minn is `inf` or `len(ar)`, then minn is updated to 1. Otherwise, minn remains the minimum value between the original minn and 1, and is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
