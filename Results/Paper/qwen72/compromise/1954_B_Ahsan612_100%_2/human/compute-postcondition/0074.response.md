Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- Since `same` is 1, `minn` will be the minimum value between the previous `minn` and 1.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`) remain unchanged.
