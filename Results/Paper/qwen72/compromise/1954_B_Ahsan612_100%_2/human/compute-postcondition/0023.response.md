Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` == `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, and `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, with `i` being 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, and `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`, with `i` being 3 or 4.**
