Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, and `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 2, it is now 3, and if `i` was 3, it is now 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
