### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a "beautiful" array, which means we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer "beautiful". If it's impossible, output `-1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final `same` count.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** If all elements are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array and prints `-1`.
   - **Single element array:** If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make the array empty, which is not beautiful. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is `inf` and prints `-1`.
   - **Mixed elements:** The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. However, the problem statement guarantees that the array is always beautiful, so this is not a concern.
   - The program correctly updates `minn` and handles the edge cases as described.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and problem description. It handles all the edge cases and the logic is sound.
