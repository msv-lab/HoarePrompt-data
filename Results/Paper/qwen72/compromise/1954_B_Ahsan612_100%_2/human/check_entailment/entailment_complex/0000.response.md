Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) with its neighbors if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` to skip the current element.
     - Updates `num` to the new current element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Correctness:
- **Handling All Identical Elements**:
  - If the array consists of all identical elements, `minn` will be equal to the length of the array, and the program correctly prints `-1`.
- **Finding Minimum Consecutive Identical Elements**:
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - For arrays of length 1, the program correctly prints `-1` because a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
  - For arrays where it is possible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, the program correctly finds the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Update of `i`**:
  - The line `i += 1` is inside the else block, which can cause the program to skip elements incorrectly. This can lead to incorrect counts of consecutive identical elements.
  - The correct approach should be to update `i` only once at the end of the loop.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                num = ar[i]
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical issue with the update of `i` inside the else block, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
