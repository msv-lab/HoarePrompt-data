Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. However, this does not directly solve the problem. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful, not just the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program increments `i` by 1 when it finds a different element, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely composed of the same element. It should check if the array is entirely composed of the same element and output `-1` if so.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, but it does not consider the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should identify that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) will make the array no longer beautiful.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. For `n = 1`, the array is trivially beautiful, and the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make a single-element array non-beautiful by removing elements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
