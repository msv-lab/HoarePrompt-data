Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means `x` is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
   - `num_tests` is decreased by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Understanding `start_year`:**
   - The variable `start_year` is defined as the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
   - To find this, we need to know the previous `start_year` and the last element in `nums`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(start_year)` will output the value of `start_year`.

Since the exact values of `nums` and the previous `start_year` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `start_year` in terms of these variables.

**Explanation:**
- Let's denote the last element of `nums` as `last_num`.
- The previous `start_year` is some integer value.
- The new `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `last_num` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

**Output:**
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element in nums that is greater than the previous start_year)**
