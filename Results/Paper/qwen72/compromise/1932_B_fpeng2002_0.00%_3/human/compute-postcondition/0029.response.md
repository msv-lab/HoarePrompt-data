Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `n`.
