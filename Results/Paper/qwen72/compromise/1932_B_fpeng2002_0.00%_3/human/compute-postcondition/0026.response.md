To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means `x` is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`.

2. **Understanding the Update Logic:**
   - For each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
   - This means that `start_year` will be adjusted to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `start_year` is initially some value `initial_start_year`.
   - For `x = 0`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `initial_start_year`.
   - For `x = 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the new `start_year`.
   - This process continues for each `x` in the range.

4. **Final Value of `start_year`:**
   - After iterating through all elements in `nums`, `start_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of all elements in `nums` and is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`.

Since the exact values of `nums` and the initial `start_year` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `start_year` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial start_year)**
