Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is added to the set `extra`.
- The values of `a`, `r`, `m`, `n`, `old`, and `todo` remain unchanged.
- The set `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`.
- The condition `len(done) >= k` and the variable `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.
