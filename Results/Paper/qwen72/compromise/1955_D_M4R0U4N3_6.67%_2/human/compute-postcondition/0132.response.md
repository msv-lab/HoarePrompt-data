Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
