Output State: **`r` is `n`, `m` is greater than 1, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[j]` and the previous `a[j]` if it was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing the integer `a[j]` only, `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the integer `a[j]` to the set `done`.
- If `a[j]` was already in `todo`, `done` now contains both the previous `a[j]` (if it was in `todo`) and the new `a[j]`.
- If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `done` now contains only the integer `a[j]`.
- The other variables (`r`, `m`, `old`, `a`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains 1.
