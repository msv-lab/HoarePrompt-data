Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, `j` is 0, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**

Explanation:
- `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[0]` to the set `extra`.
- The initial state specified that `extra` is an empty set, so after adding `a[0]`, `extra` now contains the single element `a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
