Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `a` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `old`, and `done`, `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]`. `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is `m + 1`.
- The set `done` is updated to include `a[r]`, which is `a[m + 1]`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
