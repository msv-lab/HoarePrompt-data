Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` also includes `old`, `done` has `old` removed from it, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`.***
