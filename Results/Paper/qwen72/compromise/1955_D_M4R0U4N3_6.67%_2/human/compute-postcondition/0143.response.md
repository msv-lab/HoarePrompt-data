To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `m` is `m`.
   - `n` is `n`.
   - `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`.
   - `todo` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `done` and were not in `todo` initially.
   - `done` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo` initially and any elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were added to `done` during the loop.
   - `extra` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `todo` initially and were not added to `done` during the loop.
   - `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of elements.
   - `m` and `n` are indices that define a sub-list of `a` from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`.
   - `done` and `todo` are lists that are populated based on the elements in the sub-list `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`.
   - `extra` is a list that contains elements from the sub-list that were not in `todo` initially and were not added to `done` during the loop.
   - `ans` is a counter that increments each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop processes elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`.
   - Elements are added to `todo` if they are not already in `done` or `todo`.
   - Elements are added to `done` if they are in `todo`.
   - Elements are added to `extra` if they are not in `todo` initially and not added to `done` during the loop.
   - The counter `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Since the exact values of `a`, `m`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times the length of done was greater than or equal to k during the loop)**
