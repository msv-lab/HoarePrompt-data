Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`, and the state of `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[1]` was in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]` but now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `a[1]` was in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`.**
