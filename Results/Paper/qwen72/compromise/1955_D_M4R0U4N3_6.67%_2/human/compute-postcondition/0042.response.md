Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` has been removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` has been removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it has been added to `extra`. Additionally, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. `ans` is increased by 1.**
