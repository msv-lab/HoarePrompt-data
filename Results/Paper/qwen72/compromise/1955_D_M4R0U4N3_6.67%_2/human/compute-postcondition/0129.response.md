The only variables in the loop head are `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.

At the start of the next iteration, `r` will be incremented by 1, so `r` will be `m + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`.

State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[1]`, and the state of `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
