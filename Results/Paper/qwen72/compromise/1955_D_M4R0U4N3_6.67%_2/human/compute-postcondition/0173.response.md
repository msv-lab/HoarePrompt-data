Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[m - m]` which is `a[0]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is `m-1`. Additionally, `old` is not in `extra`.**
