Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[r - m]`, and `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, and `done` now includes `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`, `done` has `old` removed from it, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `old` is not in `extra` and not in `done`, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
