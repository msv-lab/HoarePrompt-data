Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[0]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` is updated to include `old`, and `done` is updated to exclude `old`. `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`. `ans` is 2, indicating that the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is `m-1`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra` and remains not in `todo`. The length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`.**
