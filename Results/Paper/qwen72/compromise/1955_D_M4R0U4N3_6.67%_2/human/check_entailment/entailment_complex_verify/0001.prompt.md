You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`, `m` is less than `n`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `todo` contains elements from `a` that were not processed by the loop, `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, and `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in `b`. The function prints the count of such subarrays for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the internal sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It also initializes two sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that have been matched and elements that are not in `b`, respectively.

3. **First Subsegment**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` (the first subsegment).
   - If an element in this subsegment is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and initializes `ans` accordingly.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
  - It correctly updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides.
  - The condition `len(done) >= k` is used to determine if a subsegment is good, which aligns with the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `m` or when `k` is 1.
  - It also handles cases where elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, check membership) are efficient, typically O(1) on average.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
