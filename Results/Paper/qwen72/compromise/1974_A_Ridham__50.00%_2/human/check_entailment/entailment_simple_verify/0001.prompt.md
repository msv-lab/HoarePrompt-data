You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case, where each screen can accommodate up to 15 cells, and the total number of test cases is `n`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`), where `extra_space` is the space still needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of screens required is the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The program then correctly calculates the remaining cells available on these screens.
- The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no icons or only one type of icon.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons, considering both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
