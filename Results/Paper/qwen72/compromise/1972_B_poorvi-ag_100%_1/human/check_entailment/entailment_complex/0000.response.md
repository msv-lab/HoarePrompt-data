### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., no facing-up coins left) loses the game.
   - The goal is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win. This is because:
     - Alice starts first and can always make a move if there is an odd number of facing-up coins.
     - After Alice's move, the number of facing-up coins will become even.
     - Bob will then be forced to play with an even number of facing-up coins, and after his move, the number of facing-up coins will again become odd.
     - This pattern continues until there is only one facing-up coin left, which Alice can take, leaving Bob with no move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win. This is because:
     - Alice starts first and will be forced to play with an even number of facing-up coins.
     - After Alice's move, the number of facing-up coins will become odd.
     - Bob will then be able to make a move, and after his move, the number of facing-up coins will again become even.
     - This pattern continues until there are no facing-up coins left, and Alice will be the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the state of the coins.
   - It then checks if the number of facing-up coins (`arr.count('U')`) is odd.
     - If it is odd, it appends "yes" to the `results` list.
     - If it is even, it appends "no" to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each element of the `results` list.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The input and output handling is correct, and the program processes each test case as expected.
   - The final state of the `results` list is correctly printed, and the program does not modify the list after it has been populated.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
