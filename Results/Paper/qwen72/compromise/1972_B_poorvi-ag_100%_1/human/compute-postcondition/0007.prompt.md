You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, where each character is either "U" or "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` now contains a list of strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing the same list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no'. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console, but the contents of `results` are not modified.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads a series of test cases from stdin, where each test case includes the number of coins and their states. It returns the minimum number of flips required to make all coins face the same direction for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
