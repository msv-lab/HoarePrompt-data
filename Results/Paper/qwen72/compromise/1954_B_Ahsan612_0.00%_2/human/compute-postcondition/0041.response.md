Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and the input for the loop must be greater than 1. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.**

Explanation:
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input greater than 0.
- The values of `t`, `ar`, `same`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop (input for the loop must be greater than 1) is still valid.
- If `minn` is `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
