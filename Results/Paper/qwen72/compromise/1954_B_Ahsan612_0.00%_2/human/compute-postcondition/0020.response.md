The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. The initial state specifies that if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 2 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `i` is 4, and `minn` is 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 2 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `i` is 4, and `minn` is 1.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. **If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`):**
   - `same` is 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `num` will be updated to `ar[3]`

2. **If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`):**
   - `same` is 1
   - `num` is `ar[2]`
   - `i` is 4
   - `minn` is 1
   - `num` will be updated to `ar[4]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 3, `same` is 2 if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 4, `minn` is 1 if `ar[3]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, and `num` is `ar[3]` if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is `ar[4]`.**
