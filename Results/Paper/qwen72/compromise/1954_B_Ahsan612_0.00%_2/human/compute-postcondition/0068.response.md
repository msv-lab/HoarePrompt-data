Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), `same` is 3 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `i` is 6, and `num` is the element at index `i-2` of `ar`. `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`. `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`.**
