Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is now 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and is not equal to infinity.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it was already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
