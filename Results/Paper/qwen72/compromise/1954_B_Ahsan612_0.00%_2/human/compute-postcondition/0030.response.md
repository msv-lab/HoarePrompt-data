Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 5, `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and `same`, `i` is 6, `num` is `ar[6]`, `same` is 1.**

The value of `same` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. `minn` is still the minimum value between 1 and `same`, which is now 1. The integer `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `i` is 6, and `num` is the 7th element in the list `ar`.
