The variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, depending on the conditions stated. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `ar` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is either 2 or 3, for the loop to execute again, `ar` must have more than 2 elements. If `i` is 2, `ar` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again. If `i` is 3, `ar` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again. Since `ar` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2 or 3, the minimum length of `ar` that ensures the loop can execute again is 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the first element of `ar`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1, with `num` being the third element of `ar`.**
