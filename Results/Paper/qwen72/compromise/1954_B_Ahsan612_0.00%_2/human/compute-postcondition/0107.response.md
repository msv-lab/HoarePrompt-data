The value of `same` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `same` is unknown. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `len(ar)` must be greater than `i` (where `i` is 4 or 5), `same` is increased by 1.**
