The loop head in this case is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input. The variable `_` is a dummy variable that is not used within the loop. The only state that can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the user input.

Since the loop is controlled by the user input, and the user input is not a state that can be adjusted programmatically within the loop, the loop will execute the number of times specified by the user input, and this number does not change between iterations.

Therefore, the state remains the same for the next iteration, as the loop head does not modify any variables or states. The variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is now 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and is not equal to infinity.**
