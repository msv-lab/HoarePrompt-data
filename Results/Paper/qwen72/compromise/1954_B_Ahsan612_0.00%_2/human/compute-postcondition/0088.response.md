To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
while i < len(ar):
```

The loop condition depends on the variables `i` and `len(ar)`.

- `i` is 1.
- `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be true. This means that `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is the new input integer greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is 1.
- `num` is the first element of `ar` (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `same` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `minn` is `inf` (not relevant to the loop condition).

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`**.
