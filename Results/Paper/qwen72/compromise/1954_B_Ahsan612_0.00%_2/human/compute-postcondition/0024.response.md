Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 3, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 3 and `i` is 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` but `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `same` is 1, `i` is 4, and `num` is `ar[3]`. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and `ar[3]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, then `same` is 1, `i` is 5, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**
