Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, `minn` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- Since `same` is 1, `minn` will be set to 1 if it was greater than 1, or remain 1 if it was already 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and the condition `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`) remain unchanged.
