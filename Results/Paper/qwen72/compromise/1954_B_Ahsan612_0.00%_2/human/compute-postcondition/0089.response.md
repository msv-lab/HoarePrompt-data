Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
