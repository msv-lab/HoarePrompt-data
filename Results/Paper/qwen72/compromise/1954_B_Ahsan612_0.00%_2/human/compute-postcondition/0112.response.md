Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and `len(ar)` must be greater than `i` (where `i` is 4 or 5). If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is 8 or 9, `num` is the integer at index 8 or 9 in the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and 1, and `same` is 1.***
