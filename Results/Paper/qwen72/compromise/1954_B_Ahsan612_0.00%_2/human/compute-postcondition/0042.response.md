The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated string of integers from the user input and converts it into a list of integers, assigning it to `ar`. The length of `ar` is now the number of integers provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and the input for the loop must be greater than 1. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.**
