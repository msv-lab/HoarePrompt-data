Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 5, `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and `same`, `i` is 5 or 6, `num` is `ar[4]` or `ar[6]`, and `same` is 1 or increased by 1 if `ar[5]` was equal to `ar[4]`.***
