Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is 1.***
