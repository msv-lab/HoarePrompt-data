Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 3, `same` is 2 if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 4, `minn` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]` if `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is `ar[4]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- If `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 and `minn` is 1. The minimum of 1 and 2 is 1, so `minn` remains 1.
- If `ar[3]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1 and `minn` is 1. The minimum of 1 and 1 is 1, so `minn` remains 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) retain their initial values.
