You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `ar` is the last list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the array `ar` for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity) to keep track of the minimum segment length of consecutive identical elements.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element.
     - Updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1 to start counting the new segment of identical elements.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last segment of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements.
- It updates `minn` to the minimum length of these segments.
- If the array consists of all identical elements, `minn` will remain `inf`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- If the array has segments of different lengths, the program outputs the length of the smallest segment, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because removing any number of elements will not change the fact that all elements are the same.
- **Array with Multiple Segments:**
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest segment and outputs its length.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness:
**True**
