### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the annotations to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the initial assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- An array is called beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
- The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or output `-1` if it is impossible.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the number of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity, which will track the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and moves to the next element.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means all elements are identical, and the program prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - The function should take two parameters: an integer \( t \) and a list of lists.
  - However, the function does not take any parameters and reads input directly from `input()`.
  - This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the logic for the given problem.

- **Loop State:**
  - The loop iterates through the array and correctly counts the number of consecutive identical elements.
  - When a different element is found, it updates `minn` and resets `same`.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, `minn` is updated to account for the last segment of consecutive identical elements.
  - If `minn` is still infinity, it means all elements are identical, and the program prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

#### Key Issues:
- **Handling All Identical Elements:**
  - The program correctly identifies when all elements are identical by checking if `minn` is still infinity.
  - In this case, it prints `-1`, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

- **Minimum Number of Removals:**
  - The program calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
  - This is a valid approach because removing any element from a segment of consecutive identical elements will break the segment and potentially make the array non-beautiful.
  - However, the program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful (i.e., it cannot be made all identical by the given operations).

#### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 4 1 1 1 1`
  - The array is `1 1 1 1`, and all elements are identical.
  - The program will set `minn` to infinity and print `-1`, which is correct.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 5 1 2 1 2 1`
  - The array is `1 2 1 2 1`.
  - The program will find segments of `1 1`, `2 2`, and `1 1`, and `minn` will be 1.
  - The program will print `1`, which is correct because removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - The array is `1`, and it is already non-beautiful.
  - The program will set `minn` to 1 and print `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1` because the array is already non-beautiful and cannot be made beautiful by any operations.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the case where all elements are identical and prints `-1`.
- However, it fails to handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful and should output `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful and should output `-1`.
