Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the conditions provided and prints the sum along with `n + r`, where `r` is determined during the calculation. It then prints a series of lines, each containing a number (1 or 2), a second number (based on `j`), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the last processed `n`, the sum calculated for the last test case, and the value of `r` for the last test case. **
