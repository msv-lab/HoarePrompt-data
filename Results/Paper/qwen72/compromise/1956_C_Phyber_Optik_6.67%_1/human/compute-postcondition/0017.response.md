The code snippet provided is `r = i`. This assigns the value of `i` to `r`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, `r` will be 3 after this assignment. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `r` is 3. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 3. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by \( i \times n \). If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 + i \times n \) and `r` is 3. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( 2 \times (i \times n) \) and `r` is 3.**
