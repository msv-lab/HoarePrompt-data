The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `_` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `t`, `sum`, and `r` are also not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1**
