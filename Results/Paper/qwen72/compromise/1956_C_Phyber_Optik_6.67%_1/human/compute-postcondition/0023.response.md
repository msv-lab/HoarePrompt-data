To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:
```
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
```
The variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`**:
   - `j` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 on the first iteration. This is handled by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust `j`.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Variable `r`**:
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists. For the loop to execute, `n + r + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n + r` must be at least 1.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1.
- Since `n` is already greater than 0, `r` can be 0 or any non-negative integer.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged, not in the loop head).
- `_` is 0 (unchanged, not in the loop head).
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n` (unchanged, not in the loop head).
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n` (unchanged, not in the loop head).
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `n + r` must be at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `n + r` must be at least 1**
