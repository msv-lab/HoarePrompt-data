Postcondition: **`j` is incremented to 2, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**
