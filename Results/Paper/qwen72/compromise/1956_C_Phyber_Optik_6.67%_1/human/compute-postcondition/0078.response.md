To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the final adjusted state provided.

### Initial State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces. 

- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
