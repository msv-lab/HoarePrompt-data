Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `r` retain their initial values.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + r + 1` because the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration and stops when `j` exceeds `n + r`.
- **`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `r`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values. The loop only affects the value of `j` and the output printed to the console.

In summary, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `r`) will remain unchanged from their initial values.
