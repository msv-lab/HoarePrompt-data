Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Value of `j`:**
   - According to the initial state, `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `j` is not explicitly defined, it can be any integer from 1 to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1` followed by the value of `j`, and the output will end with a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer less than or equal to n)**
