Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `r` is 3, `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is incremented by \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \) is not checked in the provided code snippet, so the initial state of `sum` is simply updated by adding \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to it.
