Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `n + r` must be at least 1. Additionally, `j` is greater than `n`.***
