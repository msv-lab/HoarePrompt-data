Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated to be the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
