The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `j <= n + r`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, as this is what happens at the beginning of each iteration in a `for` loop. Therefore, `j` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, the condition `j <= n + r` must still be true, which means `n + r` must be at least 3.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `i`, `r`, and `sum`) are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**.
