The value of `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, and `t` is greater than 0. The value of `sum` was initially determined based on the conditions provided, and now it is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 3 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, otherwise `r` is 2 or 1 based on the initial conditions.**
