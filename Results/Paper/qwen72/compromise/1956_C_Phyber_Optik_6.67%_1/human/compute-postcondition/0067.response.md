Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. Additionally, `j` is less than or equal to `n`.**
