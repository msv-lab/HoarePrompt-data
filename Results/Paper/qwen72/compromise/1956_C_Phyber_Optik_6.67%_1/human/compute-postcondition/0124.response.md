Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is defined as `j + 1`. This implies that `j` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` holds true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds true.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the integer `1` followed by the value of `j`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determining the Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is defined as `j + 1`, it means that `j` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
   - The exact initial value of `j` is not provided, but we know that after the increment, `j` will be some integer value.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` must hold true, which means `j` can be any integer value such that `j <= n + r`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1` followed by the incremented value of `j`, and the output will end with a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **1 [j] (where [j] is the value of `j` after it has been incremented by 1, and `j` is an integer such that `j <= n + r`)**
