Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes, because the loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The variable `sum` will be the total sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`, depending on which condition is met.
- The variable `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If no such `i` exists, `r` will be 0.
