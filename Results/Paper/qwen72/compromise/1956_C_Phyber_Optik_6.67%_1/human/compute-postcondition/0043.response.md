Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`, where `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n + r + 1` because the loop runs until `j` is `n + r`, and the next value of `j` would be `n + r + 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `r`) remain unchanged because the loop does not modify them. The loop only prints values based on the current value of `j` and the input `n`.
