Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 0.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `i`, `r`, and `sum` remain unchanged based on the initial state, as they are not directly affected by the `n = int(input())` statement.
