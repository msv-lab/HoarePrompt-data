Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same input integer greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **`j`**: Remains `n + 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: This variable is updated to the largest integer `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. If this condition never holds true, `r` will remain 0.
- **`sum`**: The `sum` variable accumulates values based on the condition inside the loop. For each iteration `i`:
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `n * (n + 1) // 2` is added to `sum`.
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `i * n` is added to `sum`.
  - The final value of `sum` is the total sum of all these additions.
