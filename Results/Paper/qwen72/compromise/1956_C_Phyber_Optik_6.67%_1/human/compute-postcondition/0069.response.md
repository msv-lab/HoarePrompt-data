To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 1.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- Additionally, `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence, so each integer in the range will be printed separated by spaces.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
