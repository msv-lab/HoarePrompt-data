The function does not take any input parameters. The problem description implies that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases t is also an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The function should be able to read these inputs from standard input and output the results to standard output.
