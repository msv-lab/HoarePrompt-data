Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is the sum of the updated values of the first `bets` elements in `a`, where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` is 2.
- `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
- `i` is `bets - 1`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will always print `-1`, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned; it simply prints the constant value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
