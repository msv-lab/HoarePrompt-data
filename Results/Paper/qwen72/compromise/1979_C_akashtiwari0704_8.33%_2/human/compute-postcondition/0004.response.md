Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `prod` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
