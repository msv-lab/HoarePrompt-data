Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is now `int(a[0])`, `a[0]` is now `prod // a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[0]` to it.
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`) remain unchanged.
