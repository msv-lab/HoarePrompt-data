Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. This approach can lead to incorrect results because:

1. **Overflow Issues**: The product of all multipliers can easily exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, especially when `n` is large (up to 50) and each `k_i` can be up to 20. This can cause overflow issues, leading to incorrect calculations.

2. **Incorrect Bet Calculation**: The program assumes that dividing the product by each multiplier will result in a valid set of bets. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the case where all multipliers are the same (e.g., `k_1 = k_2 = ... = k_n`). In such a case, the sum of the bets will be equal to the product, which means the total bet will not be strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 3 3
```
- The program calculates `prod` as `3 * 3 * 3 = 27`.
- The bets are calculated as `a[0] = 27 // 3 = 9`, `a[1] = 27 // 3 = 9`, `a[2] = 27 // 3 = 9`.
- The total bet is `9 + 9 + 9 = 27`.
- The return for any winning outcome is `3 * 9 = 27`.

Since the total bet is equal to the return for any winning outcome, the program should output `-1`. However, it outputs `9 9 9`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
