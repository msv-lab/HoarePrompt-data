### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` and sorts `b`.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a max heap to store the differences between elements of `a` and the smallest and largest elements of `b`.
   - For each element `i` in `a`, it calculates the differences `diff1` and `diff2` with the smallest and largest elements of `b`, respectively.
   - It pushes the negative of the larger difference, the element `i`, and the index of the chosen element from `b` (either 0 or `m-1`) into the max heap.

3. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the max heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops elements from the heap and checks if the chosen element from `b` is still within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the chosen element is out of the current range, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in the range and updates the range accordingly.
   - If the chosen element is within the range, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the range by moving `tp1` or `tp2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same (as in the second test case) by correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m` (as in the third test case) by correctly choosing the elements to maximize the difference.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The sorting of `b` takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
   - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time each, and there are \(n\) such operations.
   - The overall complexity for each test case is \(O(m \log m + n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
