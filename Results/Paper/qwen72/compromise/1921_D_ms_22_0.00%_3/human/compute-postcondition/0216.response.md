Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value.** 

The `max_heap` list now contains one less tuple than before, specifically `n-2` tuples. The value of `t` remains `t - n - 1` and is still greater than 0. The values of `n` and `m` are unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers provided by the user, and `b` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user. The `item` tuple has been removed from `max_heap` and now holds the tuple with the smallest negative `diff` value.
