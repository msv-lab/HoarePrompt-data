Postcondition: ***`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
