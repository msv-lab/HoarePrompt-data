Output State: **`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `tp2` is decreased by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
