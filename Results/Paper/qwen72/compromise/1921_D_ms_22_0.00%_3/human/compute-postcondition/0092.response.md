Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The initial state is mostly unchanged except that the variable `ans` is now explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values and conditions.
