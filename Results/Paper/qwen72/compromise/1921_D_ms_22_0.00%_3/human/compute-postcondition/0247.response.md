The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`. The function must handle these inputs as follows:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, where `n` is the length of the list `a_i` and `m` is the length of the list `b_i`.
  - `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
  - The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input lists `a_i` and `b_i`. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the function's expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers `n` and `m`. It returns a result for each test case based on the input lists.**
