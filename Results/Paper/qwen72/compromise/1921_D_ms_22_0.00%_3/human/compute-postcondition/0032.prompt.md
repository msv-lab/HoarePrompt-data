Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` and `m` are the values provided by the user input. `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module. `a` is a list of integers input by the user. `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, where the integers are the result of splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. `max_heap` is an empty list. `tp1` is 0. `tp2` is `m - 1`. `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`, and `diff1` is still greater than `diff2`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `diff2` is now updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, and `diff1` is still greater than `diff2`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. In both cases, `diff1` and `diff2` retain their relationships as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
