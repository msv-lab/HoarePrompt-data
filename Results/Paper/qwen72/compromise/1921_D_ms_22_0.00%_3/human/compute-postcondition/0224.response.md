Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += -item[0]` adds the absolute value of the first element of the tuple `item` to the variable `ans`.
- Since `item` is a tuple with the smallest negative `diff` value, `-item[0]` is the positive value of `diff`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
