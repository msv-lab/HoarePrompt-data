Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]` based on future conditions, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is an index in the list `b`, `tp2` is an index in the list `b` and is now `tp2 - 1`.**
