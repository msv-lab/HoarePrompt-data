Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `diff2` is now updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, and `diff1` is still greater than `diff2`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
