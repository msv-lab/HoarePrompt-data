Postcondition: ***`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
