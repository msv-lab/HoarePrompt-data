Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It only contains functions that handle input in different ways, but there is no logic implemented to solve the actual problem of rearranging the permutation to ensure that binary search will find the element `x` correctly. The program needs to include the logic for identifying the necessary swaps and performing the binary search to validate the solution.
