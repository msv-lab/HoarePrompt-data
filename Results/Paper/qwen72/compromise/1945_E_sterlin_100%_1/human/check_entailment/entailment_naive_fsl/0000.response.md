Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The program consists of several functions that read input, but it does not perform the binary search or the required swaps to rearrange the permutation. The problem description requires the program to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but the provided program does not perform any of these operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
