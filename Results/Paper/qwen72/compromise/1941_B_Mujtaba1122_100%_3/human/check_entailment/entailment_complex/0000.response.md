### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(list, n):**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise it returns `True`.
     - This function is correct and straightforward.

   - **func_2(list, n):**
     - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
     - It iterates over the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
     - For each index \( i \), it repeatedly applies the operation as long as \( list[i] > 1 \), \( list[i-1] > 0 \), and \( list[i+1] > 0 \).
     - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) becomes zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if the entire list is zero.
     - If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flaw in func_2:**
   - The operation in `func_2` is applied in a way that ensures \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are decremented by the same amount as \( list[i] \) is decremented by twice that amount.
   - However, the condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied in all necessary cases.
   - Specifically, the operation should be applied as long as \( list[i] \ge 2 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than zero.
   - The current implementation may prematurely exit the loop if \( list[i] \) is exactly 1, even if \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are still positive, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array might not be reducible to zero.
   - For example, if the array is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, the function should return 'YES' immediately.
   - If the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function should return 'NO' because it's impossible to reduce all elements to zero using the given operation.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where \( list[i] \) is exactly 1.
   - Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the edge case where the array might already be zero or where it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_2` function does not correctly apply the operation in all necessary cases and does not handle edge cases properly.
