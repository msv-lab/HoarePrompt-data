Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not ensure that all elements of the array can be reduced to zero in a way that is consistent with the problem's operation rules.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to reduce all elements to zero using the described operations. However, the program does not correctly handle this case.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program attempts to reduce the elements by using the values of `list[i-1]` as the decrement factor, which is not consistent with the problem's operation rules. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the program incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i-1]`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array elements are not in a form that allows the operation to be applied successfully. For example, if the array has elements that are not divisible by the required decrements, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to reduce all elements to zero.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program can potentially enter an infinite loop if the conditions inside the `while` loop are not properly managed. For example, if `list[i]` is not sufficiently large to allow the operation to be applied, the loop may never terminate.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the sum of the elements at even indices and the sum of the elements at odd indices are equal. This is because each operation affects one even-indexed element and two odd-indexed elements (or vice versa), and the total reduction must be balanced between even and odd indices.

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    even_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(0, n, 2))
    odd_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(1, n, 2))
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

This approach correctly checks if the sum of elements at even indices is equal to the sum of elements at odd indices, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be reducible to zero using the given operations.
