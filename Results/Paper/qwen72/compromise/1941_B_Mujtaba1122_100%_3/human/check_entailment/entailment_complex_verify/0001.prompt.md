You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: `list` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list), and `i` is `n-1`. If any element in the first `n` elements of `list` is not 0, the function returns False. Otherwise, all the first `n` elements of `list` are 0.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all the first `n` elements in the list `list` are 0, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list), and `i` is `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `list` and a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(list)). It returns `False` if any of the first `n` elements in the list are not 0. If all the first `n` elements are 0, it returns `True`.

            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]

If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function returns `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` within the range 3 to 200,000. It modifies the list such that, after execution, the first two elements (`list[0]` and `list[1]`) are 0, and all elements from index 2 to `n-2` are also 0. The last element (`list[n-1]`) is reduced by the sum of the original values from index 2 to `n-2`. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. If `func_1` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that modifies three consecutive elements.
   - The operation is defined as: for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)), the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are decreased by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0 and \( a_i \) is greater than 1.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, scaled by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - If at any point \( a_{i-1} \) becomes non-zero, it prints "no" and returns.
   - After attempting to apply the operations, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Analysis of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm attempts to reduce the elements of the array by applying the operation in a greedy manner.
   - However, the scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) in the operation is incorrect. The operation should only decrement by 1, 2, and 1, not by \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is also too restrictive. The operation can be applied as long as \( a_i \) is at least 2 and the neighboring elements are positive.
   - The function does not handle cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided program has logical errors in the way it applies the operation and checks the conditions.
   - The scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) in the operation is incorrect and can lead to invalid results.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive and may prevent valid operations from being applied.
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the way the operation is applied and the conditions checked. A correct solution would need to apply the operation correctly and handle all edge cases.
