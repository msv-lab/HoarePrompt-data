To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```

The conditions in the loop head are:
1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
- `i` is 3
- `list[0]` is 0
- `list[1]` is 0
- `list[2]` is 0
- `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`
- `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `list[i] > 1` translates to `list[3] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0` translates to `list[2] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0` translates to `list[4] > 0`

From the given state:
- `list[2]` is 0, so `list[i - 1] > 0` is false.
- `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, which simplifies to `list[3]` (since `list[2]` is 0).
- `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`, which simplifies to `list[4]` (since `list[2]` is 0).

Since `list[2]` is 0, the condition `list[i - 1] > 0` is not satisfied, and the loop will not execute again. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `list[2]` must be greater than 0.

However, we cannot directly adjust `list[2]` because it is not in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`. Since `i` is 3, the next iteration would require `i` to be 4. We need to ensure that the conditions are met for `i = 4`:

- `list[4] > 1`
- `list[3] > 0`
- `list[5] > 0`

Given that `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]` and `list[2]` is 0, `list[4]` remains as it was before the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `list[4]` is greater than 1 and `list[5]` is greater than 0.

Since we cannot adjust `list[2]` directly, we need to ensure that the conditions are met for `i = 4` by adjusting the state of `i` and the conditions on `list[4]` and `list[5]`.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` must be greater than 0**
