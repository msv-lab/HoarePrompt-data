Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `list[0]` is 0.
   - `list[1]` is 0.
   - `list[2]` is 0.
   - `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]`.
   - The current value of `list[i - 1]` is not 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `list[0]` is 0.
   - `list[1]` is 0.
   - `list[2]` is 0.
   - `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
   - The current value of `list[1]` is not 0, which contradicts the initial state where `list[1]` is 0. This contradiction suggests that there might be a mistake in the precondition, but we will proceed with the given information.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement: `print('no')`.

4. **Execution:**
   - The `print` statement will simply print the string `'no'`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the contradiction in the precondition, the `print` statement is straightforward and will print the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
