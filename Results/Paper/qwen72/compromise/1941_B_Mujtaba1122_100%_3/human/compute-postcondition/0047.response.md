Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 4 * list[3]` and must be greater than 1, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3] - 1 * list[3]` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[4]` by subtracting `2 * list[3]` from it.
- Initially, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]` and must be greater than 1.
- After the code execution, `list[4]` becomes `list[4] - 2 * list[3] - 2 * list[3]`, which simplifies to `list[4] - 4 * list[3]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
