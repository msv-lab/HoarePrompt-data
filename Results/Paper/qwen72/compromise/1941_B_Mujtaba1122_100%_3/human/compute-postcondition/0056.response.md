Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `list[0]` is 0.
   - `list[1]` is 0.
   - For all `j` in the range `2` to `n-2`, `list[j]` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - The value of `list[n-1]` is the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of all the values that were originally in `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` multiplied by 1.
   - `list[n-2]` is 0.
   - The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` for the current state of the list and `n`.

2. **Understanding the List:**
   - The list starts with two zeros: `list[0] = 0` and `list[1] = 0`.
   - All elements from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` are also zeros.
   - The last element `list[n-1]` is modified by subtracting the sum of all elements from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` (which are all zeros) from its original value.
   - Since the sum of all elements from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` is 0, `list[n-1]` remains unchanged from its original value.

3. **Function `func_1(list, n)`:**
   - The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` for the current state of the list and `n`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
