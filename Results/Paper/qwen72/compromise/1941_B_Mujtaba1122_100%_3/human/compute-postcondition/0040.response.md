Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3] - list[3]` (which is still greater than 0), `list[5]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- Since `i` is 4, `list[3]` is modified.
- `list[3]` is decremented by its own value, effectively setting `list[3]` to 0.
- The value of `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3] - list[3]`, which simplifies to `list[4] - 3 * list[3]`.
- Given that `list[4]` was initially greater than 1 and `list[3]` was greater than 0, `list[4]` is still greater than 0 after the operation.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
