Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[3]` by subtracting `2 * list[2]` from it.
- Since `i` is 3, `list[3]` is updated to `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`.
- The values of `list[0]`, `list[1]`, `list[2]`, and `list[4]` remain unchanged.
- The length of the list `n` and the value of `i` also remain unchanged.
