The code snippet `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting the value of the element at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state:

- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
- `i` is 3
- `list[0]` is 0
- `list[1]` is 0
- `list[2]` must be greater than 0
- `list[3]` must be greater than 1
- `list[4]` must be greater than 0

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `i + 1` is 4.
2. `i - 1` is 2.
3. `list[4]` is modified by subtracting the value of `list[2]`.

Since `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` will be reduced by a positive value. The new value of `list[4]` will be `list[4] - list[2]`.

The other values in the list and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[3]` is greater than 1, `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`**.
