Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is no value or variable being returned. The `return` statement is used without specifying any value or variable, which means the function will return `None` by default. However, since the instruction is to describe what the program returns in natural language and not to mention `None` explicitly, the output state is that the program returns nothing.
