Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 2, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`, `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
- `list[1]` is updated to `list[1] - 1 * list[1]`, which simplifies to `0`.
- The values of `list[0]`, `list[2]`, and `list[3]` remain unchanged.
- The length of the list `n` and the value of `i` remain the same.
- The initial conditions for `list[2]` and `list[3]` are still valid.
