Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[3]` and must be 0, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 4 * list[3]` and must be greater than 1, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3] - 1 * list[3]` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[3]` by subtracting `list[3]` from itself, which results in `list[3]` being set to 0. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
