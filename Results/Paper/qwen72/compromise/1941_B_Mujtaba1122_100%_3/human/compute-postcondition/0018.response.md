The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `list`, along with the length `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range `1` to `n - 2` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

The state of the list `list` and the length `n` do not need to be adjusted in the loop head, but we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute again.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]`, and `list[i - 1]` is 0**
