The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list` and `n`. `list` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function does not return any value in any of the cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` within the range 3 to 200,000, and does not return any value.**
