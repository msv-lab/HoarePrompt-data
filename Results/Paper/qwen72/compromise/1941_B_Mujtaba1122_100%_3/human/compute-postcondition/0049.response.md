Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is 0, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3] - 2 * list[3]` and must be greater than 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The list `list` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where `4 < n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- The index `i` is still 4.
- The first three elements of the list (`list[0]`, `list[1]`, and `list[2]`) remain 0.
- The element at index 3 (`list[3]`) is 0, as it is decremented to 0 in the first iteration.
- The element at index 4 (`list[4]`) is 0, as it is decremented by `2 * list[3]` in each iteration until it is no longer greater than 1.
- The element at index 5 (`list[5]`) is `list[5] - 3 * list[3]` and must still be greater than 0, as it is decremented by `list[3]` in each of the three iterations.

The loop stops when `list[4]` is no longer greater than 1, or when `list[5]` is no longer greater than 0. In this case, after the third iteration, `list[4]` becomes 0, and the loop condition is no longer satisfied. Therefore, the loop terminates, and the final state is as described above.
