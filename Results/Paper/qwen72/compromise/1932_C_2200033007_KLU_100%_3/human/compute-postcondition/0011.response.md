Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of `n` integers, where each integer is the product of the corresponding element in `b` and all subsequent elements in `b`, modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by selecting elements from `a` in an order specified by the characters in `s` ('L' for left-to-right and 'R' for right-to-left). **
