You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return any value but prints a string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on their balance values and positions. Specifically, the characters are sorted such that those with the same balance value are ordered by their position in descending order, and then the characters are concatenated into a single string.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix and then sorting the characters based on the balance and position.

2. **Function 1:**
   - This function is a comparison function that is used to sort the `balance_info` list.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance. If the balances are different, it sorts by balance in ascending order.
   - If the balances are the same, it sorts by position in descending order.
   - The function is correctly implemented to achieve the required sorting behavior.

3. **Function 2:**
   - This function takes a string `s` as input and performs the balanced shuffle operation.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character.
   - It iterates through the string, computing the balance of each prefix and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to the list.
   - The balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis '(' and decremented for a closing parenthesis ')'.
   - After computing the balance for all characters, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the comparison function defined in `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **BalanceInfo Class:**
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.
   - The class should be defined as:
     ```python
     class BalanceInfo:
         def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
             self.balance = balance
             self.position = position
             self.character = character
     ```

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly computes the balance of each prefix.
   - The sorting logic is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
   - The construction of the result string is correct.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
