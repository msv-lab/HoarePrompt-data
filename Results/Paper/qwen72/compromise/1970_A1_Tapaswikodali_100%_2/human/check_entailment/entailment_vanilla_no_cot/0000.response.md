Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is not directly used in the program, but it seems to be a comparison function that could be used for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance, and if the balances are the same, it sorts them by position in descending order.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs the balanced shuffle operation.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input string `s`.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of the parentheses.
   - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` with the current balance, position, and character.
   - After collecting all the balance information, it sorts the `balance_info` list using a lambda function that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description:
- It computes the balance for each prefix.
- It sorts the characters based on the balance and position.
- It constructs and prints the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.
