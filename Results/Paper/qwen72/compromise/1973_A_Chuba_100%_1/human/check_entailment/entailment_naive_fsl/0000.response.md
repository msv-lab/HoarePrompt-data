Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula `result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of draws.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. If `v[2]` (the highest score) is more than the sum of the other two scores, it means there are more points than can be explained by the number of games played, and the program adjusts the total score accordingly.
   - The division by 2 is necessary because each draw results in 2 points being distributed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If all scores are 0, the program correctly prints `0` (no draws).
   - **One Game Drawn**: If the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` (one draw).
   - **Inconsistent Scores**: If the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **All Draws**: If the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - **Mixed Wins and Draws**: If the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` (the maximum number of draws).

The program handles all the given examples and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
