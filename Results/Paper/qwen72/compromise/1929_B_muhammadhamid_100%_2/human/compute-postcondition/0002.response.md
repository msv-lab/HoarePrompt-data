The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8. `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these two parameters and return a result based on the constraints and relationships between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
