The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`, `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 2`, `i` is 2**
