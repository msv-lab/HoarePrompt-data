Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and additional elements that were appended during the loop execution, such that the total length of `ans` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and an additional element that is `ans[-1] - 1`, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and an additional element that is `ans[-1] - 1`, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and two additional elements, the last element is `ans[-2] - 1` and the second last element is `ans[-3] - 1`, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
