Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is the sum of the previous value of `cur` and `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` or the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i]` or the values `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv` and `a[i]`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is the sum of the previous value of `cur` and `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` or the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i]` or the values `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv` and `a[i]`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`. If `i` > 0, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended which are equal to `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, and `cur` is reduced by `adv`. If `i` is 0, `adv` is not modified, `j` is not modified, and `ans` remains unchanged. The value `a[i]` has been appended to the list `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same. If `i` > 0, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` now includes the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all 0 ≤ j < `adv` at the end of the list, and `a[i]` is appended to the end of `ans`. `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv + counter[a[i]]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is `counter[a[i]] - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
