Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only attempts to split the first out-of-order element that is greater than 10, but it does not recursively check if further splits are needed to ensure the array is sorted. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

**Example of incorrect behavior:**

Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the first test case:
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not check if further splits are needed.
- The array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is already sorted, so the program will print `Yes`.

For the second test case:
- The array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not check if further splits are needed.
- The array `[1, 2, 28, 5]` is not sorted, so the program will print `No`.

For the third test case:
- The array is `[0, 0]`.
- The array is already sorted, so the program will print `Yes`.

However, the program fails to handle cases where multiple elements need to be split. For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
- The array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is not fully sorted, so the program will print `No`, which is incorrect because the array can be sorted by splitting `45` as well.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
