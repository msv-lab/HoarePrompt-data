You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 99, inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to the sorted list `sorted_lst`. This will be `True` if `lst` was already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only attempts to split the first out-of-order element that is greater than 10, but it does not recursively check if further splits are needed to ensure the array is sorted. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

**Example of incorrect behavior:**

Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the first test case:
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not check if further splits are needed.
- The array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is already sorted, so the program will print `Yes`.

For the second test case:
- The array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not check if further splits are needed.
- The array `[1, 2, 28, 5]` is not sorted, so the program will print `No`.

For the third test case:
- The array is `[0, 0]`.
- The array is already sorted, so the program will print `Yes`.

However, the program fails to handle cases where multiple elements need to be split. For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
- The array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is not fully sorted, so the program will print `No`, which is incorrect because the array can be sorted by splitting `45` as well.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
