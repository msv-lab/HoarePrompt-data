Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining if a given array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its digits. However, there are a few issues with the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Operation Application**: The program attempts to apply the operation to the array elements, but it only does so once for the first pair of elements that violate the non-decreasing order. This is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it should also consider splitting `45` and `67` if necessary.

2. **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. However, the program should ensure that the operation is applied in a way that guarantees the array can be sorted, not just check if it is sorted after a single operation.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where the operation might need to be applied to multiple elements in a single test case.

4. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program does not have a mechanism to prevent infinite loops in cases where the operation might need to be applied multiple times. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` but will not check if further splits are needed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Apply the operation to all elements that are at least 10.
- Check if the resulting array is sorted after all possible operations are applied.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
