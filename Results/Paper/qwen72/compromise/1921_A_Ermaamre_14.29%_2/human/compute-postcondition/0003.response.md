Functionality: **The function reads from standard input (stdin) an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing four lines with two integers x_i, y_i per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then processes each test case and prints to standard output (stdout) the area of the square for each test case.**
