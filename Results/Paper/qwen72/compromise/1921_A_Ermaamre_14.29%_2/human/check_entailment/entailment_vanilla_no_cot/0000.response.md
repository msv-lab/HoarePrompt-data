Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible configurations of the square's corners. The program assumes a specific order of the points, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. The problem states that the corners are given in a random order, and the program needs to be able to handle any permutation of the corners.

### Issues:
1. **Point Comparison Logic**: The program checks if certain pairs of x-coordinates are equal and then calculates the side length based on the y-coordinates. However, this logic is flawed because it assumes a specific arrangement of the points, which may not always be the case.

2. **Handling Random Order**: The program does not account for the fact that the points can be in any order. For example, if the points are given as:
   - (1, 2)
   - (4, 2)
   - (1, 5)
   - (4, 5)
   The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Collect all four points.
2. Identify the two unique x-coordinates and the two unique y-coordinates.
3. Calculate the side length of the square as the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes).
4. Compute the area as the square of the side length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in points))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in points))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle any permutation of the square's corners and compute the area accurately.
