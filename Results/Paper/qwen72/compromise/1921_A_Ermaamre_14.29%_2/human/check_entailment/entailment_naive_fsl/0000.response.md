Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes a specific order of the input coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The problem states that the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, but the program only checks a limited set of conditions for the coordinates, which may not cover all possible permutations of the corners.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square in this case because it does not handle the scenario where the coordinates are given in this particular order. The program should be able to handle any permutation of the corner coordinates and still correctly compute the area of the square.
