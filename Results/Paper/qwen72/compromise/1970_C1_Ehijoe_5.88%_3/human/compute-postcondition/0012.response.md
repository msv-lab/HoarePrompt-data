Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
2. `tree` is a deque containing integers.
3. `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True.
4. `start` is an input integer.
5. `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`.
6. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
7. All elements in `moves` are even.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Hermione')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Hermione'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `'Hermione'` regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, `start`, `idx`, or `moves`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Hermione**
