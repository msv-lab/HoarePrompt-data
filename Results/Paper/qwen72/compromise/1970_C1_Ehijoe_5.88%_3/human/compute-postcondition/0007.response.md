Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`.** 

The code assigns the index of the integer `start` within the deque `tree` to the variable `idx`. The values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, and `empty` remain unchanged. The variable `start` is still the input integer it was initially.
