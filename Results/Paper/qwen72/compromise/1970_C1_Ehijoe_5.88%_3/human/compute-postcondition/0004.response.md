Output State: `n` and `t` are integers provided by the user, `tree` is a deque containing the integers that form a specific sequence based on the input pairs, `empty` is False. 

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, where `n` is provided by the user.
- `tree` starts as an empty deque and `empty` is initially True.
- On the first iteration, `u` and `v` are appended to `tree`, and `empty` is set to False.
- For subsequent iterations, the loop checks if `u` or `v` match the first or last elements of `tree` and appends or appendsleft accordingly.
- After all iterations, `tree` contains a sequence of integers, and `empty` is False.
