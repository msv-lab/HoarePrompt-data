Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the function should be called with input data that includes the number of nodes `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), the number of rounds `t` (where t=1), and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a list of starting nodes for each round, which in this case is a single integer since t=1.**
