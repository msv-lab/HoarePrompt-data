Output State: `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node from the input and the value is a list of nodes that are connected to it, and `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one connection (i.e., nodes with a list of length 1 in the `nodes` dictionary).
