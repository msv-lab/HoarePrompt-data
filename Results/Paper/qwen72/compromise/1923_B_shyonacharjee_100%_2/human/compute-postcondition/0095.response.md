The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: (n, k, a, x). Here, `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints and relationships between these elements. Specifically, for each test case:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. However, the specific return value for each test case is not provided in the output description.
