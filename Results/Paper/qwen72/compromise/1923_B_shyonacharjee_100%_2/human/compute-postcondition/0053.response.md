Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple and must have at least 2 tuples, `pos` is the first element of the next tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the next tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.**
