Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop either completed or broke, `can_survive` is False if at any point the total bullets needed exceeded the product of the distance and `k` for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` is True.**

The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
