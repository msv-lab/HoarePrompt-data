Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is False if at any point the total bullets needed exceeded the product of the distance and `k` for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` is True.**

The value of `bullets_used` is reset to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
