The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop to indicate that its value is not used within the loop body. Therefore, no specific state for `_` needs to be adjusted, but `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
