The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of an integer `slength` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `slength`. For each set, it checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `tests`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the state of the last iteration, and the number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs will match the number of test cases `t`.
