Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20.
- `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `tests` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`.
- `no` is True.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'NO'. The value of `no` being True does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not using the variable `no` in any way. The string 'NO' is a constant and will be printed as is.

Output: **NO**
