Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20
- `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `tests` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `slength` is an input integer
- `no` is False

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Explanation:
- The `print` statement is a simple string literal that prints the string 'NO'.
- The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

Output: **NO**
