Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is `tests - 1`, `slength` is an input integer. For each iteration, if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`, `no` is True and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `no` is False and 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `tests` iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will still be as initially described, with `a`, `b`, and `c` being input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The variable `tests` will be the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` will be `tests - 1` (indicating the last iteration index), and `slength` will be the last input integer read for the length of the strings. For each iteration, if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`, the program will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'.
