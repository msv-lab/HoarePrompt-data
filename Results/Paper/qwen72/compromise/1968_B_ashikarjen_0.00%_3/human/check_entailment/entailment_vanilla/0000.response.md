Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads the input values for `n` and `m` from a single line using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the next two lines. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `k` and `j` are initialized to 0. `k` will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to track the current position in `b`.

3. **Loop Through `a`**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each character in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Find Matching Character in `b`**: Inside the loop, there is a `while` loop that increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches the current character in `a` or until `j` exceeds the length of `b`. This ensures that the function is looking for the next occurrence of the current character in `a` within `b`.

5. **Update `k` and `j`**: If a matching character is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented to indicate that the current character of `a` is part of the subsequence, and `j` is incremented to move to the next character in `b`. If no matching character is found, the `while` loop breaks, and the `for` loop also breaks, stopping the search.

6. **Output**: After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The logic of the function is correct and follows the problem description. It correctly identifies the maximum `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

Correctness: **True**
