The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of test cases and the test cases themselves. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The integers `n` and `m` satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the total sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The binary strings `a` and `b` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, handling multiple test cases with the constraint that the total sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
