The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, and `a[0]`, `a[1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`, `j` is increased by 1.**
