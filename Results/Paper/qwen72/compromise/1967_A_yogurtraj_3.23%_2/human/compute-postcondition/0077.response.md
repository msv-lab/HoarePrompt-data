The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, so `r` is assigned the value of `a[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`.**
