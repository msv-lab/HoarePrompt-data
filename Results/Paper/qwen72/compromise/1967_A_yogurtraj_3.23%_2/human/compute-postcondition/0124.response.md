Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ii` remains 2, `n` is the same as the input integer, `a` is the same sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions and is not equal to 0, `r` is the last updated value based on the loop conditions, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation, and `y` is the number of elements left unprocessed after the loop breaks or completes.**
