Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the initial number of cards of each type. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer within the specified range, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, while `k` remains non-zero. If `k` is 0, `r` is the final value of `a[i]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` depending on the condition, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `k` is not equal to 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking. If `k` is 0, `r` is the final value of `a[n-1]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` depending on the condition, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ii` remains 2, `n` is the same as the input integer, `a` is the same sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions. If `k` is not 0, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation, and `y` is the number of elements left unprocessed after the loop breaks or completes. If `k` is 0, `r` remains the last updated value based on the loop conditions, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation, and `y` is the number of elements left unprocessed after the loop breaks or completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
