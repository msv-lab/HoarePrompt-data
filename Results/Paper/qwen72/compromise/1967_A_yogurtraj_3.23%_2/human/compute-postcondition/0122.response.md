Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, and `rem` is either `k % 3` or 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is the fourth element of `a`, and `y` is 0.***
