Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is an integer within a specified range.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `k` is not 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`:**
   - First, compute `r - 1`.
   - Then, multiply the result by `n`.
   - Finally, add 1 to the product.

### Explanation:
- `r` is the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` simplifies to:
  - `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is a non-zero integer, and n is an integer within the specified range)**
