Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `r` is the first element of `a`.** 

The value of `r` is now the first element of the list `a`, which is a sorted list of integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
