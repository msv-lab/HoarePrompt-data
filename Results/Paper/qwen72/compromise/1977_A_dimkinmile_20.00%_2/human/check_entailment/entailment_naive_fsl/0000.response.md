Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes) and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that Nikita can both add and remove cubes in his moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, Nikita cannot achieve a tower with 4 cubes after only 2 moves, because he can only add or remove 1 cube per move. The correct answer should be "No", but the program will incorrectly output "Yes" because `n` (2) is less than `m` (4).

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 1`. The program will output "Yes" because `n` (3) is greater than or equal to `m` (1), but the correct answer should be "No" because after 3 moves, Nikita cannot have exactly 1 cube in the tower. He can have 0, 2, or 3 cubes, but not 1.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can either add or remove 1 cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves is that the tower can have an even number of cubes added or removed. The correct logic would be:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This logic ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.
