### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, which is correct as it matches the requirement to handle multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()` for each test case. The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input. This is correct as the problem specifies that each test case contains two integers.

4. **Condition Check**: The original program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` using the condition `if n >= m:`. This is incorrect because the problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, not just if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

5. **Parity Consideration**: The original assessment correctly points out that the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must be considered. Specifically, Nikita can only end up with an odd number of cubes if `n` is odd, and an even number of cubes if `n` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0 cubes, the parity of the number of cubes will match the parity of the number of moves.

6. **Correct Condition**: To correctly determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the program should check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd) and if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:

- **State Before Function Call**: The function `func_1` is expected to handle the input for each test case. The state of the program before the function call is correct, as it is prepared to handle multiple test cases.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Input Reading**: The function reads `n` and `m` from the input, which is correct.
  - **Condition Check**: The condition `if n >= m:` is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`.
  - **Output**: The output based on the incorrect condition is also incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program, as suggested in the original assessment, is:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n % 2 == m % 2):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`. The corrected program, which checks both the condition `n >= m` and the parity `n % 2 == m % 2`, is the correct solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
