Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to determine a value `t`, and prints `t`. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters. **
