### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The function calculates the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then determines the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons by dividing the total number of cells by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and rounding up. This is done using the formula:
     - `t = b * 2` (since each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows of 5 cells each).
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1` (rounding up).
   - This part of the logic is correct. Each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows, and since each screen has 5 rows, the number of screens needed is `b * 2 // 5` if the division is exact, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` if there is a remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The function calculates the total number of cells available on the screens already used for 2x2 icons as `t * 15`.
   - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`b * 4`) to get the number of remaining cells: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This part of the logic is also correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (remaining 1x1 icons that need space).
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` (rounding up).
   - This part of the logic is correct. It correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem description.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Calculation:
    - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
    - `t % 5 != 0` so `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1`
    - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
    - `11 >= 1` so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `7 2`
  - Calculation:
    - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
    - `t % 5 != 0` so `t = 4 // 5 + 1 = 1`
    - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
    - `7 >= 7` so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `12 4`
  - Calculation:
    - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`
    - `t % 5 != 0` so `t = 8 // 5 + 1 = 2`
    - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14`
    - `14 < 12` so additional screens are needed.
    - `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (This is incorrect, should be `12 - 14 = -2` but should be handled as `0` since `t1` is already 14 and can fit all 12 1x1 icons).
    - Correct calculation should be: `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14`, `14 >= 12` so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `0 3`
  - Calculation:
    - `t = 3 * 2 = 6`
    - `t % 5 != 0` so `t = 6 // 5 + 1 = 2`
    - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
    - `18 >= 0` so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 0`

    - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
    - `0 < 1` so additional screens are needed.
    - `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
    - `1 % 15 != 0` so `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
