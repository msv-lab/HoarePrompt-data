To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000).
   - `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50).
   - `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5).
   - `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
   - `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user.
   - `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
   - `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the last key in `hmp` processed by the loop.
   - `ans` is the final sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character in `s` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

2. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each character in 'ABCDEF':
     - If the character is not present in `s`, add `m` to `ans`.
     - If the character is present in `s` and its frequency in `hmp` is less than `m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = "ABCD"`, `m = 3`, and `hmp` is `{'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`.
   - Characters in 'ABCDEF' that are not in `s`: 'E', 'F'.
     - Contribution to `ans`: `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - Characters in `s` with frequency less than `m`:
     - 'A': `3 - 1 = 2`
     - 'B': `3 - 2 = 1`
     - 'C': `3 - 1 = 2`
     - 'D': `3 - 1 = 2`
   - Total contribution to `ans`: `2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7`.
   - Final `ans`: `6 + 7 = 13`.

4. **General Description:**
   - `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character in `s` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in s plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character in s where hmp[i] is less than m)**
