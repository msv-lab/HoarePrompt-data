Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`. For each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these increments.**
