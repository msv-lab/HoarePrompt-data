Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct as the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.
4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.
5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.
6. **Output for Each Case**: The program prints "STAIRS" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if they form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise. However, the output for a stair should be "STAIR" (without the 'S' at the end) as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output for the stair condition. The correct output should be "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS".

Correctness: **False**
