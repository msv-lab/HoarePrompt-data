Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `present` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`.**

The code snippet assigns the value `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` is `x - 2`.
