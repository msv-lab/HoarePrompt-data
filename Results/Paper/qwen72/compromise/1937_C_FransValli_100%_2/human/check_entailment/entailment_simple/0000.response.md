### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The function `func()` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `maxi` of the element that, when ORed with itself, is the largest among all elements.
   - This is done by comparing `p_maxi | p_maxi` with `p_i | p_i` for each `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`.
   - If `p_i | p_i` is greater, `maxi` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding Elements with the Same OR Value**:
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to find all indices `i` such that `p_maxi | p_i` is equal to `p_maxi | p_arr[0]`.
   - This is done by comparing `p_maxi | p_arr[0]` with `p_maxi | p_i`.
   - If `p_maxi | p_i` is equal, `i` is added to the list `arr`.
   - If `p_maxi | p_i` is less, `arr` is reset to `[i]`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Element in `arr`**:
   - The third loop iterates through the list `arr` to find the index `mini` of the element that, when ORed with itself, is the smallest among all elements in `arr`.
   - This is done by comparing `p_mini | p_mini` with `p_item | p_item` for each `item` in `arr`.
   - If `p_item | p_item` is smaller, `mini` is updated to `item`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Finding the Maximum Element**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the element that, when ORed with itself, is the largest. This is because `p_i | p_i` is simply `p_i` for any `i`, and the loop finds the maximum value of `p_i`.

- **Finding Elements with the Same OR Value**:
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices `i` such that `p_maxi | p_i` is equal to `p_maxi | p_arr[0]`. This ensures that all elements that can potentially maximize the XOR with `maxi` are collected in `arr`.

- **Finding the Minimum Element in `arr`**:
  - The third loop correctly identifies the index `mini` of the element in `arr` that, when ORed with itself, is the smallest. This is because `p_item | p_item` is simply `p_item` for any `item`, and the loop finds the minimum value of `p_item` in `arr`.

- **Outputting the Result**:
  - The function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini`, which should maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j` because `maxi` is the index of the largest element, and `mini` is the index of the smallest element that can potentially maximize the XOR with `maxi`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is `3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints, and it uses the allowed number of queries to find the desired indices. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
