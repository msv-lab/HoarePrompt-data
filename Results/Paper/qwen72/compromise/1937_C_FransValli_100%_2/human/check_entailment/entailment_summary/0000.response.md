### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function starts by iterating over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `maxi` to 0, which will hold the index of the maximum element found so far.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find the maximum element by comparing \( p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{maxi}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \). If \( p_i \mid p_i \) is greater, `maxi` is updated to \( i \).
   - After finding the maximum element, it initializes an array `arr` with the index 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to \( n-1 \) again to find all indices that have the same value as the maximum element by comparing \( p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{arr}[0]} \) with \( p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i \). If they are equal, \( i \) is added to `arr`.
   - Finally, it finds the minimum element among the elements in `arr` by comparing \( p_{\text{mini}} \mid p_{\text{mini}} \) with \( p_{\text{item}} \mid p_{\text{item}} \). If \( p_{\text{item}} \mid p_{\text{item}} \) is less, `mini` is updated to `item`.
   - The function outputs the pair \( (\text{maxi}, \text{mini}) \) as the indices that maximize the XOR operation.

3. **Query Analysis**:
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find the maximum element.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find all elements equal to the maximum element.
   - The third loop makes up to \( n-1 \) queries to find the minimum element among the equal elements.
   - The total number of queries is \( 3(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
   - It then finds all elements that are equal to the maximum element.
   - Finally, it finds the minimum element among these equal elements.
   - The pair \( (\text{maxi}, \text{mini}) \) will indeed maximize the XOR operation because the XOR of the maximum element with any other element in the permutation will be maximized when the other element is the minimum among the equal elements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
