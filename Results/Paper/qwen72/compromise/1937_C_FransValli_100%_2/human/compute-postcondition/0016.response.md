Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string. The initial state specifies that if `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 2; otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` and the potential change in `maxi` based on the new input.
