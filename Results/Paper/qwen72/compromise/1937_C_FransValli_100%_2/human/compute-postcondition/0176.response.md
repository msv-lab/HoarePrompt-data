Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string. The list `arr` will contain the indices of all elements that were either equal to or less than the previous elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`). If `res` is '<' for any element, that element will be the only element in `arr`. If `res` is '=' for any element, that element will be appended to `arr`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=' for all elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`.**
