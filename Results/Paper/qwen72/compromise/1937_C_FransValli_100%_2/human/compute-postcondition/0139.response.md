The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1 and `res` is '<'.**
