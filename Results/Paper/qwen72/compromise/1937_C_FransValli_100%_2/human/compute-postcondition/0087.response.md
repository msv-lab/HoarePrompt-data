Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is greater than 1, but its exact value is not provided.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `arr` is explicitly given as `[0]`.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr`, which is `0`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Since `arr` is `[0]` and there is no comparison that resulted in `res` being '<', `maxi` is not defined.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Since `arr` is `[0]` and there is no comparison that resulted in `res` being '>', `mini` is the first element of `arr`, which is `0`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The first element of `arr` is `0`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is not defined, so it will be `None`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string with the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
   - Since `maxi` is `None`, it will be printed as `None`.
   - `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? None 0 None 1**
