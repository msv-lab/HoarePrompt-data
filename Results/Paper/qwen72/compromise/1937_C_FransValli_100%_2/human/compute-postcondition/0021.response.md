The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will start with `i` set to 1 by the `range` function.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
