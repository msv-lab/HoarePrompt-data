Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
   - `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
   - `res` is an input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `maxi` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
     - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` remains 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `maxi` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice.
   - Since `i` is 3, the last two values will always be 3.
   - The value of `maxi` will be either 2 or 0 based on the value of `res`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
     - Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.
     - Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be one of the following:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3 (if res is '<')**
Output: **? 0 0 3 3 (if res is not '<')**
