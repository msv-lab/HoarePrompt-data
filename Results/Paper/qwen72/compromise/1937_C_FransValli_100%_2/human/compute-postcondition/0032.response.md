Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `res` is an input string.
  - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [1].
  - If `res` is '=', then `arr` also contains [1].
  - If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**: The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value precisely.
2. **`arr[0]`**: The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
   - If `res` is '<' or '=', then `arr` is [1], so `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', then `arr` remains unchanged, and we do not have information about its initial state, so `arr[0]` is unknown.
3. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is '<' or '=':
  - `arr[0]` is 1.
  - The output will be: `? [maxi] 1 [maxi] 2` (where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi`).

- If `res` is not '<' or '=':
  - The value of `arr[0]` is unknown.
  - The output will be: `? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2` (where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi` and `[arr[0]]` is the value of `arr[0]`).

### Final Output:
Since `maxi` is not defined and `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`, we can only provide a general description of the output.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the value of `maxi` and [arr[0]] is 1 if `res` is '<' or '=', otherwise [arr[0]] is unknown)**
