The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**
