The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for `_` since it is a temporary variable used within the loop. However, the input value must be adjusted to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be at least 1**
