Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least four elements.
   - `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is determined based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is not '>', then `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
     - If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?' followed by the values of `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is not '>', the output will be:
     ```
     Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where arr[0] is the first element of arr and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**
     ```
   - If `res` is '>', the output will be:
     ```
     Output: **? [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where arr[2] is the third element of arr and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**
     ```

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- **If `res` is not '>':**
  Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where arr[0] is the first element of arr and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**

- **If `res` is '>':**
  Output: **? [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where arr[2] is the third element of arr and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**

To provide a single, precise answer, we can state both possibilities:

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where mini is the first element of arr if res is not '>', otherwise mini is the third element of arr, and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**
