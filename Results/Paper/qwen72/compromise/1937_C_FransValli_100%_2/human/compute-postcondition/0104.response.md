Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 3.
2. `i` is 3.
3. `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
4. `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
5. If `res` is '<':
   - `arr` is `[2]` and `item` is `2`.
6. If `res` is not '<' and not '=':
   - `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]` and `item` is `0` or `1`.
7. If `res` is '=':
   - `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]` and `item` is `0` or `1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[2]` and `maxi` would be 0 (since `arr` has only one element).
   - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` can be `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`, and `maxi` would be 0 or 1 depending on the last comparison.
   - If `res` is '=', `arr` can be `[0, 1, 2]`, `[0, 2]`, or `[1, 2]`, and `maxi` would be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the last comparison.

2. **`arr[0]`**:
   - This is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[2]` and `arr[0]` is 2.
   - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` can be `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`, and `arr[0]` would be 0 or 1.
   - If `res` is '=', `arr` can be `[0, 1, 2]`, `[0, 2]`, or `[1, 2]`, and `arr[0]` would be 0 or 1.

3. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `res` is '<':**
   - `arr` is `[2]`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr[0]` is 2.
   - The print statement will be: `print('?', 0, 2, 0, 3, flush=True)`.

2. **If `res` is not '<' and not '=':**
   - `arr` can be `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`.
   - `maxi` can be 0 or 1.
   - `arr[0]` can be 0 or 1.
   - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, 3, flush=True)` where `maxi` is 0 or 1 and `arr[0]` is 0 or 1.

3. **If `res` is '=':**
   - `arr` can be `[0, 1, 2]`, `[0, 2]`, or `[1, 2]`.
   - `maxi` can be 0, 1, or 2.
   - `arr[0]` can be 0 or 1.
   - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, 3, flush=True)` where `maxi` is 0, 1, or 2 and `arr[0]` is 0 or 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the value of `res`. Here are the possible outputs:

- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 0 2 0 3**

- If `res` is not '<' and not '=':
  Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3** (where `maxi` is 0 or 1 and `arr[0]` is 0 or 1)

- If `res` is '=':
  Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3** (where `maxi` is 0, 1, or 2 and `arr[0]` is 0 or 1)

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't determine a single precise output. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be one of the above formats.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3** (where `maxi` and `arr[0]` depend on the value of `res` as described)
