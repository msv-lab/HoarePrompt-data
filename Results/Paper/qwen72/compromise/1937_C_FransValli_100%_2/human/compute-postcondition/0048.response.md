Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer at least 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark (`?`).
   - It will then print the value of `mini` twice.
   - It will then print the value of `item` twice.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`.

Since `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `mini` and `item` are well-defined and will be printed as part of the output.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the second element of the list `arr`)**
