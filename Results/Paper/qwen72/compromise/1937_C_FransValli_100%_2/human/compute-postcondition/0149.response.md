Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `n` remains the same input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
- `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
- `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
