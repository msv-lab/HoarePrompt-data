Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 3 elements. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the third element of `arr`, and `item` is the third element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the second element of `arr`, and `item` remains the third element of `arr`.***
