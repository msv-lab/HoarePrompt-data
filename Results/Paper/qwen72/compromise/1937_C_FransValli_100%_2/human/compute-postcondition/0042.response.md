Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2, 3]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [1, 2, 3]. Otherwise, `arr` is [3].** 

The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `arr`. Depending on the value of `res`, `arr` could have been [2] or [1, 2] before the code execution. After the code execution, `arr` is updated to [2, 3] if `res` is '<', to [1, 2, 3] if `res` is '=', or to [3] if `res` is anything else. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
