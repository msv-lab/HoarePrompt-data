Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` must have at least three elements.
   - `item` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is `">"`, `mini` is set to the second element of `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `arr` must have at least three elements, we can denote the elements of `arr` as `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`.
   - `item` is the third element of `arr`, so `item` is `arr[2]`.
   - The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `">"`, then `mini` is set to the second element of `arr`, which is `arr[1]`. If `res` is not `">"`, the value of `mini` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine it.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.
   - If `res` is `">"`, `mini` will be `arr[1]` and `item` will be `arr[2]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `">"`, the output will be:
     ```
     ? arr[1] arr[1] arr[2] arr[2]
     ```
   - If `res` is not `">"`, the value of `mini` is undefined, so we cannot determine the exact output.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the second element of `arr` if `res` is `">"`, and [item] is the third element of `arr`)**
