Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string. The list `arr` will contain the indices of all elements that were either equal to or less than the previous elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`). If `res` is '<' for any element, that element will be the only element in `arr`. If `res` is '=' for any element, that element will be appended to `arr`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=' for all elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, and the list `arr` will contain the indices of elements that were either equal to or less than the previous elements in the list. If any element was found to be less than the previous element, `arr` will contain only that element. If elements were found to be equal, they will be appended to `arr`. If no elements were found to be less than or equal to the previous elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`.
