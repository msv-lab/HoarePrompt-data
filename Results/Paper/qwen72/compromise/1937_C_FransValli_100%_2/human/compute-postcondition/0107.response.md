The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `arr`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[2, 3]` and `item` is `2`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` is `[0, 3]` or `[1, 3]` or `[0, 1, 3]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. If `res` is '=', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]` or `[0, 2, 3]` or `[1, 2, 3]` and `item` is `0` or `1`.
