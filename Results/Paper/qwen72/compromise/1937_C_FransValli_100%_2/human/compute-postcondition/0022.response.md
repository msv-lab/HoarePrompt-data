To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. **`maxi`**: The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown. We will represent it as `maxi` in the output.
3. **`arr[0]`**: The variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `arr[0]` is unknown. We will represent it as `arr[0]` in the output.
4. **`maxi`**: Again, the value of `maxi` is unknown.
5. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, the value of `arr[0]`, the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i` which is 1. Since `maxi` and `arr[0]` are not explicitly defined, we will use their variable names to represent their values.

Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi 1**
