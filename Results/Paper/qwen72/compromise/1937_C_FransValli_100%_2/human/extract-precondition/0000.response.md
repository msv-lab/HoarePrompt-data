Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
