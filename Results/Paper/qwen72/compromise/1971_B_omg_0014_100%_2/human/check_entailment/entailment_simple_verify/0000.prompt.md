You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function should be called in a loop or similar structure to process each test case.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed `n` test cases, where for each test case: if the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s` depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order or not. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated for each iteration based on the current string `s`, but their values will not persist outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always produce a valid rearranged string that is not equal to the original string `s`. Specifically, the logic for generating the rearranged string is flawed. The program sorts the string `s` and checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it outputs the reverse sorted string `c`; otherwise, it outputs the sorted string `b`.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the output string `r` will always be different from `s` for all valid cases. For example, consider the string `s = "abba"`. The sorted string `b` will be `"aabb"`, which is different from `s`, but the reverse sorted string `c` will be `"bbaa"`, which is also different from `s`. However, the program will output `"aabb"`, which is a valid rearrangement, but it is not guaranteed to always produce a valid rearrangement.

A more robust approach would be to check if the string can be rearranged (i.e., if it has more than one distinct character) and then generate a rearranged string by swapping any two different characters. This would ensure that the output string is always different from the original string `s` when it is possible to do so.
