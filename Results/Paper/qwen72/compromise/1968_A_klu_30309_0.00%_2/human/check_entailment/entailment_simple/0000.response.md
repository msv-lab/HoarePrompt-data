### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find such a \( y \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately.
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The function correctly identifies the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - However, the condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is used to return \( y \) early if it satisfies this condition. This condition ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a reasonable heuristic to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function will return 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 3 \), the function will return 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 4 \), the function will return 2, which is correct because \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function will return 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).

5. **General Case:**
   - For any \( x \), the function will either return a \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \) or the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
   - The largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) is a good candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because it ensures \( \gcd(x, y) \) is as large as possible.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function appears to correctly implement the logic to find the optimal \( y \) based on the given constraints and problem description.
   - The early return condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is a valid optimization that ensures the function returns a value that is likely to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
