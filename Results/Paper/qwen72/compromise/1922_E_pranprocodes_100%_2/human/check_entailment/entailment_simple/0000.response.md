### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, where `X` is a given integer in the range [2, 10^18].
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of elements that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order in the original array.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases and print the results accordingly.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `X` and initializes `max` and `min` to 100,000,000 and -100,000,000, respectively.
   - It then constructs an array `ans` by repeatedly:
     - If `X` is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `X` by 2.
     - If `X` is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from `X`.
   - The loop continues until `X` becomes 1.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the array `t` and the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Handling of `X`**: The loop ensures that `X` is reduced to 1 by either dividing by 2 (if even) or subtracting 1 (if odd). This is a valid approach to reduce `X` to 1.
   - **Array Length**: The loop will run at most `log_2(X) + X - 1` times, which is always less than 200 for the given range of `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). Therefore, the length of the array `ans` will not exceed 200.
   - **Array Elements**: The elements of `ans` are within the range [-10^9, 10^9] because `max` and `min` are initialized to 100,000,000 and -100,000,000, respectively, and are only decremented or incremented by 1.
   - **Increasing Subsequences**: The construction of the array ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. This is because:
     - Appending `max` (and decrementing `max`) ensures that the new element is greater than all previous elements, thus creating new subsequences.
     - Appending `min` (and incrementing `min`) ensures that the new element is less than or equal to the previous elements, thus not creating new subsequences but reducing `X` by 1.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **X = 2**: The function will append `max` once and then `X` will be 1, resulting in an array with one element.
   - **X = 3**: The function will append `min` once and then `max` once, resulting in an array with two elements.
   - **X = 10^18**: The function will handle this large value correctly by repeatedly dividing by 2 and subtracting 1, ensuring the array length does not exceed 200.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the length of the array `t` and the elements of `ans` in reverse order, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for each test case, and it adheres to the constraints and output format specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
