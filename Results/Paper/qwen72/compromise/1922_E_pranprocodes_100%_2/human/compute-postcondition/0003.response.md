Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each `X`, it generates and prints an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It also prints the number of elements in the array. If `X` is 1, it prints 0 and an empty array. The function does not return any value. **
