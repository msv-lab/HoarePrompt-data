Output State: **The loop executes for each test case, and for each `X`, it prints the number of elements in the resulting array `t` and the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The variables `max` and `min` are updated based on the operations inside the loop, but their final values depend on the specific value of `X`. The array `ans` will contain at most 200 elements, and the elements will be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `X` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `t` will be 0, with `ans` being an empty array.**
