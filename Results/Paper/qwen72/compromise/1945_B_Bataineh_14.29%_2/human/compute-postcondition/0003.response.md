The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept multiple test cases, each with three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. These parameters are integers, and they are constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function likely processes these parameters to produce a result for each test case.

However, without the actual function signature or the output details, it's not possible to definitively describe the return value. Assuming the function processes each test case and returns a result for each, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), and returns a result for each test case.**
