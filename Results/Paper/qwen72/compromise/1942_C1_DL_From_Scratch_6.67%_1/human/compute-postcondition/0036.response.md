Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is 1 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` updates the value of `num` based on the difference between the next element and the current element in `list0`, minus 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, `count`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is 1, so `num` is calculated as `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`.
- The conditions and values of the other variables remain as specified in the initial state.
