To determine what will be printed by the `print(count + x - 2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.
   - `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `x` is greater than 1, so `x > 1`.
   - `i` is `x - 2`, which means `i` is a positive integer since `x > 1`.
   - `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, where `list0[-1]` is the last element of the list `list0`.
   - `count` is initially some value, and it may or may not be incremented based on the value of `num`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.
   - If `num` is not 1, `count` remains unchanged.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression `count + x - 2` is evaluated.
   - Since `i` is `x - 2`, the expression simplifies to `count + i`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `count + i` will be printed.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.
   - `count` could be either the original value of `count` or `count + 1` depending on the value of `num`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **count + (x - 2) (where count is the value of count after the condition check, and x is greater than 1)**
