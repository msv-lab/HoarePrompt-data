The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such functions would return or print a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the upper limit of the range of integers.
  - `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), representing the number of distinct integers chosen.
  - `y` is always 0.
  - A list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` is provided, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It processes each test case and returns or prints a result based on the given parameters and the list of integers.**
