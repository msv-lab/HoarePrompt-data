The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is an input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1' characters, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
