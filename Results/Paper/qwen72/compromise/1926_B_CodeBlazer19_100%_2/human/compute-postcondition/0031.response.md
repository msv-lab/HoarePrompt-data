Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(b)
```

Given that `b` can be either an empty string (`""`) or the string `'SQUARE'`, the output will depend on the value of `b` at the time the `print` statement is executed. Since the initial state does not specify which of these two values `b` actually holds, we must consider both possibilities.

However, since the task is to determine exactly what will be printed, and the initial state does not provide a specific value for `b`, the most precise description we can give is:

Output: **b (where b is either an empty string or 'SQUARE')**
