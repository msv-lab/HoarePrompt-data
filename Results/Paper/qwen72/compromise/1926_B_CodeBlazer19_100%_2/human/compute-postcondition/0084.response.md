The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is a new input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
