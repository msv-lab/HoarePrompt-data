Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means an input string `s` had exactly one '1'. If `a` is 0, it means no input string `s` had exactly one '1'. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string.***
