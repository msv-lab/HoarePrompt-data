Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` retains its initial value.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the string 'TRIANGLE' to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `a` while keeping all other variables the same.
