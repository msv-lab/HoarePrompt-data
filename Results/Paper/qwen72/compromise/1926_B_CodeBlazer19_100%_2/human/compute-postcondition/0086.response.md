Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', and `b` will be determined based on the count of '1' in the new `s`. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `b` is an empty string.**
