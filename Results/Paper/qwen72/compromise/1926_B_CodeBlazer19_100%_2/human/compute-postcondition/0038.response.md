Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is an input string.** 

The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `s` which is an input string.
