Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is 'TRIANGLE', indicating that at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop.
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Given that `a` is explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE', the output will be:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
