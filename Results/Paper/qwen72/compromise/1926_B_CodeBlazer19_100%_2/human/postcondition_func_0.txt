The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid represents a "TRIANGLE" or a "SQUARE" based on the pattern of '1's. A "TRIANGLE" is identified if any row in the grid has exactly one '1', while a "SQUARE" is identified if any row has more than one '1'. If no row has exactly one '1', the function defaults to printing "SQUARE". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
