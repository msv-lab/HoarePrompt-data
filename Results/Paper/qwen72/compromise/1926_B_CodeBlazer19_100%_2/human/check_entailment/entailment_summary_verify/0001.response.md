### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Shape Detection Logic**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's in the row.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in Logic**:
   - **Triangle Detection**: The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively, but the function would only detect the first row as a triangle and miss the others.
   - **Square Detection**: The logic for detecting a square is also flawed. A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if it is a very small square (e.g., 2x2). The current logic assumes that any row with more than one '1' is part of a square, which is not always true. For example, a triangle with `k=2` would have rows with 1 and 3 '1's, and the function would incorrectly identify it as a square.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, we need to check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers centered around a column.
   - To correctly identify a square, we need to check if each row has the same number of consecutive '1's starting from the same column.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the logic of the provided program. The program does not accurately detect triangles or squares based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
