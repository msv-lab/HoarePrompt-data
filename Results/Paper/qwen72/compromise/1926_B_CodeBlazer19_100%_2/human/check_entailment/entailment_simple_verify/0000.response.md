Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic for identifying shapes is overly simplistic and does not adhere to the specific definitions of triangles and squares provided in the problem statement. The program only checks the number of '1's in each row to decide the shape, which is insufficient. For example, a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and a square can have a single '1' in a row, depending on the orientation and position within the grid. The program fails to check the structural properties of the shapes, such as the pattern of '1's forming a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
