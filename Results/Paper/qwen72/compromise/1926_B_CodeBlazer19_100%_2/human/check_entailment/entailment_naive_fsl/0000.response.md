Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and more than one '1' to identify a square. However, this approach fails to account for the specific structure of triangles and squares as defined in the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
0000
0100
1110
0000
```
This input represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the third row contains three '1's, which triggers the `b = 'SQUARE'` condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
