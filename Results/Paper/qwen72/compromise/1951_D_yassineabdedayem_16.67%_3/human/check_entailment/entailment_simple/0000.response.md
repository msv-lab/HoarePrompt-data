### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice has `n` coins and needs to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys jewels greedily from each stall until she can't afford more.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` (number of stalls set up), `number` (price per jewel), and `tab` (list of prices).

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs while `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - It calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends the string representation of `number` to `tab`.
   - It decreases `n` by `Min * Max` and increments `rep`.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle cases where `n` is less than `k` (impossible to buy `k` jewels).
   - The program should handle cases where `k` is 1 (Alice can always buy one jewel if `n` is at least 1).
   - The program should handle cases where `k` is greater than 60 (impossible to set up more than 60 stalls).

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The loop condition ensures that the program does not exceed 60 stalls.
   - The logic for setting `number` and updating `n` and `k` is designed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - However, the condition `n * Min <= k` in the if statement is incorrect. It should be `n >= Min * k` to ensure Alice can afford the jewels.

7. **Corrected Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be `n >= Min * k` instead of `n * Min <= k`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        rep = 0
        tab = []
        
        while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
            Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(n // k, k)
            if n >= Min * k:
                number = Min
                k = k - Max
            else:
                number = Max
                k = k - Min
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= Min * Max
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            print(' '.join(tab))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The condition `n >= Min * k` ensures that Alice can afford to buy `k` jewels at the price `Min`.
- This fix ensures that the program correctly handles the greedy buying behavior and the constraints of the problem.
