Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied.
   - `n` is the final value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration.
   - `i` is `None`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
