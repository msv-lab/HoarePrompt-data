Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and must be greater than zero, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than zero is still valid.
- The condition that `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k` is still valid.
- The condition that `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1 is still valid.
