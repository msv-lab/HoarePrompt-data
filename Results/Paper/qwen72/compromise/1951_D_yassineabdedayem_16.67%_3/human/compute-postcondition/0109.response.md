Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `number` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the value of the minimum between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the value of the maximum between `n // k` and `k`.
- All other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `number`) remain unchanged.
