Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is now `k - Max`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
