The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but the function signature does not include these parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should accept parameters related to the test cases and the values `n` and `k`. Given the context, the function likely accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` as parameters. The constraints indicate that `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers. The function's output is not specified, but typically in such scenarios, the function would process each test case and return a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
