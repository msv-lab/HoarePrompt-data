Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` and `k` are the new values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None` (since `k` is 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is 0. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), and `Min` and `Max` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is not 0, and `n` and `k` are the new values read from the input.**
