Output State: **`rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied, `n` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration, `i` is `None` (since `k` is 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`rep`**: This variable will be 60 if the loop runs to its maximum iteration limit, or it will be less than 60 if the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied before reaching 60 iterations.
- **`n`**: This is the final value of `n` after all iterations of the loop. It will be updated by subtracting `Min * Max` in each iteration.
- **`k`**: This is the final value of `k` after all iterations of the loop. It will be updated by either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition in the loop.
- **`t`**: This variable is initially greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. It will be greater than 0 but reduced by the number of iterations the loop ran.
- **`tab`**: This is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable remains `None` because `k` is either 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and `i` is only updated to the last element of `tab` if `k` is 0.
- **`Min` and `Max`**: These are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, before the loop terminated.
- **`number`**: This is the last value assigned to `number` during the loop, based on the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min`; otherwise, `number` is `Max`.
