Postcondition: ***`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.***
