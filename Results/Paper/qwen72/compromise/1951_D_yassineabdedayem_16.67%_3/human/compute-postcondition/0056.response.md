Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0 (which is `None` since `tab` is empty), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration, and `number` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab = []` initializes `tab` as an empty list, overriding any previous content.
- Since `tab` is now an empty list, `i` (which is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0) will be `None`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `_`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
