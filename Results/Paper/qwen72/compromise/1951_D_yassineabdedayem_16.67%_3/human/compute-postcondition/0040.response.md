Let's analyze the initial state step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met).
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.
   - Additionally, `k` is 0.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant string, the output will be exactly `YES`.

Output: **YES**
