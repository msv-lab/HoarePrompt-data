The given `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, or `Max`.

Output: **NO**
