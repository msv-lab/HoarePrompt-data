Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the minimum value between `n // k` (integer division) and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the maximum value between `int(n / k)` (integer division, which is the same as `n // k` for non-negative `n`) and `k`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`) remain unchanged.
