Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
