Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the final values after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is `None` (since `k` is 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), and `tab` has been fully iterated. If `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `None`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The loop has executed `t` times, and since `t` is decremented by the number of iterations, it is now 0.
- **`n` and `k` are the final values after all iterations of the loop**: These values have been updated multiple times within the loop, and they represent the final state after all iterations.
- **`rep` is 60 or less**: The loop ensures that `rep` does not exceed 60. If the loop exits due to `rep` reaching 60, it will be exactly 60. Otherwise, it will be less than 60 if the loop exits due to other conditions.
- **`tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration**: This list has been populated with the string representations of the numbers computed during each iteration of the loop.
- **`i` is `None`**: The variable `i` is only used within the loop to print elements of `tab` if `k` is 0. Outside the loop, `i` is not relevant and is `None`.
- **`Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively**: These variables hold the last computed values of the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k` from the last iteration of the loop.
- **`number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop**: This variable holds the last value of `number` that was computed and appended to `tab` during the loop.
- **If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), and `tab` has been fully iterated**: If the loop exits with `k` being 0, the `YES` and the contents of `tab` are printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`.
- **If `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `None`**: If the loop exits with `k` still being a positive integer, the `NO` message is printed, and `i` is `None` because `tab` is not fully iterated.
