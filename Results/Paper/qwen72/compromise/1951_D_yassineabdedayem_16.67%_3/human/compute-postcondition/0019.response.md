Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the value of the minimum between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the value of the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain valid as specified in the initial state.
