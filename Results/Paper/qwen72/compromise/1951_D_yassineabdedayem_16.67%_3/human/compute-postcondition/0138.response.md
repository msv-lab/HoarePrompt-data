Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and is now equal to `n - Min * Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- `rep` remains 2.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
- `tab` remains a list containing three string representations of `number`.
- `i` remains `None`.
- `Min` remains `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`.
- The conditions for updating `k` and `number` remain the same:
  - If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.
