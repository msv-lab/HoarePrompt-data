Postcondition: **`rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied, `n` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration, `i` is `None`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.**
