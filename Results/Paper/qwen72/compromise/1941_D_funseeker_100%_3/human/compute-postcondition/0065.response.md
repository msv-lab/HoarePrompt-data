The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Let's break down the impact:

- `n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?'.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.
- `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.
- `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.

After executing the code snippet:

- The value `(q + r) % n` is calculated and added to the set `temp`.
- The set `temp` now contains the value `(q + r) % n` in addition to any other values it already contained.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?', `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and any other values it already contained.**
