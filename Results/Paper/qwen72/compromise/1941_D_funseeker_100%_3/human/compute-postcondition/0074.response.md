The value `n` is added to the set `ans`. Since `n` was not previously in the set, `ans` now contains all its previous elements plus `n`. The constraints and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', for each of the `m` iterations, but 0 is no longer in the set, and `n` is now included in the set `ans`.**
