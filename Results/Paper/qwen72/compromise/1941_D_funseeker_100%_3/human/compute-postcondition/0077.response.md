To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `m` is an integer with the constraint \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer with the constraint \(1 \leq x \leq n\).
   - `ans` is a set that evolves over `m` iterations.

2. **Evolution of `ans`**:
   - Initially, `ans` contains the value `x`.
   - For each of the `m` iterations:
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` is updated to include all unique values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each `q` in the current `ans` and each `r` in the current `ans`.
     - If `c` is '0', `ans` is updated to include all unique values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) for each `q` in the current `ans` and each `r` in the current `ans`.
   - After each iteration, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is included in `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain a set of unique values.
   - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of `ans`.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The set `ans` starts with a single value `x`.
   - Depending on the value of `c`, the set `ans` will grow by including more values derived from the current elements.
   - The operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) ensure that the values remain within the range \([0, n-1]\).
   - If `0` is ever included in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added.
   - The set `ans` will eventually contain a subset of values from \([1, n-1]\) and possibly `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of `ans`.
   - Since `0` is removed and `n` is added if `0` is present, the final set `ans` will not contain `0` but may contain `n`.

Given the constraints and the operations, the exact values in `ans` depend on the initial value of `x` and the value of `c` for each iteration. However, the final output will be a sorted list of unique values from the set `ans`.

Output: **sorted list of unique values from the set `ans` (where `ans` contains values derived from the operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) if `c` is '1' or '?', or \((q + r) \% n\) if `c` is '0', and does not include `0` but may include `n`)**
