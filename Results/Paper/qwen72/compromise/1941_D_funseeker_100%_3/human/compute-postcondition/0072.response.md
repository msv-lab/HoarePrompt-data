Postcondition: **`n` remains unchanged with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', for each of the `m` iterations. `r` and `c` are the integer and string values, respectively, returned by `func_1().split()` during each iteration of the loop. The set `ans` contains the value 0.**
