The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `m`. The loop will execute one more time if `m` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a fixed number of times, it does not need to be explicitly stated in the state. However, `m` must be considered to determine if the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1, but since `_` is not used, we only need to consider `m`.

State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'**
