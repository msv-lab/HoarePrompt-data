Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values, which are constrained as specified in the initial state.
- `ans` is a set that contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. This means that for each value `q` in the initial `ans`, the loop has added the results of the specified operations to `ans`.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial values, which are derived from the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `temp` is a set that contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. This set `temp` is the result of the loop's operations on the initial set `ans`.
