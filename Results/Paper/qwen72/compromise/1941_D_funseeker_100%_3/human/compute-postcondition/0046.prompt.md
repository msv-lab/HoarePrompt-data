Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or at least one unique value of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and `q` is the first element in `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or at least two unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional value `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0', and `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional value `(q + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least three unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or at least three unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional value `(q + r) % n`, and `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', the value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
