### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - `func_2()` and `func_3()` are helper functions to parse integers and lists of integers from the input, respectively.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function `func_4()` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`, which will keep track of the possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`, representing a clockwise throw.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`, representing a counterclockwise throw.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0**:
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` to ensure the player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic for handling each throw is correct. It correctly considers both possible directions for throws marked with '?'.
  - The use of sets ensures that each player is only counted once, and the `% n` operation correctly wraps around the circle of players.
  - The edge case for player `0` is handled correctly by replacing `0` with `n`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '0', '1', or '?'.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the ball could end up with player `n` (which is represented as `0` in the set).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of sets and the `% n` operation ensures that the program runs efficiently, even for the maximum constraints of `n` and `m`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and handles all the given requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
