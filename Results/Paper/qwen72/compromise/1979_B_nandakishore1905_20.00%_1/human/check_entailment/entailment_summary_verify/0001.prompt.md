You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user. It then calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of two less than or equal to `k` and prints the difference between `k` and this power of two. The function does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` mentioned in the comments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \( a \) and \( b \) defined as:
     - \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
     - \( b_n = n \oplus y \)
   - The sequences are infinite, and we need to find the maximum integer \( m \) such that \( a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, \ldots, a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1} \) for some \( i, j \ge 1 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are generated by applying the XOR operation with fixed values \( x \) and \( y \) to the index \( n \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, and \( n \oplus x \oplus y = n \oplus (x \oplus y) \).
   - Therefore, \( a_n = b_n \) if and only if \( n \oplus x = n \oplus y \), which simplifies to \( x = y \). Since \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct, \( a_n \neq b_n \) for all \( n \).
   - However, we are looking for the longest common subsegment, not just individual matching elements.

3. **Common Subsegment Analysis:**
   - For \( a_i \) and \( b_j \) to be equal, \( i \oplus x = j \oplus y \). Rearranging, we get \( i \oplus j = x \oplus y \).
   - The length of the common subsegment will be the number of consecutive integers \( n \) such that \( (i + k) \oplus x = (j + k) \oplus y \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, m-1 \).
   - This simplifies to \( (i + k) \oplus (j + k) = x \oplus y \).

4. **Pattern in XOR:**
   - The XOR of two consecutive integers \( n \) and \( n+1 \) is always 1 (since \( n \oplus (n+1) = 1 \)).
   - Therefore, the length of the common subsegment is determined by the number of consecutive 1s in the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( k = |x - y| \), which is incorrect. The correct value to consider is \( k = x \oplus y \).
   - The program checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \). This is correct because a power of 2 in binary has a single 1 followed by zeros.
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \), which is correct.
   - If \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be based on the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
   - If \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is even, it prints 2, which is also incorrect. The correct condition should be based on the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the length of the binary representation of \( k \) and prints \( k - 2^{(p-1)} \), which is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s in the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s in the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
   - This can be done by converting \( x \oplus y \) to its binary form and counting the maximum number of consecutive 1s.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has several issues:
- It incorrectly calculates \( k \) as \( |x - y| \) instead of \( x \oplus y \).
- The conditions for handling \( n == 0 \) are incorrect and should be based on the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
- The final calculation for the length of the common subsegment is incorrect and should be based on the longest sequence of consecutive 1s in the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
