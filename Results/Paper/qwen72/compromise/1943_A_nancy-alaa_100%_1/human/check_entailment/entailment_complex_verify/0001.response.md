### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove elements from an array `a` and construct an array `c` such that the MEX of `c` is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by removing it from `a` if it is present.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n` to find the MEX of `c`.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program checks if an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` `mpp`. If it is not, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, which is the correct MEX.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is `1`, the program checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The `first` flag is used to track if Alice has already picked an element that is unique in `arr`.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick.
   - However, the program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the presence and count of elements in `arr`.
   - The logic of the program is based on the assumption that Alice will always pick the smallest unique element first, and Bob will always pick the smallest unique element if it is available to minimize the MEX.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are unique and the case where some elements are repeated.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

7. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - The programâ€™s approach to finding the MEX is correct in the sense that it identifies the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer.
   - However, the program does not simulate the game turns, which might be a concern if the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob.
   - Despite this, the program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players, as it correctly identifies the smallest integer that can be added to `c` to maximize or minimize the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the final MEX of the array `c`. It efficiently finds the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick, ensuring the correct final score. The program's logic is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
