### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x` for each case.

2. **Binary Representation**: It initializes a list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with a fixed length of 30 bits. This is appropriate because \( x < 2^{30} \).

3. **Bitwise Conversion**: The program correctly converts the integer `x` into its binary representation by checking each bit using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`). This ensures that the list `s` contains '1' for bits that are set and '0' for bits that are not set.

4. **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Bits**: The program then processes the list `s` to ensure that no two adjacent non-zero bits exist. It does this by iterating through the list and setting flags to handle carry-over operations. Specifically:
   - If a '1' is followed by another '1', it changes the current '1' to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate a carry-over.
   - If a carry-over flag is set and the next bit is '0', it changes the '0' to '1' and clears the flag.
   - If a carry-over flag is set and the next bit is also '1', it continues the carry-over process.

5. **Final Adjustments**: After processing the list, the program checks if there is a carry-over at the last bit. If so, it adjusts the last bit and possibly appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

6. **Output**: The program prints the length of the list `s` and the list itself, which should meet the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to convert the integer `x` into a list of integers `a_i` that satisfy the given conditions. The bitwise conversion and carry-over handling are implemented correctly, ensuring that no two adjacent non-zero bits exist in the final list.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
