Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when converting the binary representation of `x` into the required array `a` with the constraints specified. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
x = 21
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
1 0 -1 0 1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
1 0 0 -1 1
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
The program incorrectly processes the binary representation of `x` and does not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array `a`. In the actual output, the array `[1, 0, 0, -1, 1]` has two consecutive non-zero elements (`-1` and `1`), which violates the constraint that there should not be any index `i` such that both `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` are non-zero.

This failure demonstrates that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
