Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`. If `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was '0', then `s[0]` was changed to '1' and `flag` was set to 0. Now, `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**
