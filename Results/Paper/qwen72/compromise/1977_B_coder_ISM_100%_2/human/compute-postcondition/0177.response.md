The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `30`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Since the loop condition is `i in range(30)`, which is equivalent to `i < 30`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `4` (which is `pow(2, 2)`) is non-zero, `s` contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0'.**
