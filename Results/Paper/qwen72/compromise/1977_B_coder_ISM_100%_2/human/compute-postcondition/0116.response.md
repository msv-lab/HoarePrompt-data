Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` are both '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[i]` is set to '-1', and `s[i + 1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0' and the remaining elements represent the binary form of `x`. If `flag` is 0 and the condition `s[i] == s[i + 1]` and `s[i] == '1'` is not met, the list `s` remains unchanged, and `flag` is still 0.***
