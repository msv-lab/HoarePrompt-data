Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit) is set (1) or not set (0).**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `x` remains an input integer.
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `nalla` remains 0.
- The variable `length` remains 30.
- The loop has completed 30 iterations, so `i` is 29.
- The list `s` now contains 30 elements, where each element represents the binary value of the corresponding bit in `x`. Specifically, if the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, the `i`-th element in `s` is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'. The bits are checked from the least significant bit (position 0) to the most significant bit (position 29).
