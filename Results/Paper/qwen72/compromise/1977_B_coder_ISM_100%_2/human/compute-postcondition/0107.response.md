Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), `flag` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1', and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is also '1'.**
