Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, and `s[1]` is '1'. `flag` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `flag` to 0.
- The initial conditions for `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `s[1]` is '1' remains valid.
- Since `flag` is now explicitly set to 0, the final state reflects this change.
