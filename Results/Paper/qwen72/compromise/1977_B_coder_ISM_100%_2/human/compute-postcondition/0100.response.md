Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented from 0 to 30. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each representing whether the corresponding bit in `x` was set (1) or not (0), starting from the least significant bit (bit 0) up to the most significant bit (bit 29). The other variables (`x`, `t`, `nalla`, and `length`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
