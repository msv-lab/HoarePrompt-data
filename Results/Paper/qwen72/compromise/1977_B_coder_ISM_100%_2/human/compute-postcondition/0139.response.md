Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list of 30 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), with any consecutive '1's replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'. The 29th element of `s` (the most significant bit) is now '1', and `flag` is 1.**
