The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 in `s` will be changed to `'-1'`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where `s[1]` is now `'-1'` and the rest of the elements are either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, and `flag` remains unchanged.**
