Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, but now `s[0]` is '0'. `flag` is 1, and if `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` will be changed to '1' and `flag` will be set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, `s`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
