Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the 30th element of `s` is '-1' and the 29th element of `s` is '1', then the 30th element of `s` is now '0', the 29th element of `s` is '-1', the 28th element of `s` remains '1', and the 27th element of `s` is '-1'. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.***
