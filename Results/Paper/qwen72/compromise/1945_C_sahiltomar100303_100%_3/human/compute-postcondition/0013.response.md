The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0**
