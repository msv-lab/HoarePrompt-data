Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 4, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `n // 2 - 3`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is now less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, `rightOne` remains less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` remains less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**
