The variables in the loop head are `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the conditions `left > 0` and `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` are still met.

1. **Condition `left > 0`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `left` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n // 2 - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n // 2` must be greater than 1. This implies `n` must be greater than 2.

2. **Condition `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.
   - For the loop to execute again, this condition must still hold true. Since `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that after the next iteration, `left` will be `n // 2 - 2`.

Given that `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and the loop body modifies `left` by decrementing it, the next value of `left` will be `n // 2 - 2`. We need to ensure that `left` is still greater than 0 and that the condition `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` still holds.

Since `left` is decremented by 1 in the loop body, we need to ensure that `left` is greater than 0 and that the condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` is still met.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true**
