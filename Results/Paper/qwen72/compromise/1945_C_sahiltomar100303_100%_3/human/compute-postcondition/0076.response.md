Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 4, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` remains less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` remains less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `leftZero` and `rightOne` are still valid, and the initial values and conditions for the other variables are preserved.
