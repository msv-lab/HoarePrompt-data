Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at the position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at the position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '1', then `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1. In both cases, `leftZero` remains less than `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` remains less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**
