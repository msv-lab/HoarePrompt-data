Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true. If the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1. If the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.***
