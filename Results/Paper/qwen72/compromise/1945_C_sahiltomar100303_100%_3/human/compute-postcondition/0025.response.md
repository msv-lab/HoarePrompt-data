Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is 0.**
