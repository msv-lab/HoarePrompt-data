Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and the first character of `s` is not '0'.** 

The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions that `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and the first character of `s` is not '0' are still valid.
