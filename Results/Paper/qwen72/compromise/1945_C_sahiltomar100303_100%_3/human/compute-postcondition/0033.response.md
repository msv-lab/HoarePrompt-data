Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid - 1`. `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and `trightOne` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the variables `leftZero` and `tleftZero` will both hold the count of '0' characters in the first half of the string `s`, and the variables `leftOne` and `tleftOne` will both hold the count of '1' characters in the first half of the string `s`. The variables `rightZero` and `trightZero` will remain 0, as will `rightOne` and `trightOne`, since the loop only processes the first half of the string `s` and does not modify the right side counters. The loop index `i` will be at the last index of the first half of the string, which is `mid - 1`.
