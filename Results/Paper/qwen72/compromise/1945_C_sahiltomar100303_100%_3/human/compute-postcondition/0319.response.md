The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `rightOne` is unknown. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `n` remain unchanged. Since `i` is `mid + 1` and `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than `mid + 1`, these conditions still hold true after the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
