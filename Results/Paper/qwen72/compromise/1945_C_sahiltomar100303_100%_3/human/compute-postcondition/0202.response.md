The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is `tleftZero - 1`.
