Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `n // 2 + 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 1`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `trightZero`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne - 2`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
- The value of `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1` initially, so after `trightOne` is decremented, `rightOne` becomes `trightOne - 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
