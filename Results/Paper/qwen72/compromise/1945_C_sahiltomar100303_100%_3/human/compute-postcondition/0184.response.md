Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If the character at position `i` (which is `mid + 2`) in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` is not '0', then `rightOne` is 2, `trightZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 1, and `trightOne` is 1.**
