Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 6, `left` is `n // 2 - 3`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.**

The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `mid`, `n`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged. The condition that at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true also remains unchanged.
