Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, and the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is '0', and `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is '0', and `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 3. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is '0', and `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` if `s[i]` is not '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
