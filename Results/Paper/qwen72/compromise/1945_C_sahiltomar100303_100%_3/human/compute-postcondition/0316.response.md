The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than `mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `mid + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `mid` is `n // 2` and `n` is greater than `mid`, `i` being `mid + 1` will still be less than `n` if `n` is greater than `mid + 1`.

State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid + 1`**
