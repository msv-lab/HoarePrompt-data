Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `rightZero` is `trightZero - 1`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne`, `right` is `n // 2`, and the character at the position `right` in the string `s` is '0'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, so `rightZero` is now `trightZero - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
