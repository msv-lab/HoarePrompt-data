Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0
   - `n` is greater than `mid`
   - `left` is 0
   - `leftMove` is 0
   - `right` is `n`
   - `leftZero` is 0
   - `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`
   - `rightZero` is 0
   - `rightOne` is 0
   - The current value of `right` is equal to `n`
   - `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(left)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `left` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.
   - No other operations or conditions are provided that modify the value of `left`.

Given this information, the value of `left` is 0, and this is what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

Output: **0**
