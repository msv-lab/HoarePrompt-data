Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 6, `left` is `n // 2 - 3`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.** 

The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `leftZero` and `rightOne` are still valid.
