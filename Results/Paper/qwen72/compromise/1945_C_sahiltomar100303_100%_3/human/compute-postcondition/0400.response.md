Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is not 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is not `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0. If the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `right`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed.***
