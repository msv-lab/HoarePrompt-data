Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, `s` is the third line of the input file, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` is evaluated and added to the existing value of `z`.
- The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0 still holds true.
