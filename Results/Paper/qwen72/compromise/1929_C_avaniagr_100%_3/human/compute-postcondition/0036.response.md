To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `s` is the third line of the input file.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `x < k - 1`:
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds.
     - If `a` is less than `x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds.
   - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part.
     - If `a` is less than `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`:
     - `i` is `x - k + 2`.
     - `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times.
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions.
     - If `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is not conditional on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The statement simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `s`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any conditions or variables, it will always print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
