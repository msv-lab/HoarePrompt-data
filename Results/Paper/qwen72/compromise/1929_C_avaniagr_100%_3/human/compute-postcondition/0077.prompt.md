Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, and `s` is the second line of the input file. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds; if `a` is less than `x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part; if `a` is less than `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times; if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions; if `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, and `s` is the third line of the input file. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a >= x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds; if `a < x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a >= x + 2`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds; if `a < x + 2`, the condition `a < x + 2` holds. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times; if `a >= z`, the condition `a >= z` holds; if `a < z`, the condition `a < z` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, and `s` is the fourth line of the input file. If `x` < `k` - 1, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` == `k` - 1, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` also remain unchanged. If `x` > `k` - 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is the result of the expression `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`, then the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, then the current value of `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
