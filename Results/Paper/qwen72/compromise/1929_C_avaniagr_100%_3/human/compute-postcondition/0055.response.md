Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, and `s` is the fourth line of the input file.**

Explanation:
- The code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` updates the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` based on the fourth line of the input file `s`.
- The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now the first, second, and third integers from the fourth line of the input file, respectively.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `s` remains the fourth line of the input file.
