Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, and `s` is the fourth line of the input file. If `x` < `k` - 1, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` == `k` - 1, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` also remain unchanged. If `x` > `k` - 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is the result of the expression `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`, then the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, then the current value of `a` is less than `z`.***
