Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, `s` is the third line of the input file, `z` is the result of the expression `k - 2 + sum((z // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x - k + 3))`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.**
