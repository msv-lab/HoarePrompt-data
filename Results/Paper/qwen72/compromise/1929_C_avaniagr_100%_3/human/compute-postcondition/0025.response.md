Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an integer where \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
   - `x` is an integer where \(1 \leq x \leq 100\) and \(x \geq k - 2\) and \(x \neq k - 1\).
   - `a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `s` is the second line of the input file.
   - `i` is \(x - k + 2\).
   - `z` is the result of the loop body being applied \(x - k + 3\) times.
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` is a simple statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their constraints, but none of this information directly affects the print statement.
   - The condition that `a` is greater than or equal to `z` is given, but it does not influence the print statement itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `i`, and `z`.

Output: **YES**
