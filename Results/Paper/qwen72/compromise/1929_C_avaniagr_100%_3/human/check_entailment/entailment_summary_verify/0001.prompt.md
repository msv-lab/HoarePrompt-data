You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from standard input, where each line after the first contains three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it checks if `a` meets certain conditions based on the values of `k` and `x`. If `x < k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a >= x + 1` and 'NO' otherwise. If `x == k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a >= x + 2` and 'NO' otherwise. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` using a loop and prints 'YES' if `a >= z` and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where the bet amount is increased by a factor of `k` if he wins and he loses the entire bet amount if he loses.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - The initial number of coins Sasha has is `a`.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will lose a total of `y + 2y + 3y + ... + xy` coins, where `y` is the initial bet amount.
   - If Sasha wins a bet, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - To ensure he can always place bets and eventually win any number of coins, Sasha must have enough coins to cover the maximum possible loss sequence.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The maximum loss sequence is `y + 2y + 3y + ... + xy = y * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x) = y * (x * (x + 1) / 2)`.
   - Sasha needs to have at least `y * (x * (x + 1) / 2)` coins to cover this loss sequence.
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from any loss sequence because he can win back more than he loses in a single win.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the problem becomes more complex, and Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It checks if `x < k - 1` and if `a >= x + 1`. This is correct because if `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from any loss sequence with at least `x + 1` coins.
   - It checks if `x == k - 1` and if `a >= x + 2`. This is also correct because if `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates the minimum number of coins required using a loop. The loop increments `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations. This calculation is intended to determine the minimum number of coins required to cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.
   - The program then checks if `a >= z` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

5. **Correctness of the Calculation:**
   - The calculation `z = k - 2` and the loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the minimum number of coins required to cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.
   - However, this calculation is not correct. The correct approach should be to calculate the sum of the loss sequence and ensure Sasha has enough coins to cover it.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling the case when `x > k - 1` is incorrect. The calculation `z = k - 2` and the loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly determine the minimum number of coins required to cover the loss sequence and still have enough to place another bet.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
