Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. The program attempts to calculate the scores by moving the players according to the permutation and updating their scores, but it does not correctly account for the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Scores:**
   - The program updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the maximum score if the player stays at the current position or moves to the next position. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's rules, where a player can choose to stay or move on each turn.
   - The program incorrectly uses `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` to update the maximum scores, which does not reflect the actual game dynamics.

2. **Incorrect Loop Termination:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` is used, but the variable `k` is decremented inside the loop. This can lead to the loop terminating prematurely if `k` becomes zero before the loop completes, which is not necessary for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Moves:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the decision-making process for each player. Each player can choose to stay or move on each turn, and the program should consider both possibilities to determine the optimal score.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
- Simulate the game for `k` turns, considering both the possibility of staying at the current position and moving to the next position.
- Track the best possible score for each player after `k` turns.
- Compare the final scores to determine the winner.

### Suggested Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust indices to be 0-based
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            # Calculate scores if staying
            bodya_stay = bodya_score + a[b]
            sasha_stay = sasha_score + a[s]
            
            # Calculate scores if moving
            bodya_move = bodya_score + a[p[b] - 1]
            sasha_move = sasha_score + a[p[s] - 1]
            
            # Choose the best score for each player
            bodya_score = max(bodya_stay, bodya_move)
            sasha_score = max(sasha_stay, sasha_move)
            
            # Move to the next position
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Initialization:** The scores for Bodya and Sasha are initialized to zero.
- **Simulation Loop:** For each turn, the program calculates the score if the player stays at the current position and the score if the player moves to the next position. It then chooses the maximum score for each player.
- **Move to Next Position:** After each turn, the player's position is updated to the next position in the permutation.
- **Determine Winner:** After `k` turns, the program compares the final scores to determine the winner.

This approach correctly simulates the game and should produce the correct results for the given problem.
