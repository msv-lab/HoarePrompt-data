The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.**
