Output State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain unchanged; `s` is now `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp);` `sm` is now `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `k` is not 0, otherwise all variables remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `sp` is now `sp + a[s]`.**

Explanation:
- `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `bp`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- If `k` is not 0, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`.
- If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all other variables remain unchanged.
