Output State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged; `s` is now `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is now `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `k` is not 0, otherwise all variables remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, and `sp` remain unchanged.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, but only if `k` is not 0. If `k` is 0, `sm` remains unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`.
