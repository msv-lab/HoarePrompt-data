Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 1, `k` is -2 or -1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to its current value.
- Initially, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`.
- After the code execution, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
