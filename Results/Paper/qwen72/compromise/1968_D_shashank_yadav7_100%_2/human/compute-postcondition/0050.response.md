Postcondition: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the initial input integer minus `n`, `b` is the final value of `p[b] - 1` after `n` iterations, `s` is the final value of `p[s] - 1` after `n` iterations, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.**
