Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined structure, not as direct function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `t` is the number of test cases, an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the initial input integer minus `n`, `b` is the final value of `p[b] - 1` after `n` iterations, `s` is the final value of `p[s] - 1` after `n` iterations, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, and `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop, `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop executes fully if `n` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. In this case, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k - n`, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed `n` times, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed `n` times, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` taken `n` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` taken `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes, `i` is the value at which `k` became 0 plus 1, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are the values at the time `k` became 0, `sp` and `bp` are the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` taken `i` times, and `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` and `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `i-1` respectively. Additionally, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, the current state is that `bm` is greater than `sm`. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the current state is that `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
