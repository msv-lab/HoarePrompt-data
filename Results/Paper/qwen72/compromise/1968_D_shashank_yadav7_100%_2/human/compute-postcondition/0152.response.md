Postcondition: ***The loop executes fully if `n` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. In this case, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k - n`, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed `n` times, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed `n` times, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` taken `n` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` taken `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes, `i` is the value at which `k` became 0 plus 1, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are the values at the time `k` became 0, `sp` and `bp` are the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` taken `i` times, and `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` and `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `i-1` respectively. Additionally, if `bm` is less than `sm`, the current state is that `bm` is less than `sm`. If `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, the current state is that `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.***
