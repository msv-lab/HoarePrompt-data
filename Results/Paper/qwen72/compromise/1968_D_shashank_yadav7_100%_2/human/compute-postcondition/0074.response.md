Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now `k - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged, but the updated value of `k` is used in the calculations for `bm` and `sm`.
- `bm` is calculated as `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, using the new value of `k`.
- `sm` is calculated as `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, using the new value of `k`.
