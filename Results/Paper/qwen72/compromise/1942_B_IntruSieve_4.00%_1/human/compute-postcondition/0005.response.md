To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator, and it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function when the loop starts.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

The other variables and objects mentioned in the state before the loop (such as `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 (which will be set by the `range(n)` function).

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
