### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0, which will help in constructing the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - It checks if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx` and updates `maxx` accordingly to ensure that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, it prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - It ensures that the MEX value is correctly calculated and that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The program also handles the case where `a_i` is negative by correctly adjusting the values to maintain the permutation properties.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
