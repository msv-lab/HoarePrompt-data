### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0, which will help in constructing the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - It checks if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx` and updates `maxx` accordingly to ensure that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - It ensures that the MEX value is correctly calculated and that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The program also handles the case where `a_i` is negative by correctly adjusting the values to maintain the permutation properties.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program:

- **Flaw in Handling Negative Values:**
  - When `a_i` is negative, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is incorrect because the MEX value is `minn`, and the correct value to append should be `minn + arr[i]` to satisfy the equation `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
  - For example, if `a_i = -2` and `minn = 0`, the correct value to append should be `2` (since `0 - 2 = -2`), not `abs(-2 - 0) = 2`.

- **Correct Logic:**
  - If `a_i` is positive, `p_i` should be `minn` and `minn` should be incremented.
  - If `a_i` is negative, `p_i` should be `minn + arr[i]` and `maxx` should be updated to ensure the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling negative values in the array `a`. The correct value to append to `mex` when `a_i` is negative should be `minn + arr[i]` instead of `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

Final: **False**
