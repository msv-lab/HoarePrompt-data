Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it constructs the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The approach taken in the program does not correctly handle the relationship between the MEX of the prefix of `p` and the elements of `a`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by appending elements to `mex` based on the value of `arr[i]`. However, the logic for determining the MEX and the corresponding element in `p` is flawed.
   - Specifically, the line `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` does not correctly reflect the relationship between the MEX and the elements of `p`.

2. **Handling of `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The program uses `minn` and `maxx` to track the current MEX and the maximum value in `p`, but the logic for updating these values is incorrect.
   - For example, when `arr[i]` is positive, the program simply appends `minn` and increments it, which does not account for the correct MEX of the prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Track the current MEX of the prefix of `p`.
- Use the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to determine the value of `p_i`.
- Ensure that the constructed permutation `p` is valid and satisfies the given `a`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] >= 0:
            p_i = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p_i)
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        else:
            p_i = mex
            used.add(p_i)
            mex += 1
        p.append(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Initialization**:
  - `p` is the permutation we are constructing.
  - `mex` is the current MEX of the prefix of `p`.
  - `used` is a set to keep track of the elements already in `p`.

- **Constructing `p`**:
  - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, we determine `p_i` based on the value of `a[i]`.
  - If `a[i]` is non-negative, we calculate `p_i` as `mex - a[i]` and add it to `used`.
  - If `a[i]` is negative, we set `p_i` to the current `mex` and increment `mex` until it is not in `used`.

- **Output**:
  - After constructing `p`, we print the elements of `p` separated by spaces.

This approach ensures that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the given array `a` and the MEX relationship.
