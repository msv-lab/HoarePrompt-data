The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n + 1`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
