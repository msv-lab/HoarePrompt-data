The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `j` is 0**
