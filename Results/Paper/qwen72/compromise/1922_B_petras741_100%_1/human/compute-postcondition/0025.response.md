Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates `n + 1` times, with `j` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each time until it reaches `n`.
- For each iteration, if the value at `q[j]` is greater than 0, the index `j` is appended to the list `eta`.
- After all iterations, `j` will be `n` (one more than the last index of `q`), and `eta` will contain all the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0.
