The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` and `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 2**
