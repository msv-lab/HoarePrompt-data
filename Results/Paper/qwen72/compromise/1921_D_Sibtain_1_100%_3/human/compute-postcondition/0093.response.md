Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers and must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains unchanged as a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged at 0.
- The value of `t1` remains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- `t2` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. This means `t2` is the absolute difference between the `j`-th element from the end of `a` and the `j`-th element from the end of `c`.
