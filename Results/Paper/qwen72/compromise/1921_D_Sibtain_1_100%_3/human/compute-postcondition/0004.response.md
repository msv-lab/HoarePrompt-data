Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `c` is a list of integers read from the new input. The length of the set of `a` is 1, meaning all elements in `a` are the same, and the length of the set of `c` is 1, meaning all elements in `c` are the same. Additionally, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.**
