Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, and `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `j` remains unchanged.***
