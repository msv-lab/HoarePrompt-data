The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that the loop control variables and the state of the program remain unchanged, but the loop will proceed to the next iteration if the loop condition is still met.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `c` is now a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations where `t1` was not greater than `t2`, `j` is the number of iterations where `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1 and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.**
