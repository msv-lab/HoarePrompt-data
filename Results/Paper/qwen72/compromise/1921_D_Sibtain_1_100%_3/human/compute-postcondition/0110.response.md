Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 1.**
