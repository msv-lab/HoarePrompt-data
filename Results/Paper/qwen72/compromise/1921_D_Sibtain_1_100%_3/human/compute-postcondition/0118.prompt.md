You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5), a_i is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b_i is a list of m positive integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        a.sort()
        
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        
        i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
        
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`max(t1, t2)`) for each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations where `t2 <= t1`, `j` is 1 + the number of iterations where `t2 > t1`, and `k` is `len(a) - 1`. The loop has printed the value of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5), a list `a_i` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and a list `b_i` of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
