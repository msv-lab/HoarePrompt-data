The variables in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` are met.

1. **`j < m`**: At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1.
2. **`b[j] != a[i]`**: At the end of the last iteration, `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`. For the loop to execute again, `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.

No other states need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a new input string and `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`**
