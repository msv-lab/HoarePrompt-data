Output State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j]` equals `a[2]` and `j` is less than `m`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
- The initial condition that `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j]` equals `a[2]` and `j` is less than `m` is updated to `j` being the smallest index + 1 such that `b[j]` equals `a[2]` and `j` is still less than `m`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
