Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of the string `b`, and `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
