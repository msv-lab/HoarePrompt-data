You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

            break
        
    #State: `a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, or 0 if no such matches are found before the loop breaks)
    return
    #The program returns the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j] == a[n-1]` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes \( k \) (the length of the prefix that is a subsequence) and \( j \) (the index in string \( b \)).
3. **Iterating Over String \( a \)**: It iterates over each character in string \( a \) using the index \( i \).
4. **Finding Matching Characters in \( b \)**: For each character in \( a \), it uses a while loop to find the next matching character in \( b \) starting from the current position \( j \).
5. **Updating \( k \) and \( j \)**: If a match is found, it increments \( k \) and \( j \) to move to the next character in \( b \).
6. **Breaking the Loop**: If no match is found (i.e., \( j \) reaches the end of \( b \)), it breaks out of the loop.
7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of \( k \) for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including:
- When \( a \) or \( b \) are empty.
- When \( a \) is longer than \( b \).
- When \( a \) and \( b \) contain only '0' or '1'.
- When \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \) but not a prefix.
- When \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \).

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
