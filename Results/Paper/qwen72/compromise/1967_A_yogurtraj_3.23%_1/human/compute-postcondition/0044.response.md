To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop completes.
- `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes.
- `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes.
- If `k` is not 0, `r` is set to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- If `k` is 0, `r` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ii in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over a range determined by the user input.
- The variable `ii` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `ii` is less than the user input.

### Adjusting the States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ii`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The user input (which determines the range) must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop completes, `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes, `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes, the user input must be greater than 1.**
