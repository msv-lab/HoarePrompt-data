Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + (0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `rem` is `(0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) % 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
