Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `r` is now `a[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
