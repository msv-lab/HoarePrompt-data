Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = 0` sets the variable `y` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same as in the initial state.
