Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- Therefore, `r` becomes `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
