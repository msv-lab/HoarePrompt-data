Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `k` is now \( k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2]) \), and `r` is `a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to `a[3]` because `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
