The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `ii` is 0

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The values of `t` and `ii` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
