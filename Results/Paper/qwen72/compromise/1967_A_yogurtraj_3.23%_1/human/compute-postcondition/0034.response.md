Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `r` is either `a[1]` or `a[2]`, `y` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `rem` is 0, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value.
- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]` and `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- Therefore, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` evaluates to `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- The new value of `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
