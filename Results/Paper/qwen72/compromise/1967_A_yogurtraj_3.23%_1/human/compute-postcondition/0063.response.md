Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `a[1] + k // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `y`, `rem`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
