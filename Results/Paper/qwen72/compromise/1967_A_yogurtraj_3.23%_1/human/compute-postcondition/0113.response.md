Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, and `r` is equal to `a[2]`.***
