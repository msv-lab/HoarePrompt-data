Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + (-2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `y` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `rem` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) % 3`, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`.
- Given `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])` and `i` is 2, the expression becomes `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) % 3`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
