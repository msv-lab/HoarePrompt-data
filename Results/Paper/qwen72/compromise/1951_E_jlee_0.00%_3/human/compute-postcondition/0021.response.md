Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `done` remains False. If `n` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. If `n` is greater than 1 and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Additionally, `x` is not the only character in `s` (i.e., `s` contains at least one character that is not `x`). The current value of `s.count(x)` is `n - 1`.**
