Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count2` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False.
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The current value of `count2` is greater than `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is a simple string literal and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The string 'YES' will be printed regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count2`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
