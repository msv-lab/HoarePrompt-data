The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `done` is False, `count` is the index of the first character in the new `s` that is not equal to `x` if such a character exists, otherwise it is 0, `count2` is the number of times a character in the new `s` that is not the first character and not equal to `x` was encountered, but only if `count` is a positive integer. If `n` == 1, the variables retain their initial values. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the variables retain their values as described above. If `x` is equal to the last character of `s`, the variables also retain their initial values.**
