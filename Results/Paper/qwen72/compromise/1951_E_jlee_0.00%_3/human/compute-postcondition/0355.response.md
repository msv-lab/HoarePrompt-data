Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0 or greater than or equal to `count`, and `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`). Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` > 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
