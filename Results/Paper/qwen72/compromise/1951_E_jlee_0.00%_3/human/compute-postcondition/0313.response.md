Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0 or greater than 0, `done` is False. If `s.count(x) == n`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. If `n` == 1 or `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, or if `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.***
