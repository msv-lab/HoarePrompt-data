Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count`, and `done` is True if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` and `count` > 1, or `done` remains False if `count2` is 0 or `count` is less than or equal to 1.***
