Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains False. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than 0, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `count` and `done` retain their original values.***
