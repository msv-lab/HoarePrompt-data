Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `done` is False, `count` is the index of the first character in the new `s` that is not equal to `x` if such a character exists, otherwise it is 0, `count2` is the number of times a character in the new `s` that is not the first character and not equal to `x` was encountered, but only if `count` is a positive integer. If `n` == 1, the variables retain their initial values. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the variables retain their values as described above. If `x` is equal to the last character of `s`, the variables also retain their initial values. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, and if `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the variables retain their values as described above. Otherwise, if `n` is even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, the variables also retain their initial values.***
