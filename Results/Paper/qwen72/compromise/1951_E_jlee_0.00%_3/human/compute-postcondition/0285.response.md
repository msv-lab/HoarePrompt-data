Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` is False. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` is greater than 1, `count` remains unchanged, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is not equal to `count`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` is True. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` is True. If `count` is less than or equal to 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged.***
