To determine what will be printed by the `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is 0 or 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`).
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will output two substrings: `string[:j]` and `string[j:]`.
   - `string[:j]` is the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j`.
   - `string[j:]` is the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `string` is the input string.
   - `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the second character to the end of `string`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
