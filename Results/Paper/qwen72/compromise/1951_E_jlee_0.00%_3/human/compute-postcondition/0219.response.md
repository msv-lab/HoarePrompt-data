Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0 or greater than 0, and `done` is either True or False. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count`, and `done` is True if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` and `count` > 1, or `done` remains False if `count2` is 0 or `count` is less than or equal to 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1 and `done` remains False. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is True and `count` is set to 0. Otherwise, `done` remains False, and `count` remains 0.***
