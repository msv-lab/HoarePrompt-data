The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The list `s` contains strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and the length of each string is between 1 and 1,000,000 characters. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` across all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1,000,000) and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
