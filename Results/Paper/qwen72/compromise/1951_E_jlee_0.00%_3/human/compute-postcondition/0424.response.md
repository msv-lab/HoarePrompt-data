Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 0 or 1, `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented to 2 and `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
