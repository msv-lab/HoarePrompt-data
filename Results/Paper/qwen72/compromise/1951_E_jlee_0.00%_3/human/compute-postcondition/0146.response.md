Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. `done` is False, indicating that none of the conditions for `done` being True were met during the loop execution. `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` if such a character exists, otherwise it is 0. `count2` is the number of times a character in `s` that is not the first character and not equal to `x` was encountered, but only if `count` is a positive integer.**
