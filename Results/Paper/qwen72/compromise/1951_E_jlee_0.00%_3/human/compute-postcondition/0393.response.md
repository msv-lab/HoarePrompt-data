Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is 0, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.***
