Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `done`.
