You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string and determines if it can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are not the same. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the substrings. If not, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the program state is undefined as the function does not modify any global variables or return any values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters for easier manipulation.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has only one character, it correctly prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the string itself is not a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly prints "NO" because any substring of such a string will also be a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters except one are the same, the program checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, it prints "NO" because the middle character will always form a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the string to find the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If it finds such a pair, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   - If it does not find such a pair, it continues to check for the possibility of partitioning the string into two non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses two counters `count` and `count2` to track the positions of characters that are different from the first character.
   - If it finds a valid partition, it prints "YES" with the partition details.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the General Case:
- The program's logic for the general case is complex and may not cover all edge cases effectively.
- Specifically, the use of `count` and `count2` to track positions and the conditions for printing the partition may not always result in a correct partition.
- For example, if the string is "abccba", the program will not correctly identify that this string can be partitioned into "abc" and "cba" as non-palindromic substrings.

### Simplified Approach:
- A simpler and more effective approach would be to check if the string can be partitioned into at least two non-palindromic substrings.
- If the string is not a palindrome, it can always be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings by splitting it at any position where the characters are different.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is overly complex and may not handle all cases correctly. A simpler approach would be more reliable.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not always correctly identify valid partitions for non-palindromic substrings, especially in the general case.
