The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return a value; instead, it raises a `TypeError` because `dx` and `dy` are not assigned any values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99. It raises a `TypeError` because `dx` and `dy` are not assigned any values.**
