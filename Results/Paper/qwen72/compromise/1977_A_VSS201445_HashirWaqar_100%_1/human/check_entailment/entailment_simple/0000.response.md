### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - `n` must be at least `m` to have a chance of building a tower of height `m` after `n` moves.
     - The difference `(n - m)` being even ensures that the number of moves to add and remove cubes can balance out to achieve exactly `m` cubes. If the difference is odd, it means that the number of moves to add and remove cubes cannot balance out, and thus it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" are acceptable.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `m` are both 1.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is much larger than `m` and vice versa.

5. **State After Loop**:
   - The program correctly iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each one.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are re-assigned in each iteration, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
