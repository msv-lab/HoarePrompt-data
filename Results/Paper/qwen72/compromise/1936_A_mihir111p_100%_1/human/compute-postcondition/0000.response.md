Based on the precondition, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers that are less than the length of the permutation `p`. The `print` statement will output a string that includes these variables in the specified format.

Let's break down the print statement:
- The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are variables whose values are non-negative integers and are less than `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of the given precondition.

Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)**
