To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`, which is `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`.
   - This condition will be true if `n > 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr[i]` is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `arr[i + 1]` is the second element of the list `arr`.
   - For the loop to execute, the first element must be equal to the second element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that `i < len(arr) - 1` is true.
- **`arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**: This ensures that `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
