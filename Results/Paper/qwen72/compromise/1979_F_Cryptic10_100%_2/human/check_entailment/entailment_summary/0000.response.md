### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices from 1 to `n` and an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.

2. **Querying and Removing Vertices:**
   - For each test case, the function enters a loop that continues until there are only 2 vertices left in `vx`.
   - It queries the interactor with `? (len(vx) - 2)` to find a vertex `v1` with a degree at least `len(vx) - 2` and another vertex `v2` that is not connected to `v1`.
   - The vertex `v1` is removed from the set `vx`.
   - If `v2` is greater than 0, it means `v1` is connected to `v2`, and the pair `(v1, v2)` is added to the list `ops`.
   - If `v2` is 0, it means `v1` is not connected to any other vertex, and the function makes another query with `? 0` to find a vertex `v3` with the minimum degree and another vertex that is not connected to `v3`. The pairs `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`.

3. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path:**
   - Once the set `vx` contains only 2 vertices, these vertices are stored in the list `p1`.
   - The function then processes the `ops` list in reverse order to construct the Hamiltonian path.
   - For each operation `(v1, v2)`, it appends `v1` to `p2` if the last vertex in `p1` is `v2`, otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path by concatenating `p1` and `p2` in reverse order.

4. **Output and Buffer Flushing:**
   - The function ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each query and answer to avoid the "Idleness limit exceeded" error.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified.
- It uses the correct number of queries and processes the responses appropriately.
- The logic for constructing the Hamiltonian path is sound, as it ensures that the path passes through each vertex exactly once and respects the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
