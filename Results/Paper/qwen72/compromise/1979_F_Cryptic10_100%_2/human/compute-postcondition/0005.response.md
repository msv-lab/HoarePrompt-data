Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `v1` is removed from `vx`.
- The length of `vx` is now `int(input()) - 1`.
- `ops` remains an empty list.
- `v1` and `v2` are still the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, which is `q(int(input()) - 2)`.
- The initial condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
