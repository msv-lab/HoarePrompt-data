To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` from the `ops` list. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so for the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`.
2. `ops[::-1]` is the reversed version of the `ops` list.
3. For the loop to execute, `ops` must have at least one tuple.
4. The state of `p1`, `p2`, and `vx` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
5. Before the loop starts, `v1` and `v2` should be set to the values of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, which is the last tuple in the original `ops` list.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the last tuple in `ops`**
