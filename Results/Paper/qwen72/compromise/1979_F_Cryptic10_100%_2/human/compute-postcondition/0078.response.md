The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. The loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` is greater than the number of iterations that have already been completed. At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, indicating that at least one iteration has already been completed. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than the number of iterations that have been completed, which is now 2.

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 2**
