Postcondition: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
