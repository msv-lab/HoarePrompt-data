Output State: **`vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations. `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, plus any integers from `ops` that were appended to `p1` because `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing any integers from `ops` that were appended to `p2` because `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the time of the operation.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The set `vx` remains unchanged and still contains the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations.
- The list `ops` remains unchanged and still contains all the tuples representing the operations performed during the loop.
- The list `p1` starts with the two integers from `vx` and may have additional integers appended to it from the `ops` list, specifically those where the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation was not equal to `v2`.
- The list `p2` starts empty and may have integers appended to it from the `ops` list, specifically those where the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation was equal to `v2`.
