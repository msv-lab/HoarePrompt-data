Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2` or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the last tuple in `ops`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` or `p2` remains an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`. If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` now contains `v1`. If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` now contains an additional element `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` or `p1` now contains an additional element `v1` if `p1[-1] != v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the third-to-last tuple in `ops`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
