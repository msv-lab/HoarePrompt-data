The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`, so the next iteration will use the second-to-last tuple in `ops` (if it exists). For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least two tuples.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2` or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`.
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values of the last tuple in `ops`.

For the next iteration:
- `ops` must contain at least two tuples.
- `v1` and `v2` will be the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2` or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`**
