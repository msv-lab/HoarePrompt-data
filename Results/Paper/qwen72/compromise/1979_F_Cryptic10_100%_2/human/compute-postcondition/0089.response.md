Postcondition: ***`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`. `v2` is either greater than 0 or 0.***
