Output State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` or `p1` now contains an additional element `v1` if `p1[-1] != v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the third-to-last tuple in `ops`.**
