Output State: **`vx` is a set containing more than 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**

Explanation:
- `vx` remains a set containing more than 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` remains an empty list.
- `p1` remains a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` remains a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.
- `v1` and `v2` are now assigned the values returned by the function `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The specific values of `v1` and `v2` depend on the function `q` and the length of `vx` minus 2.
