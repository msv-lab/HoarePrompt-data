### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the function summary to understand the program's behavior and correctness.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the user input.
- It calculates the product of all integers in `vals` and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- It also calculates `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`.
- If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns.
- Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns without any value.

#### Original Assessment:
- The program is marked as **False** because it does not handle the case where the multipliers are all the same and equal to 2.
- For example, if the input is:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 2 2
  ```
  The program will calculate the product as 8, and the bets as [4, 4, 4]. The sum of the bets is 12, and the denominator becomes 8 - 12 = -4, which is less than or equal to 0. The program will then print -1, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists (e.g., [1, 1, 1]).

#### Analysis:
1. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product `prod` of all elements in `vals` is calculated.
   - For the example input `2 2 2`, the product `prod` is \(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\).

2. **Bets Calculation**:
   - The list `vprod` is calculated as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - For the example input `2 2 2`, `vprod` is `[8 // 2, 8 // 2, 8 // 2] = [4, 4, 4]`.

3. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - For the example input `2 2 2`, `sum(vprod)` is \(4 + 4 + 4 = 12\).
   - Therefore, `den` is \(8 - 12 = -4\).

4. **Output**:
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns.
   - For the example input `2 2 2`, `den` is -4, so the function prints `-1`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying a specific case where the program fails.
- When all multipliers are the same and equal to 2, the sum of the bets will always be greater than the product, leading to a negative or zero denominator.
- This results in the function printing `-1`, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists (e.g., [1, 1, 1]).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same and equal to 2, leading to an incorrect output of `-1` when a valid solution exists.
