### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values (`prod`).
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding `k_i`.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `prod` to get `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product of all `k_i` values is calculated correctly.
   - **vprod Calculation:** Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `prod // k_i`, which is correct.
   - **den Calculation:** The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `prod` to get `den`. This is the total amount of coins bet minus the total amount of coins received back if any single outcome wins.
   - **Condition Check:** The condition `den <= 0` is used to determine if a valid distribution is possible. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is correct.
   - **Output:** If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the elements of `vprod`, which are the bets on each outcome. This is a valid solution because the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.
   - The program also handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are respected: `1 \le t \le 10^4`, `1 \le n \le 50`, and `2 \le k_i \le 20`.
   - The bets `x_i` are within the range `1 \le x_i \le 10^9` as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets on each outcome and handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
