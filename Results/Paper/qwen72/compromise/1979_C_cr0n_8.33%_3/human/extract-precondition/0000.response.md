It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. Here's the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def distribute_coins(t, n, k):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**
