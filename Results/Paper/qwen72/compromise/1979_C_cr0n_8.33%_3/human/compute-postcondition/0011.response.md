Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
- `N` is an input integer.
- `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- `den` is the result of `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
- `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Product Calculation (`prod`)**:
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, then `prod = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

2. **List `vprod` Calculation**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - Continuing with the example `vals = [2, 3, 4]`:
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 24 / 2 = 12`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 24 / 3 = 8`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 24 / 4 = 6`
   - So, `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`.

3. **Denominator Calculation (`den`)**:
   - `den` is the result of `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - Continuing with the example:
     - `sum(vprod) = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 24 - 26 = -2`
   - However, the precondition states that `den` is greater than 0. This implies that the values in `vals` and `prod` are chosen such that `den` is positive.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
   - For the example `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`, the output will be:
     - `' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]) = '12 8 6'`

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of the list `vprod` as a space-separated string. Each element in `vprod` is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Output: **vprod (where vprod is a list of integers, each element being the result of prod divided by the corresponding element in vals, and prod is the product of all integers in the list vals)**

For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, the output will be:
Output: **12 8 6**
