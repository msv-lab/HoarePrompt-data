The code snippet `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.**
