Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. For each subsequent element `a[i]`, the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

2. **Construction of `a[i]`**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` by at least `x[i-1]`, which means `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be equal to `x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The values of `a[i]` are within the allowed range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` because `a[0]` is 500 and each subsequent `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`, where `1 <= x_i <= 500`. The maximum value of `a[i]` will be `500 + (n-1) * 500`, which is well within the limit of `10^9` for the given constraints.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `n = 4` and `x = [2, 4, 1]`:
     - `a[0] = 500`
     - `a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502`
     - `a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506`
     - `a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507`
     - Output: `500 502 506 507`
     - Verification:
       - `502 % 500 = 2` (matches `x[1]`)
       - `506 % 502 = 4` (matches `x[2]`)
       - `507 % 506 = 1` (matches `x[3]`)

   - For the second test case with `n = 3` and `x = [1, 1]`:
     - `a[0] = 500`
     - `a[1] = 500 + 1 = 501`
     - `a[2] = 501 + 1 = 502`
     - Output: `500 501 502`
     - Verification:
       - `501 % 500 = 1` (matches `x[1]`)
       - `502 % 501 = 1` (matches `x[2]`)

The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the conditions are satisfied for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
