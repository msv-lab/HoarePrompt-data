The value of `count` is incremented by the value found in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, or by 0 if the key does not exist in `residue_map`. Since `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, the key `(r_x, r_y)` does not exist, and `count` is incremented by 0, so `count` remains 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**
