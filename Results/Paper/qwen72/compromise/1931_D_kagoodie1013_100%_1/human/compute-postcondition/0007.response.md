The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary, or by 0 if the key does not exist. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**
