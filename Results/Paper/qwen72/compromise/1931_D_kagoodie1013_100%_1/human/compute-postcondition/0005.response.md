Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- `r_x` is assigned the value of `-num % x`. Since `num` is the first element of `arr` and `x` is a part of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` will be the result of the modulo operation `-num % x`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
