The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If there is another tuple in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again with the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `test_cases` must be the second tuple. Therefore, `(n, x, y, arr)` will be updated to the second tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is undefined for the next iteration, `residue_map` is undefined for the next iteration, `arr` is the array part of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `num` is undefined for the next iteration, `r_x` is undefined for the next iteration, `r_y` is undefined for the next iteration, `current_key` is undefined for the next iteration**
