Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 3, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 2, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary. If the key is not found, the default value is 0.
- The key `(r_x, r_y)` is the same as `current_key`, which is `(num % x, num % y)`.
- The `residue_map` dictionary has the key `(num % x, num % y)` with a value of 2.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by 2, making `count` 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
