Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element.**

Explanation:
- The `residue_map` dictionary is reinitialized to an empty dictionary.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, `count`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only affects the `residue_map` dictionary.
