Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`, and the `residue_map` dictionary is reset to an empty dictionary after each tuple is processed.**

Explanation:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- The `results` list contains the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` corresponds to the total number of pairs in the respective `arr` that have the same residues `(num % x, num % y)` as any previous elements in the same `arr`.
- The `residue_map` dictionary is used to keep track of the counts of residue pairs `(num % x, num % y)` for each iteration of the inner loop. After processing each tuple, `residue_map` is reset to an empty dictionary, so it does not retain information from one tuple to the next.
- The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated for each tuple in `test_cases` but are not retained after the loop for the next tuple.
- The variables `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are updated within the inner loop for each element in `arr` but are not retained after the inner loop completes for the current tuple.
