Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 2, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

The code snippet `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The `current_key` tuple, which was previously defined as `(num % x, num % y)`, still holds the same values, and the `residue_map` dictionary still contains the key `(num % x, num % y)` with the value 2. The `test_cases` list and `results` list also remain unchanged.
