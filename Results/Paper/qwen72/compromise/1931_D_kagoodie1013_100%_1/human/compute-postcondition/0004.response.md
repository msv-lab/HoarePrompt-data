The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `arr` is part of the first tuple in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one tuple. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
