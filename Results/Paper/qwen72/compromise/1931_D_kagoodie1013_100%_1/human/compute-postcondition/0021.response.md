Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value 3, `arr` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `residue_map[current_key]` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `residue_map` had the key `current_key` with the value 2.
- After the code execution, `residue_map[current_key]` is now 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
