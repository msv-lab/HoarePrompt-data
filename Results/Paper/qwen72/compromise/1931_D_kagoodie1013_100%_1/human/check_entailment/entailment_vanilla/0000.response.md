Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by storing them in a list `test_cases` and processing each one in the `func_1` function.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - These residues are used as keys in a dictionary `residue_map` to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with specific residues.
   - For each element `num`, it checks if there is already a pair in the dictionary that satisfies the conditions by looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one per line, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `n` is small or large, and when `x` and `y` are large.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store and look up residues, which provides an efficient way to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
