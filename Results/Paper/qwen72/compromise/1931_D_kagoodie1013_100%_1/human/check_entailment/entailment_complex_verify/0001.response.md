Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by storing them in a list `test_cases` and processing each one in the `func_1` function.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue here. The residue `r_x` should be calculated as `num % x` rather than `-num % x` to correctly check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. The current implementation of `r_x` will not always give the correct residue for the sum condition.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with specific residues.
   - For each element `num`, it checks if there is already a pair in the dictionary that satisfies the conditions by looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.
   - The current implementation of `r_x` as `-num % x` means that the program might miss valid pairs or count invalid pairs, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one per line, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `n` is small or large, and when `x` and `y` are large.
   - However, due to the incorrect calculation of `r_x`, the program may fail to handle some edge cases correctly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store and look up residues, which provides an efficient way to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.
   - The overall time complexity is O(t * n), which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `r_x`. The correct implementation should use `num % x` for `r_x` to ensure that the sum condition is checked correctly.

Final: **False**
