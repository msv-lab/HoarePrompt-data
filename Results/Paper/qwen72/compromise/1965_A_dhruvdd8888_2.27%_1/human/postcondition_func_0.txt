The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` unique integers. It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the following conditions: if the list contains only one unique integer, it prints 'Alice'; if the list contains exactly two unique integers, it prints 'Bob'; if the list contains more than two unique integers, it checks for the number of consecutive integers starting from the smallest (excluding the 0 inserted at the beginning). If the count of consecutive integers is odd, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function always returns `None`. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `piles` remain unchanged.
