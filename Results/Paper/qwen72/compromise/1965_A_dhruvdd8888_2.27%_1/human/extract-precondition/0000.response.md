It seems there was a mistake in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases, the number of piles, and the list of piles as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(t, n, piles):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and piles is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
