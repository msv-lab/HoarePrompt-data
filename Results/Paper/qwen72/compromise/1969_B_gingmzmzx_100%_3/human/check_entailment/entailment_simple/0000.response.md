### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. This is appropriate because the string consists only of '0's and '1's.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` using `zeroes = s.count(0)`. This is a valid and efficient way to count the number of zeroes.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s` and updates the counts in `cnt`.
   - For each '0' encountered, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - For each '1' encountered, it adds the number of remaining '0's that need to be moved to the left of the current '1' (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of the costs of all operations needed to sort the string.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string by considering the number of '1's that need to be moved to the left of each '0' and vice versa.
   - The cost calculation is based on the idea that each '1' that is to the left of a '0' in the final sorted string will require a cyclic shift operation, and the cost is the length of the substring being shifted.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") correctly by outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's and requires multiple operations to sort correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The input and output handling, as well as the cost calculation, are all consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
