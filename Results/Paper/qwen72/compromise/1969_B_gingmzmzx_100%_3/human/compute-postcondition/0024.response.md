To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a list of integers derived from an input string.
   - `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
   - `ans` is the total number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated based on the number of zeros and ones in the list `s`.
   - For each zero in `s`, we can pair it with any one that comes after it in the list.
   - The number of such pairs is given by the product of the number of zeros and the number of ones that come after each zero.

3. **Formula for `ans`:**
   - If `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, then the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j` is simply `cnt[0] * cnt[1]`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `ans` is the product of the number of zeros and the number of ones in the list `s`.

Therefore, the `print(ans)` statement will print the total number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`.

Output: **cnt[0] * cnt[1] (where cnt[0] is the number of zeros in the list `s` and cnt[1] is the number of ones in the list `s`)**
