Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least two elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes` + 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], so `cnt[1]` is 0, and `ans` remains 0.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 2], so `cnt[1]` is 2, and `ans` is incremented by 1, making it `zeroes` + 1.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `c` remain unchanged.
