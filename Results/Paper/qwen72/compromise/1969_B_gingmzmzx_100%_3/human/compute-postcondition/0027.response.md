Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the new `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in the new `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in the new `s`, `ans` is the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`**

Explanation:
- The value of `zeroes` is updated to the number of zeros in the list `s` using `s.count(0)`.
- The initial state specifies that `cnt[0]` is already the number of zeros in `s`, so `zeroes` is now equal to `cnt[0]`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
