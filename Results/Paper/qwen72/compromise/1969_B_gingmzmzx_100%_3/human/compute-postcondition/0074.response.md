The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a binary string `s`. The function accepts a binary string `s` as input, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 2 路 10^5, and `s` consists only of '0's and '1's. The function also handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of the lengths of all strings across these test cases not exceeding 2 路 10^5. The output of the function is not explicitly provided, but based on the context, it is expected to return some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input string `s`. The length of `s` is between 2 and 2 路 10^5, and `s` consists only of '0's and '1's. The function can handle up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of the lengths of all strings not exceeding 2 路 10^5.**
