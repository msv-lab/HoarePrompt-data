Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from a new input string with at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if `c` is 1, and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `c` is 1, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0 but not 1.***
