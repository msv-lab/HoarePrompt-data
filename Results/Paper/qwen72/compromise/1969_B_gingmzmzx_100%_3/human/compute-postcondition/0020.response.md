The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `c`, and `cnt[c]`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least 3 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
