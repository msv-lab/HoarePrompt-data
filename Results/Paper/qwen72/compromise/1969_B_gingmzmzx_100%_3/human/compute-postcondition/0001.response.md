The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other details about the function's input and constraints do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
