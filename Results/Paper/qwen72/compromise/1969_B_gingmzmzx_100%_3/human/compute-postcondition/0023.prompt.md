Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, and `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` (the second integer in `s`) is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is set to `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least 3 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is increased by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
