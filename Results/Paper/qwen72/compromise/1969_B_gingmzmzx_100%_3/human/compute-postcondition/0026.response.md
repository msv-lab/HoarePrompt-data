Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the new `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in the new `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in the new `s`, `ans` is the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`**

Explanation:
- The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` updates the list `s` with a new list of integers derived from the input string.
- Since `s` is updated, the number of zeros in `s` (`zeroes`) and the count of zeros and ones in `cnt` also need to be recalculated based on the new `s`.
- The variable `ans` is still the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`, but it will be based on the new `s`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1, as it is not affected by the code.
