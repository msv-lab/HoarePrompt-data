Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from a new input string with at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])`. If `c` is not 0 and not 1, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])`.***
