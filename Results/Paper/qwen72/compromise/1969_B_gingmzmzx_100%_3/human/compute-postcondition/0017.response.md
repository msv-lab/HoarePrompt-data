Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, and `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` (the second integer in `s`) is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is set to `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
