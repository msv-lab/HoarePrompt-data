Precondition: **The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0's and '1's. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the binary string and the number of test cases as parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of binary strings, where each string s in test_cases satisfies 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
