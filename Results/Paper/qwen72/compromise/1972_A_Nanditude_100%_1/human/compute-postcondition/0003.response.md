Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `a`. Therefore, after executing this code, `a` is a list of integers, while the other variables remain unchanged.
