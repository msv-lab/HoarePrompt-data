Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 2. If `b[0]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3 and `i` is 0. If `b[0]` is not less than `a[i]` and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 1. If `b[0]` is not less than `a[i]` and `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2. If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 or 1 or 0, and `i` is 1 or 2 or 3.***
