Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), s is a string of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0.**

The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `l` is now assigned the value 0.
