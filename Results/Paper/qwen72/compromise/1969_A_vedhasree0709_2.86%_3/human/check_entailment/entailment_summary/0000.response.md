Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks for a very specific pattern in the list `l` (i.e., `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`). This pattern is not a general solution to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Specific Pattern Check**: The program checks if there exists a pair of friends where the first friend's best friend is the next friend in the list, and the next friend's best friend is the first friend. This is a very specific case and does not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
2. **General Solution Missing**: The problem requires a more general approach to find the minimum number of invitations. The program should consider all possible pairs of friends and their best friends to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
3. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The program will output `3` for many cases where the correct answer should be `2`. For example, in the second test case of the provided example, the correct answer is `3`, but the program will not correctly identify this because it is looking for a specific pattern that does not exist in the input.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify all pairs of friends where both friends are each other's best friends.
- If such a pair exists, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2`.
- If no such pair exists, you need to find a set of friends such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This can be done by identifying a cycle or a chain of friends where the minimum number of invitations can be sent to ensure at least 2 friends come.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l = [x - 1 for x in l]  # Convert to 0-based index for easier manipulation
        
        # Find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i]] == i:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            # If no such pair exists, the minimum number of invitations is 3
            print(3)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Convert to 0-based index**: This makes it easier to work with the list indices.
- **Check for pairs**: The program checks if there exists any friend `i` such that the best friend of `i`'s best friend is `i` itself. If such a pair is found, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2`.
- **Default to 3**: If no such pair is found, the program prints `3` because it is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party (by forming a chain or cycle of at least 3 friends).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks for a specific pattern and does not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
