You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. The function checks if there exists any index `k` in the list `l` such that `l[k] == k + 2` and `l[k + 1] == k + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` for that test case. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function has printed either `2` or `3` for each test case, depending on the conditions met within the list `l`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates over the list `l` from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.
     - If this condition is met, it prints 2, sets `j` to 1, and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `j` to 1, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` checks if the best friend of the friend at index `i` is the friend at index `i + 1` and vice versa. This is a specific case where two friends are each other's best friends and are adjacent in the list.
   - If this condition is met, the program correctly prints 2 because sending invitations to these two friends will ensure they both come to the party.
   - However, this condition is too specific and does not cover all possible cases where at least 2 friends can come to the party. For example, if the best friends are not adjacent in the list, the program will not detect them and will print 3, which may not be the minimum number of invitations required.

4. **Identifying the Flaw**:
   - The program only checks for a specific pattern of best friends being adjacent in the list. This is not a general solution to the problem.
   - The program does not consider other possible configurations of best friends, such as cycles or pairs that are not adjacent.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve identifying all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensuring that at least one pair is invited.
   - If no such pairs exist, the program should consider the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, which could be more complex than just checking adjacent pairs.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases and only checks for a specific pattern.

Correctness: **False**
