The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0

Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, which it already is according to the given state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0**
