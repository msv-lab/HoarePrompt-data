Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1.
- `i` is the second element in the list `palka`.
- `d` is a dictionary that already contains `i` as a key, so `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged.
- The value of `shapes` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains the same.
