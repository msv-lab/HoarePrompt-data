Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the integer `i` if `i` was not in `pl` initially, and `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and the value 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. Since the initial state specifies that `d.get(i) == None` initially, this means that `i` was not in `d` before, and now it is added with the value 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
