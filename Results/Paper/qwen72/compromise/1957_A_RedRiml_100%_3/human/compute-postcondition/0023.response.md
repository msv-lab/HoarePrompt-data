Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i` appended to it, and `d` has the key `i` with the value 1 if `d.get(i) == None` initially, or the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially.**
