Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. `shapes` is 0. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.**
