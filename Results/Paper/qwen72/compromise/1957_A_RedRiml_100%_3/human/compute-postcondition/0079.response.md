Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will contain the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique integer in the list `palka`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
