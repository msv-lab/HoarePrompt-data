Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is an empty dictionary, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `palka`) is either set to 1 if it was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if it was already in `d`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka` if `i` was not previously in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged. `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, and `i` is the first element of `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element of `palka`) is either set to 1 if it was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if it was already in `d`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka` and, if `i` was not previously in `pl`, now also contains the value `i` (the second element of `palka`). `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element of `palka`) is either set to 1 if it was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if it was already in `d`. `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka` and, if `i` was not previously in `pl`, now also contains the value `i` (the third element of `palka`). `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
