Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `pl`, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `shapes` is updated by adding the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, `pl`, `j`) retain their initial values and conditions.
