You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():

    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())

            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `w` iterations, and for each iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the construction of polygons with more than 3 sides. The program assumes that any stick length that appears 3 or more times can form a triangle, and it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. However, the problem description requires the construction of regular polygons, which can have more than 3 sides.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can form two equilateral triangles (each with 3 sides of length 2). However, the program will output `2` because it only checks for the possibility of forming triangles and does not consider other polygons like squares or hexagons.

Another example:
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can form a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4. However, the program will output `3` because it only counts the number of triangles that can be formed, which is incorrect.

The program should be modified to consider the possibility of forming polygons with any number of sides, not just triangles.
