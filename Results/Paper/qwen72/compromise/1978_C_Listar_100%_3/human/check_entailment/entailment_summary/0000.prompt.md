Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:

        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer up to 1,000,000,000,000. It returns a list `l` which is initially a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function modifies `l` and `k` through a series of operations, and the final state of `l` depends on the value of `k` and the number of iterations. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, the function calls `func_2` and returns its result. Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` using `func_3` and decrements `k` until the loop completes. The final value of `c` is `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `k` is the remaining value after all updates.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`, where `c` and `k` are non-negative integers, and `l` is a list of integers. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, which remains the same length and contains the same integers, but the values at the specified indices have been swapped.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list `l` of distinct integers of length `n` (where `n` is at least twice `c`). It swaps the (c-1)-th element and the c-th last element of the list `l` and returns the modified list. After the function call, the (c-1)-th element of `l` is the value that was originally at the c-th last position, and the c-th last element of `l` is the value that was originally at the (c-1)-th position.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is even, it calculates `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even. If `max_k` is less than `k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the input values `n` and `k`. In the final state, if the function does not return `(0, 0)`, `n` and `k` are returned unchanged, with `n` being an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` being an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of unique integers within the range [1, n], where n is the length of the list. It prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list in the same order, separated by spaces, and then a blank line. The function returns `None`, and the list `l` remains unchanged.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`.
