The function `func_4` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is even, it calculates `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even. If `max_k` is less than `k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the input values `n` and `k`. In the final state, if the function does not return `(0, 0)`, `n` and `k` are returned unchanged, with `n` being an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` being an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
