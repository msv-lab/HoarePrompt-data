Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the provided code snippet, the `return` statement is used without specifying any value or variable to return. Therefore, the program does not return any specific value or variable. It simply ends the function execution, and since `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, and the current value of `n` is 0, the return statement does not affect these variables.
