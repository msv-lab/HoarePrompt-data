Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The return statement in the provided code snippet does not specify any variable or value to return. Therefore, the program ends without returning any specific value or variable. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated based on the functions `func_4()` and `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` is called, but none of these values are returned by the final return statement.
