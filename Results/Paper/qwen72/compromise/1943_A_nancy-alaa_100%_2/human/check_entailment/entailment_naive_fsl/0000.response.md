Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains all elements from `0` to `n-1` exactly once, and `n` is even. In such a case, the optimal strategy for both players would result in the final array `c` containing all elements from `0` to `n-1` except for the middle element, which would be the MEX. However, the program incorrectly prints the middle element as the MEX.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
The optimal game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice picks `1` (or `2`), `a = [0, 2, 3]` (or `a = [0, 1, 3]`), `c = [1]` (or `c = [2]`).
2. Bob picks `0`, `a = [2, 3]` (or `a = [1, 3]`), `c = [1, 0]` (or `c = [2, 0]`).
3. Alice picks `2` (or `1`), `a = [3]`, `c = [1, 0, 2]` (or `c = [2, 0, 1]`).
4. Bob picks `3`, `a = []`, `c = [1, 0, 2]` (or `c = [2, 0, 1]`).

The MEX of `c` is `3` (or `3`), but the program will print `1` because it incorrectly assumes that the first missing element with a count of 1 is the MEX. This is a clear violation of the problem description, hence the program is incorrect.
