The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `a` and the number of elements `n`. The array `a` should be a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and `n` is a positive integer. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
