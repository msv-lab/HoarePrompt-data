Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The variable `i` is the smallest integer not in `mpp` keys or the smallest integer in `mpp` keys with a count of 1 where `first` is True. The variable `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The loop has run for each of the `t` test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided as input for each test case.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
- The variable `i` is the smallest integer that is either not present in `arr` or is the first unique integer in `arr` that was found after setting `first` to True.
- The variable `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`. If no such integer is found, `first` remains False.
