Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is False, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
