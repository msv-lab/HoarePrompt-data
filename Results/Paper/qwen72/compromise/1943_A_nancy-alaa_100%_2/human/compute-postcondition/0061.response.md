Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, or if `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, or if `first` is False, the program continues without any changes. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
