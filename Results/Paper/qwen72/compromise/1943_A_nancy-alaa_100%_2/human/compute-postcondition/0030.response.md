Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` is False.
- If `i` (which is 2) is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The condition `if i not in mpp.keys()` is checked. If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. However, since the state remains unchanged if `i` is in `mpp.keys()`, we can infer that the condition is not met (i.e., `i` is in `mpp.keys()`).
- Therefore, the state remains unchanged, and `i` is still 2.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `i`, which is 2.
Output: **2**
