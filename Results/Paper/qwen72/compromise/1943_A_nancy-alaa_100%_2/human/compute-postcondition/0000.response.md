The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop**
