The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 1**
