Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**

The values of `i` and `n` remain the same, and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still in effect. No other variables are affected by the `break` statement.
