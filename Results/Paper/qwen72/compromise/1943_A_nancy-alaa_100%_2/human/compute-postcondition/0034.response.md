Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
