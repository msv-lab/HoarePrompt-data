Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key, `cur` is 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `cur`.
- The previous value of `cur` (which was greater than 1) is no longer valid.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `i`) remain unchanged.
