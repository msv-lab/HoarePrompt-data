Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is 0, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
