Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any), and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N` up to the point where `num` > `cur + 1` or the end of the list is reached, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any). If the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, and if `M[0]` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is 0, `i` is 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is 1, `i` is 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
