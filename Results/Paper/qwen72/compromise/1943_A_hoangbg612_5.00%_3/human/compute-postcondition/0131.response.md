Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is the second element in `N` if `num` > `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 2.** 

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. If `num` was greater than `cur` + 1, `cur` is now the second element in `N` + 1. Otherwise, `cur` was incremented by 1 previously, and is now incremented by another 1, making it the second element in `N` + 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
