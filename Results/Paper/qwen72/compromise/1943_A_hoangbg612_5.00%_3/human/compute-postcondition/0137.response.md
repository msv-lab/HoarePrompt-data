Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
