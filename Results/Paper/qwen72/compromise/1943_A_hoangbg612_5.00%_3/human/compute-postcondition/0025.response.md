Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, if `num` > -1, `cur` remains the first element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value incremented by 1. If `num` <= -1, `cur` remains -1, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` (-1) as a key and its value incremented by 1.***
