Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `N`. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.***
