The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cur`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `T` is greater than 1
- `_` is 2
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key
- `cur` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- `cur` must still be greater than `i`, so `cur` must be greater than 1

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key, `cur` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
