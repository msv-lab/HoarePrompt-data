Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If `N` contains no such integers, `cur` remains -1, and `M` is a dictionary with -1 as the key and the count of all elements in `N` as its value.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `T` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `S` remains the input integer.
- The variable `N` is still the sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `cur` is set to the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1. If no such integer exists, `cur` remains -1.
- The dictionary `M` contains keys that are the integers in `N` which are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If no such integers exist, `M` contains -1 as the key and the total number of elements in `N` as its value.
