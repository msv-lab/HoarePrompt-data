Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. The variable `cur` has not been set yet.**

Explanation: The code snippet `S = int(input())` updates the value of `S` to an integer provided by the user. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged, and the variable `cur` has not been set yet.
