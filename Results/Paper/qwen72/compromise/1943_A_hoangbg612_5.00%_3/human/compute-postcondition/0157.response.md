Output State: **`T` is 0, `_` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key. `cur` is the smallest index `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` remains unchanged and is equal to its initial value.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `T` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variable `_` is `T-1`, which means it has reached the last iteration index.
- The variable `S` is an input integer, representing the number of integers in the list `N` for the last test case.
- The variable `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user for the last test case.
- The variable `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key.
- The variable `cur` is the smallest index `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` remains unchanged and is equal to its initial value. This `cur` value is the result printed for the last test case.
