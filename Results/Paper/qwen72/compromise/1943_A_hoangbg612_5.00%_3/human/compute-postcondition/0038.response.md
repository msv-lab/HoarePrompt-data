To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

1. **Loop Head**: `for i in range(cur):`
   - The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `cur - 1`.

2. **State Before the Loop**:
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`.
   - If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, incremented by 1.
   - If `N` contains no such integers, `cur` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with -1 as the key and the count of all elements in `N` as its value.
   - Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and `M` is unchanged.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0.

Given the conditions, the loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0. The state of `cur` is the only one that directly affects whether the loop will execute. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `M`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cur` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cur` must be greater than 0**
