Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
