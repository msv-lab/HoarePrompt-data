Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `M[cur]` after the increment depends on its initial value, which is not provided. All other conditions from the initial state are still valid.
