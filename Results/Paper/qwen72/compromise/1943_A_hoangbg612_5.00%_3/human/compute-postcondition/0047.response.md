The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur` and the current value of `i`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `M` is a dictionary as described. The variable `i` is 1, and `cur` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `cur` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which will be 2).

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`, `i` is 2, and `cur` must be greater than 2**
