The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `T`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2, and `T` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any) where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).**
