To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a dictionary as described.
   - `cur` is the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any) where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).

2. **Understanding `cur`:**
   - We need to find the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` such that:
     - `N[i]` is exactly one more than `N[i-1]`.
     - `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.
   - If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Suppose `N` is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`.
   - The last integer in `N` is 8.
   - We need to check each index from the start to the last integer in `N` to find the first `i` where `N[i]` is exactly one more than `N[i-1]` and `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `N[1] = 2` and `N[0] = 1` (2 is exactly one more than 1).
     - Check `M[1]` (if `M[1]` is less than or equal to 1).
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `N[2] = 3` and `N[1] = 2` (3 is exactly one more than 2).
     - Check `M[2]` (if `M[2]` is less than or equal to 2).
   - For `i = 4`:
     - `N[4] = 6` and `N[3] = 5` (6 is exactly one more than 5).
     - Check `M[4]` (if `M[4]` is less than or equal to 4).
   - If no such `i` is found, `cur` will be the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `cur` will be the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that satisfies the conditions, or the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer if no such index exists.

Output: **cur (where cur is the first index i in the range of the last integer in N that is exactly one more than the previous integer in N and M[i] is less than or equal to i, or the last integer in N that is exactly one more than the previous integer if no such index exists)**
