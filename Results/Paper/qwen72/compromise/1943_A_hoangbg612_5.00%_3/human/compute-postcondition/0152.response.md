Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2.**

The value of `cur` is now 2, as it has been assigned the value of `i`, which was 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
