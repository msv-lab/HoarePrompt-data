Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `N`. This is a good approach because the MEX of an array is determined by the smallest missing non-negative integer, and sorting helps in identifying the sequence of numbers more easily.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX**: The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX. It is initialized to -1, which is appropriate because we start checking from 0.

4. **Building the Frequency Dictionary**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the sorted array. This is useful for determining how many times each number appears.

5. **Updating the Current MEX**: The program iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` to the current number if it is greater than the previous `cur`. If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is missing, and if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.

6. **Checking the Total Frequency**: The program checks if the sum of the frequencies in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If it does, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest missing integer, not by the total frequency.

7. **Final MEX Calculation**: The program iterates through the range from 0 to `cur` and checks if the frequency of the current number `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If it is, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This step is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer that is not in the array, not based on the frequency of the numbers.

8. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. This is the correct output format.

However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The correct approach should be to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been processed. The program's current logic does not correctly handle this.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            elif num > cur:
                break
        print(cur)
```

This corrected version correctly determines the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
