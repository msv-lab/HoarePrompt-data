Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading the integer `S` (which is the size of the array `N`) and the list of integers `N`.

2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted, which is a necessary step to determine the MEX efficiently.

3. **Dictionary Construction**: The dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of consecutive integers in the sorted array `N`. The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is used to track the current MEX candidate.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means the current MEX is `cur + 1`, and the loop breaks.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented.

5. **Final MEX Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it means all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array, so `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - The second loop checks if any integer `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` has a count in `M` that is less than or equal to `i`. If such an integer is found, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.

6. **Output**: The function prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `M` is initialized but not used correctly for all elements. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` should break the loop, but the dictionary `M` should not be used to track counts of elements that are not consecutive. Instead, it should track the presence of elements.

- **Final MEX Calculation**: The final MEX calculation should be simplified. The loop that checks the counts in `M` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler check.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
        
        print(cur)
```

Explanation of the corrected function:
- **Initialization**: `cur` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through the sorted list `N`. If the current element `num` is equal to `cur`, it means `cur` is present in the list, so `cur` is incremented by 1.
- **Output**: After the loop, `cur` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `N`, which is the MEX.

Given the original function and the issues identified, the original function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
