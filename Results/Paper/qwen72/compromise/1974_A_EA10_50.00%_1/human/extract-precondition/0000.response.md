Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.** However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func(x, y):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
