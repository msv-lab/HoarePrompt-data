The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems to accept multiple parameters. The parameters include `t`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. However, given the context, it is likely that the function processes these inputs to return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` (integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
