Output State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 4` and `r` must be greater than -2, `end` is `end + 2`**

Explanation:
- `r` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is `n - 4`.
- Since `r` was initially `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than -1, the new value of `r` must be greater than -2.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
