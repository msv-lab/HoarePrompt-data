To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `r > l`**
   - Given that `r` is `n - 1` and `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `r` is at least 1.
   - `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal. Since `l` is initially set to `st`, and `st` is `l`, this means `l` is initially 0.
   - Therefore, `r > l` is already true because `r` is at least 1 and `l` is 0.

2. **Condition 2: `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
   - This condition checks if the last element in the list `a` is equal to the second-to-last element.
   - For the loop to execute, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal.
- `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is `l`.
- `end` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true. Since `r` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that the last element of the list `a` is equal to the second-to-last element.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 0**
