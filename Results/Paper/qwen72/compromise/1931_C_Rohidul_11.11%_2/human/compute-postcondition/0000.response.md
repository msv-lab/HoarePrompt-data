The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as the range function requires a non-negative integer, and if it's 0, the loop won't run.

Given the state before the loop starts, the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This means the input to the loop must be a positive integer within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive**
