Output State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 4` and `r` must be greater than -2, `end` is `end + 3`**

Explanation:
- The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1.
- Initially, `end` was `end + 2`.
- After the code execution, `end` is now `end + 3`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
