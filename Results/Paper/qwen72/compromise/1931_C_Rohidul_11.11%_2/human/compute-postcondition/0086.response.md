Output State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 2` and `r` must be greater than 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
