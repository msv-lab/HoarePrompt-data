Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements, but the most frequent element is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The expected output is `3` because the minimum cost to make all elements equal is to set the middle three elements to `2`, which costs `3` burles. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The program only considers the cases where the first and last elements are the same or where the array is already uniform, but it fails to consider the optimal cost when the most frequent element is not at the edges.
