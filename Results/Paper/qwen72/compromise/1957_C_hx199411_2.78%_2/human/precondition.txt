t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n and k, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5) representing the size of the chessboard, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of moves already played. The subsequent k lines contain two integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n), denoting the i-th move made by the player. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
