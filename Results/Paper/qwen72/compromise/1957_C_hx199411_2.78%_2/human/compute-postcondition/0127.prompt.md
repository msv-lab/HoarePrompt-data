Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, with 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is 1, no further changes occur. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and specific values are assigned to `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, etc., up to `dp[m]` as calculated by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of times `c` and `r` were compared, which is either `k` if `c == r` for all comparisons, or `2 * k` if `c != r` for all comparisons, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. If `m` is 1, the value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `m + 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
