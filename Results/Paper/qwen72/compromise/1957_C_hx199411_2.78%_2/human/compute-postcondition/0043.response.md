The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, meaning `t` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1` (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again)**
