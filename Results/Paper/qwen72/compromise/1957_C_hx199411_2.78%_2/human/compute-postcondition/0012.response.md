The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is 1; `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
