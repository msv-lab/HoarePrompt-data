To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0. After input, `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is an input integer where \(0 < k \leq n\).
   - `i` is set to `m`.
   - `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
   - `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
   - The first few elements of `dp` are explicitly set: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 7`, `dp[4] = 25`, and so on up to `dp[m]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is not directly relevant to the `print(dp[m])` statement.
   - `n` and `k` are used to determine `num`.
   - `i` is set to `m`, but it is not used in the `print(dp[m])` statement.
   - `c` and `r` are used to calculate `num`.
   - `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 based on the equality of `c` and `r` pairs over `k` iterations.
   - `m` is derived from `n` and `num` and must be at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list where the first few elements are predefined, and the rest are calculated in a loop.

3. **Calculating `dp[m]`:**
   - The list `dp` is initialized with zeros and then populated with specific values.
   - The values of `dp` are calculated in a loop, but the exact formula for the loop is not provided. However, the first few values are given: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 7`, `dp[4] = 25`, and so on.
   - The final value `dp[m]` is the result of this calculation.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the final value in the list `dp` after all calculations are done.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be the value of `dp[m]`, which is the final value in the list `dp` after all calculations are completed.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the final value in the list dp after all calculations are completed)**
