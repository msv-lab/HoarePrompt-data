Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. `n` and `k` are integers input by the user with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations. `i` is `k-1`. `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user. `num` is the total number of times `c` and `r` were compared, which is either `k` if `c == r` for all comparisons, or `2 * k` if `c != r` for all comparisons. `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` is 0 or 1, the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, so `i` will be `k-1` at the end.
- `num` will be incremented by 1 if `c == r` and by 2 if `c != r` for each iteration. Therefore, `num` will be between `k` and `2 * k` depending on the values of `c` and `r`.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`, and its value will depend on the final value of `num`.
- The `dp` array is updated based on the value of `m` as described in the loop body.
