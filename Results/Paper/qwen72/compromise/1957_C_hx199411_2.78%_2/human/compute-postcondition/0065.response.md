The code snippet `m = n - num` calculates the difference between `n` and `num` and assigns the result to `m`. The values of `n` and `num` are used directly in this calculation. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) are not affected by this code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, and it is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user.
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`. Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `m` is assigned the value `n - num`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`.**
