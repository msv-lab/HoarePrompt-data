For the given task, the loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero). Given that `t` is an integer input by the user representing the number of test cases, the loop will execute at least once if `t` is greater than 0.

Since the state right before the loop indicates that `t` is an integer input by the user, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, with 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
