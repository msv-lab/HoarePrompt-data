### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks the sum of `a` and `b` for the last test case only, which is incorrect. The logic should be applied to each test case, not just the last one.
   - The correct logic for determining the winner is based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins in the wallets. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game is symmetric, and the player who starts with an odd total number of coins can always force a win by ensuring the opponent is left with an even number of coins.

3. **Output**:
   - The program should print the result for each test case, but it only prints the result for the last test case. This is a significant error.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only processes the last test case and prints the result for that case, rather than processing and printing results for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
