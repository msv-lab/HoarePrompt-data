The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('bob  ')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This indicates that there are `t` test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints a string literal `'bob  '`.

### Output:
The code prints the string literal 'bob  '.
Output: **bob  **
