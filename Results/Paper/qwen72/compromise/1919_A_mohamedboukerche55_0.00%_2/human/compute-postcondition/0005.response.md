Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('alice')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'alice'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **alice**
