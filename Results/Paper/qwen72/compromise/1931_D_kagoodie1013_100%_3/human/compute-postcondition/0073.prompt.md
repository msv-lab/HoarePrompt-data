You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and an integer y (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `results` list contains the value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` value represents the total number of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which contains the value of `count` for each tuple in the `test_cases` list. Each `count` value represents the total number of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs in the corresponding list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `results` list, which contains the value of `count` for each tuple in the `test_cases` list. Each `count` value represents the total number of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
