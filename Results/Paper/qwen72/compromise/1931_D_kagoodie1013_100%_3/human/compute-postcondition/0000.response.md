Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and an integer y (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
