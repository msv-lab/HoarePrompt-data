Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `arr` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in `arr`, `results` is a list that now includes the value of `count`.**
