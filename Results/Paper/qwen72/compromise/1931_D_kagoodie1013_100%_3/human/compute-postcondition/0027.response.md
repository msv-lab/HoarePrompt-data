The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Given the state before the loop starts, `arr` must have `n` elements, where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
