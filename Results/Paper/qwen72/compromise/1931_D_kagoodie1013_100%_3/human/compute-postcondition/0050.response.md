The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `arr` will always have at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, to be precise and adhere to the task, we need to ensure that the loop can start its first iteration. This means `num` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged and must have at least 3 tuples, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
