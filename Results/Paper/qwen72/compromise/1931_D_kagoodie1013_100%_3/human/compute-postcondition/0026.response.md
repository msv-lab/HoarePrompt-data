Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have `n` elements, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes `residue_map` as an empty dictionary, but does not modify any other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `count` remains unchanged. The `residue_map` is now an empty dictionary.
