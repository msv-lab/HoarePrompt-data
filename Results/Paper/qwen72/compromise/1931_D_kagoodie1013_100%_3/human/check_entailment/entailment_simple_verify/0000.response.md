Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to count the beautiful pairs. Specifically, the calculation of `r_x` and `r_y` and their usage in the `residue_map` is not entirely accurate for the problem's conditions.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - However, the condition for `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` should be checked using `num % x` and `a_j % x` (i.e., both numbers should have the same remainder when divided by `x`).
   - The condition for `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` should be checked using `num % y` and `a_j % y` (i.e., both numbers should have the same remainder when divided by `y`).

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - The issue lies in the fact that the program is using `r_x = -num % x` instead of `num % x` for the first condition. This is incorrect because `-num % x` does not necessarily give the same remainder as `num % x` when `num` is positive.
   - For example, if `num = 1` and `x = 5`, then `-1 % 5` is `4`, but `1 % 5` is `1`. This means that the program is counting pairs that do not satisfy the condition `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case, but due to the incorrect residue calculation, the counts are not accurate.

To correct this, the program should use `num % x` for both `r_x` and `current_key`:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed residue calculation for the condition `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x`. The corrected version of the program should use `num % x` for both `r_x` and `current_key` to ensure the conditions are met accurately.
