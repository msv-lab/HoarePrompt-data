Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true, and `j` is 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n` holds true. If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j > n` holds true.***
