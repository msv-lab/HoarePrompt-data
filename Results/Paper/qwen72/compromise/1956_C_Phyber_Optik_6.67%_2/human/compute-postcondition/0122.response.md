Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n`.
2. `n` is a new input integer.
3. `j` is 2.
4. `t` is unchanged (we don't have information about its initial value, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
5. `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't have information about its initial value, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
6. `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
7. `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't have information about `r`, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
8. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator unpacks the sequence, so each integer in the range will be printed separated by spaces.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
