Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't have information about `t`, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't have information about `_`, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't have information about `r`, so it's not relevant to the print statement).
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 2 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter means that the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` will be printed.
   - The value of `j` (which is 2) will be printed.
   - The output will end with a space.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1 2 **
