Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
- `j` remains `n + r`, but since `r` is now 2, `j` is `n + 2`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `_` remains reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` remains the same, as it is calculated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
