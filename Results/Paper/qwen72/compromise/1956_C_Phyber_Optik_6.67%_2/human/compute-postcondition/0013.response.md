The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2
- `r` is 2
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n` and `r` is 2.

We need to determine the initial value of `sum` based on the condition:

1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
2. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n`.

Let's evaluate the condition:

- `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `i * n` is `2 * n`.

For `n >= 2`:
- `n * (n + 1) // 2` is always greater than `2 * n` because the sum of the first `n` natural numbers grows faster than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the initial value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

Now, the code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value.

So, the new value of `sum` is:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `sum = 2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`
- `sum = n * (n + 1)`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `r` is 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1)`**
