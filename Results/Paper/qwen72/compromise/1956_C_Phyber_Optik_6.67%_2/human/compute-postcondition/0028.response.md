Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, where `j` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Calculating `j % n`:**
   - Given `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0, `j % n` will always be 1 because 1 modulo any positive integer is 1.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2` followed by `1` with a space in between.

Output: **2 1**
