Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true, and `j` is 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n` holds true. If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j > n` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is incremented to 2, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 3, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
