Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n` for each iteration, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains `n` throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`j`**: The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. After the loop finishes, `j` will be `n + r`.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- **`_`**: The variable `_` is incremented by `n` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n + r` times, `_` will be incremented by `n * (n + r)`.
- **`sum`**: The value of `sum` is calculated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. For each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `sum` includes `n * (n + 1) // 2`. For each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `sum` includes `i * n`. The loop iterates `n + r` times, and the value of `sum` is the cumulative sum of these values.

In summary, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r`, `_` will be incremented by `n * (n + r)`, and `sum` will be the sum of the values as described above. The variables `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
