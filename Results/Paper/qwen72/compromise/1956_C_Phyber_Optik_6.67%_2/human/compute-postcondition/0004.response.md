The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range function will generate a sequence from 1 to `n` inclusive, and this requires `n` to be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified by the range function.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1**
