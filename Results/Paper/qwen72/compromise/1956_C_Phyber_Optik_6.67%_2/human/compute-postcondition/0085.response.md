To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- `n + r` must be at least 3.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` is not explicitly provided, but it is an input integer. We need to determine the range of values that `n` can take based on the initial state.
2. **Variable `r`**: The value of `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. This implies that `r` is a value that satisfies the inequality, but we don't have the exact value of `n` to compute `r`.
3. **Condition `n + r >= 3`**: This condition must be satisfied, but it doesn't provide a specific value for `n` or `r`.

Given the lack of specific values for `n` and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Code Execution:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

### Output:
Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
