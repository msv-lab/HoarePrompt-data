Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is 3, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n`, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` remains less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, `j` remains greater than `n`.***
