The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `j` is `n + r` where `r` is 0 or 1. `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `sum` is `3 * n`. `r` is 2 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `r` is 0 or 1.**
