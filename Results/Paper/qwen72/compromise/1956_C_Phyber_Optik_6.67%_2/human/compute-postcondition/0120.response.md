Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n`.
2. `n` is a new input integer.
3. `j` is 2.
4. `t` is unchanged (we don't have information about its initial value, so it's not relevant to this task).
5. `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't have information about its initial value, so it's not relevant to this task).
6. `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
7. `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't have information about `r`, so it's not relevant to this task).
8. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` before `range(1, n + 1)` in the `print` statement unpacks the range object, so the integers are printed separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is mentioned as a new input integer.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, the sequence will be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
- If `n` is 3, the sequence will be `1, 2, 3`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
