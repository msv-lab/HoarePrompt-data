The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, and `t` is unchanged.

Given this, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 to continue the loop. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, `i`, `sum`, and `t`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`j` is `n + r`, `n + r` must be at least `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer.**
