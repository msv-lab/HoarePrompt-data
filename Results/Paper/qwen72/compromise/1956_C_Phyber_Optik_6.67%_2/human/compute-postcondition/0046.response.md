Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**

The code snippet `sum, r = 0, 0` updates the values of `sum` and `r` to 0. The other variables (`j`, `t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
