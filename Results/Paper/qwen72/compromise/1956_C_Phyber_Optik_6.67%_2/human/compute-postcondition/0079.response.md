To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n + r` must be at least 2.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: The variable `n` is an input integer. Since it remains the input integer, we need to determine what `n` is based on the initial state.
2. **`range(1, n + 1)`**: This function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The initial state does not provide an explicit value for `n`, but it does give us some conditions and relationships involving `n`.
- The condition `n + r` must be at least 2 implies that `n` and `r` are both integers and their sum is at least 2.
- The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, which further simplifies to `n + 1 > 2 * n` or `1 > n`. This implies that `n` must be less than 1, but since `n` is an integer and `n + r` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1.
- Therefore, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.

### Conclusion:
- If `n` is 1, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1]`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1, 2, ..., n (where n is the input integer)**
