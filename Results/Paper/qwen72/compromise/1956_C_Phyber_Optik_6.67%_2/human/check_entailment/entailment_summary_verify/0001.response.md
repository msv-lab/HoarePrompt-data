### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either assigning a permutation to a row or a column.

2. **Maximum Possible Sum:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n \) because each element can be at most \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements.
   - This can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to \( n \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - The program then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on the condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
     - This condition is incorrect for maximizing the sum. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not relevant to the problem and does not help in achieving the maximum sum.
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, but the logic for determining the type of operation and the row/column index is flawed.
     - The operations are not correctly generated to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is incorrect and does not contribute to the correct sum calculation.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are based on this incorrect condition.
   - The operations printed do not follow the optimal strategy of filling each row and column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. It uses an incorrect logic for sum calculation and operation generation, leading to an incorrect solution.

Final: **False**
