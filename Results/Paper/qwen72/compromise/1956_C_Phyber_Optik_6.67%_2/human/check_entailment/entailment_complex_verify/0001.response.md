### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i, j} \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Possible Sum:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n \) because each element can be at most \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements.
   - This can be achieved by filling every element in the matrix with \( n \).

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can use the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and each column.
   - By applying Type 1 operations to all rows and Type 2 operations to all columns, we ensure that each element in the matrix is set to \( n \).

4. **Number of Operations:**
   - We need to perform \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column).
   - This totals \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the matrix after performing these operations is \( n^2 \times n \) because each element is \( n \).

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on a condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
     - This condition is incorrect for maximizing the sum. The correct sum should be \( n^2 \times n \).
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, but the logic for determining the type of operation and the row/column index is flawed.
     - The operations should be \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, but the program does not ensure this.

7. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` does not make sense in the context of maximizing the sum.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect.
   - The operations printed do not follow the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. It uses an incorrect logic for sum calculation and operation generation.

Final: **False**
