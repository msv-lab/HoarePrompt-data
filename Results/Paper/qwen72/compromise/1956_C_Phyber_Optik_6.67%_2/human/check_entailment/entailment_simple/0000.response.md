Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the sum of the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The program's logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop that iterates from 1 to \( n \). However, the sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized, and the maximum sum is achieved by filling the entire matrix with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) multiplied by \( n \) (since each integer appears in every row and column).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program outputs \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is the last value of \( i \) for which \( n \times \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) > i \times n \). This logic is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the number of operations will be no more than \( 2n \). The correct approach should be to use exactly \( 2n \) operations to ensure the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program's output format is incorrect. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The operations should be in the format specified in the problem statement, but the current implementation does not follow this format correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
