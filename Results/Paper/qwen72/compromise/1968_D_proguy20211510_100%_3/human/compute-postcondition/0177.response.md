The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `paths`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `paths` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `paths` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must have at least three elements.

State: **`i` is 2, `paths` must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * k`**
