Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
