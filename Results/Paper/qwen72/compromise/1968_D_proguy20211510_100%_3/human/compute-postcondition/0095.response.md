To determine what will be printed by the `print('Draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pres` is updated to `pres + sum(paths[:min(k, len(paths))])`.
   - `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`.
   - `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`.
   - `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
   - `curr` is `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`.
   - `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
   - `paths` must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
   - `ress` is less than or equal to `resb`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('Draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Draw'.
   - The values of `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, and `ress` are not directly used in the print statement, but they are part of the initial state and context.
   - The condition `ress` is less than or equal to `resb` is given, but it does not affect the output of the print statement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the string 'Draw' regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
