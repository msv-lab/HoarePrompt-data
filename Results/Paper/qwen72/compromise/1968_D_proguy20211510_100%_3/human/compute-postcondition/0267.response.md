Output State: **`pres` is `paths[0]`, `resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum of 0 and `paths[0] * k`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `i` is 1, `paths` must have at least two elements, `curr` is `paths[0] * k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
