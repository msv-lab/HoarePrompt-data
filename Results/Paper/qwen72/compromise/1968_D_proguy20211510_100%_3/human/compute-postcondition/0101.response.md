Output State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` remain unchanged.**

The value of `p` is updated to a list of integers based on user input. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis`) remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
