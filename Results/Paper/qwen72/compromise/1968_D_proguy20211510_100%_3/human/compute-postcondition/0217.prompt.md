Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except `vis[pb - 1]` is now 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. `paths` is an empty list. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except `vis[pb - 1]` is now 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` was 1, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. `paths` is an empty list. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except `vis[pb - 1]` and `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` are now 1. `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and if `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` is 1, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]` is also included. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except `vis[pb - 1]`, `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and if `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` is 1, `vis[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]` are now 1. `pb` is updated to `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]` if `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains as `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
