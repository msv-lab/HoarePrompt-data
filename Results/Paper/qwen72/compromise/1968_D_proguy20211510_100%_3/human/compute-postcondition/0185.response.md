The `print('Bodya')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Bodya'. The precondition provides information about the state of the program, but it does not affect the output of this specific print statement. The variables and objects mentioned in the precondition (`i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `resb`) are not used in the print statement, so their values do not influence what is printed.

Output: **Bodya**
