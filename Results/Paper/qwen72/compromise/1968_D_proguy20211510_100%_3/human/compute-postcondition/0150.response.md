Output State: **`vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `pres` is 0. `preb` is now `pathb[0] * k`. `resb` is now `max(0, pathb[0] * k)`. `curr` is now `pathb[0] * k`. `ress` is 0. `i` is 0. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index.**
