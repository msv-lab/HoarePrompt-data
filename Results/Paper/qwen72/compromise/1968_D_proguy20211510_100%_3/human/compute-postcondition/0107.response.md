Output State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` adds the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `pathb`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `pathb` now contains one element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. The list `paths` remains empty, and the list `vis` retains its initial state, with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1.
