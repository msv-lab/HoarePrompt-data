Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `pb` is now the integer value of `p[pb - 1]`. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `pb` is now the integer value of `p[pb - 1]`. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `pb` is now the integer value of `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
