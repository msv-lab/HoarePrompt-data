Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
