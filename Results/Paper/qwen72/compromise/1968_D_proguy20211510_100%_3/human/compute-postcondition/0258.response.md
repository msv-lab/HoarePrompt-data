Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`. `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least `len(pathb)` elements, `i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- `resb` will be the maximum value obtained from the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1`, but only if `k` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
- `ress` remains 0.
- `preb` will be the sum of all elements in the list `pathb`.
- `pres` remains 0.
- `pathb` is a list that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop completed.
- `i` will be the index of the last element in `pathb`, which is `len(pathb) - 1`.
- `curr` will be the last computed value of the expression `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`.
