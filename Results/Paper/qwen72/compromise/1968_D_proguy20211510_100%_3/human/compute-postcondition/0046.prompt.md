Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is now equal to `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is now equal to `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the loop continues.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
