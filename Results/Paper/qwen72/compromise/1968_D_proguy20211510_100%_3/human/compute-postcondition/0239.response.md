The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pathb`. If `pathb` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that the loop has already finished executing, but for the loop to start executing, `pathb` must have at least 1 element and `i` must be 0.

State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
