Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation:
- `resb` was initially the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.
- `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.
- All other variables (`ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, `i`) remain unchanged.
