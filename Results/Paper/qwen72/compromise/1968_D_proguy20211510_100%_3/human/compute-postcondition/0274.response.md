Postcondition: ***`pres` is `paths[0] + paths[1]`, `resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `i` is 2, `paths` must have at least three elements, `curr` is `paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
