Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, and `k` is less than `i + 1`.**
