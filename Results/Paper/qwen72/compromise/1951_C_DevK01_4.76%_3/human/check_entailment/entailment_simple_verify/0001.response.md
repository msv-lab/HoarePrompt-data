### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The initial state of the program is correctly described. The inputs are parsed and stored as expected.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is necessary and correctly implemented. It ensures that the program does not attempt to buy more tickets in a day than needed.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good approach because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will minimize the total cost.
   - **Annotation Verification:** Sorting the prices is a valid and efficient strategy to minimize the cost. The sorted list `M` is used to select the cheapest days.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, given that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The calculation of `q` is correct and follows the problem constraints.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** This step is correct. The program is selecting the cheapest days to buy tickets.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. This formula calculates the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers multiplied by `m * m`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The cost calculation formula is correct for the case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m`. The additional cost due to price increases is correctly computed.

   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the program:
     - Pops the last element `w` from `N` and calculates `mu` as the remaining tickets to be bought (`k - (n - 1) * m`).
     - Calculates the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day as `mu * w`.
     - Calculates the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining `n-1` days as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`.
     - Adds the additional cost due to the price increase on the last day as `n * m * mu`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The cost calculation formula is correct for the case where `k` is not exactly divisible by `m`. The program correctly handles the remaining tickets and the price increases.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The output is correctly formatted and printed for each test case.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and where it is not.
  - The program also handles the edge case where `m` is greater than `k` by setting `m` to `k`.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it sorts the list of prices and performs a few arithmetic operations for each test case.
- **Correctness of Formulas:**
  - The formulas used for cost calculation are derived correctly from the problem constraints and are implemented as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
The program's logic is sound, and it correctly follows the problem constraints and requirements. The cost calculation formulas are derived and implemented correctly, and the program handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
