To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start from 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The state before the loop starts does not directly affect the loop's execution, but the input value does. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
