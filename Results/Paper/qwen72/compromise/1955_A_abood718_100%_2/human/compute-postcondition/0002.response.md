The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or process values for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it uses integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30) to compute and return a result.**
