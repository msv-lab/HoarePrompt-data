The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. Depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, it computes and prints a result according to the following rules: if `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2` (as an integer); if `A` is odd, it prints `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, and these values remain within their initial ranges after the function completes.
