Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `length` is 30 or 31, and the string `s` remains unchanged unless the first character of `s` is '1' and the second character is '-1'. In this case, the second character of `s` is set to '0', and the rest of the string `s` remains unchanged. If the 3rd character of `s` (index 2) is '-1' and the 2nd character (index 1) is '1', the 3rd character is set to '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.***
