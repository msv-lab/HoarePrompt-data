Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is greater than 1, `s[1]` is '0', `s[0]` is '-1'.**

The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the value at the index `i - 1` of the list `s` to '-1'. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, so `s[0]` is changed from '1' to '-1'. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
