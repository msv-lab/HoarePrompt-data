Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` is a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0. If `flag` is 1, the first string in `s` is '0' and the condition `(flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'))` is still false. If `flag` is 0, the condition `(flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'))` is false, so either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
