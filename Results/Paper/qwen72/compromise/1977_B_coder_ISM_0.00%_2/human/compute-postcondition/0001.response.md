The only variables in the loop head are `nalla` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `x` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `nalla` will start at 0.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0**
