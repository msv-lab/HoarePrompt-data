Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` has not been modified and still represents the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the variables `n` and `l` have been used to process the input, and the variable `e` has been set to a set of unique elements from `l`. The variable `m` has been set to the length of the list `l`. The loop has printed 'Bob' if any pile contains exactly 1 stone, and 'Alice' otherwise. The values of `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` will be different for each test case, but they will not affect the next test case.**
