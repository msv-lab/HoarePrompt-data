The function `func` is described with the following constraints but lacks the parameter list in the provided function signature. Based on the constraints, it seems the function should accept the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it should accept the number of piles `n` and a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. However, since the function signature does not specify these parameters, I will assume they are passed in a way that the function can process them (e.g., as arguments within a loop or as a list of lists).

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles.
- A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact output is not specified, but it is implied that the function returns some form of result based on the number of stones in each pile.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of piles `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It returns a result for each test case based on the number of stones in the piles.**
