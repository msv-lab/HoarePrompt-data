Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in the third condition. The formula used to calculate the profit when `b - a < n` is incorrect.

Let's break down the problem and the correct logic:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price doesn't offer any advantage.
   - The profit is `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}
     \]

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `k = b - a + 1` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is:
     \[
     \text{Profit from remaining buns} = (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]

The program provided uses the formula:
\[
\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n
\]
This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the correct number of buns sold at the modified price. The correct formula should be:
\[
\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \times (2b - (b - a + 1) + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a + 1)) \times a
\]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            k = b - a + 1
            profit_from_first_k = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            profit_from_remaining = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_first_k + profit_from_remaining)
```

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
