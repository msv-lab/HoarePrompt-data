Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If so, it means the modified price is not more advantageous than the usual price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it means the modified price can be applied to all buns, and Bob should sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which is given by the formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means the modified price can only be applied to a subset of buns. The program calculates the profit for the buns sold at the modified price and the buns sold at the usual price. The profit for the modified price buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - (b - a) + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\). The profit for the remaining buns is `a * n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` and where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the general case where `b - a` is less than `n`.

5. **Arithmetic Series Calculation**:
   - The arithmetic series calculations are correct and follow the standard formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{k \cdot (2a + (k-1)d)}{2}\), where `a` is the first term and `d` is the common difference.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient and works within the constraints provided (1 \le t \le 10^4 and 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
