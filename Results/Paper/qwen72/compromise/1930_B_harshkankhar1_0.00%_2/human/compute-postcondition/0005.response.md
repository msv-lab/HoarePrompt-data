Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. It generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. The function then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) while keeping the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) unchanged. Finally, it prints the modified list `a`. The function does not return any value. **
