Output State: `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive elements in `arr`, index of the last positive element in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of positive elements and the start and end indices of that segment, `max_sum` is -1. 

Note: If `arr` contains no positive elements, `max_segment` will be [0, 0] and `segments_variants` will be an empty list.
