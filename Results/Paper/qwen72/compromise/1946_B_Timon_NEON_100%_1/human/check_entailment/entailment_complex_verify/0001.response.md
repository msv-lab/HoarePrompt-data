### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, ensuring the final sum is within the required modulo.
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists, but they are used as if they were single integers.
     - The `segments_variants` list is not properly managed, and the logic for appending segments is flawed.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum of the subarray.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to understand that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can keep adding it to the array to maximize the sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best we can do is to add zero (i.e., an empty subarray) `k` times, which does not change the sum.

4. **Code Review:**
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray but fails to do so correctly.
   - `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to the solution.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The main loop reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
   - It then computes the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The result is printed after applying `func_1`.

6. **Issues in the Annotated Code:**
   - **func_2**:
     - The initialization of `new_segment` and `max_segment` as lists is incorrect. They should be initialized as integers.
     - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is flawed. It should only append valid segments.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum of the subarray.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. It should be `max_segment[0] * k + sum(a)`.
     - The use of `2 ** k` is incorrect for this problem. The correct approach is to multiply the maximum segment sum by `k` and add it to the initial sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and does not implement the logic to compute the final sum after `k` operations correctly. The issues in `func_2` and the main logic formula need to be addressed.

Final: **False**
