### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly \( k \) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - This is a standard operation to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
     - **Correctness:** True. The function correctly computes the modulo operation.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum segment of non-negative numbers in the array `arr`.
     - It maintains a list `segments_variants` to store segments of non-negative numbers along with their start and end indices.
     - It also maintains `max_segment` to keep track of the current maximum segment sum.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
       - It appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even when `new_segment` is empty, which is incorrect.
       - The final return value `total_max_segment` is not correctly determined. It should return the maximum segment sum, but it is currently returning a list with the sum and indices, which is not what the main program expects.
     - **Correctness:** False. The function does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum and its indices.

   - **Function `func_3`:**
     - This function is not used in the provided code, so it does not affect the correctness of the program.
     - **Correctness:** Irrelevant.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result after applying `func_1` to the answer.

4. **Issues in the Main Program:**
   - The main issue is with `func_2`. If `func_2` returns an incorrect segment sum, the final answer will be incorrect.
   - The formula used to calculate the final answer is not correct. The maximum possible sum should be the sum of the entire array after \( k \) operations, which involves repeatedly adding the maximum segment sum to the array.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with `func_2` and the incorrect formula in the main program, the provided program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
