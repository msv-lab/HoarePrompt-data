### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is correctly implemented and will be useful for the final step of the problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices. However, the implementation is flawed:
       - It does not correctly handle arrays with all negative numbers.
       - It does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum subarray is the entire array.
       - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - The function summary provided indicates that this function should return a list containing `quantity` elements, each with the value of `number`. However, the actual implementation of `func_3` is incomplete and does not match the summary. It currently only initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program lacks the main logic to perform the `k` operations and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array.
   - The provided functions do not collectively solve the problem as described.
   - The program does not handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the required functionality to solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is not implemented at all. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
