The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the sum of the maximum segment of non-negative numbers in `arr`, the starting index of this segment, the ending index of this segment, and the last index of `arr`. If no non-negative numbers are present, the function returns a list with `-1` as the first element and the last index of `arr` repeated twice.
