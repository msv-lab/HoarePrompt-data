### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires transforming an initial state `s1` to a desired state `s2` using the minimum number of operations. The operations are:
     - Adding a cat to an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Analyzing the Operations:**
   - Adding a cat to an empty box is necessary when `s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`.
   - Removing a cat from a box is necessary when `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`.
   - Moving a cat from one box to another can be done in one operation, but it does not change the overall count of cats that need to be added or removed.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Days:**
   - The number of days required is determined by the maximum of the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - This is because you can add and remove cats independently, and the limiting factor is the larger of the two counts. For example, if you need to add 3 cats and remove 2 cats, you can do this in 3 days by adding one cat per day and removing one cat per day for the first 2 days, and adding the last cat on the third day.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cats to add (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats to remove (`cats_to_remove`).
   - It then returns the maximum of these two values, which is the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and prints it.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the initial and desired states are the same (e.g., `s1 = "1"` and `s2 = "1"`), which requires 0 days.
   - It also handles cases where the number of cats to add and remove are different, correctly returning the maximum of the two.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of days required to transform the initial state to the desired state. It accounts for all the necessary operations and edge cases.

Final: **True**
