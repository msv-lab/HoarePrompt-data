Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description requires a function to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) is designed to solve a completely different problem. It appears to be a dynamic programming solution for a path traversal problem where `@` and `*` are used to represent different states or obstacles. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
