Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) does not solve the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions are designed to solve a path traversal problem with `@` and `*` characters, which is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

The annotations for `func_1` and `func_2` confirm that the program is interpreting the input as a sequence of `@` and `*` characters, and is using dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `@` signs that can be collected while avoiding `*` signs. This is not the behavior required by the problem description, which needs to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs to determine the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect for the given problem description is correct.

Final: **False**
