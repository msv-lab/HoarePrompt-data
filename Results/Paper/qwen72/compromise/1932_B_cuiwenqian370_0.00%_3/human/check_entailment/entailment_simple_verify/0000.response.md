Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) is not designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. Instead, it appears to be a dynamic programming solution for a path traversal problem where `@` and `*` are used to represent different states or obstacles. The problem statement requires a function to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The provided program does not handle the periodicities or the sequential waiting for signs to occur. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
