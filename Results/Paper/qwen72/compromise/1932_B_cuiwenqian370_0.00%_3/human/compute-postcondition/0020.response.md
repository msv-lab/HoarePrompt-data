Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `dp` represents the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected up to that index, considering the constraints imposed by '*' signs. If an element in `path` is '*', the corresponding element in `dp` is `-inf`. If an element in `path` is '@', the corresponding element in `dp` is the maximum value of the previous two elements in `dp` plus 1. If an element in `path` is a sign's periodicity (not '@' or '*'), the corresponding element in `dp` is the maximum value of the previous two elements in `dp`.**
