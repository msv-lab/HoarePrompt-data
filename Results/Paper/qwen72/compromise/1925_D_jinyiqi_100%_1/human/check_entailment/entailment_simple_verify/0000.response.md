Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the formula used in the program is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values using a formula that does not accurately reflect the dynamic nature of the friendship values as they change over the excursions.

### Key Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the program:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times \binom{n}{2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - This formula does not correctly account for the changing friendship values over the excursions. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the friendship value of a selected pair should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the current friendship value of that pair.
   - The expected value for each excursion can be derived as follows:
     - The probability of selecting a friend pair is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
     - The expected increase in the friendship value for a friend pair is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \left( \text{current friendship value} + 1 \right) \).
   - The sum of these expected values over all excursions should give the correct expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- Here, \( n = 3 \), \( m = 1 \), and \( k = 2 \).
- There is one friend pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
- The total number of possible pairs is \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \).

**Expected Value Calculation**:
- Probability of selecting the friend pair (1, 2) in any excursion: \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Expected increase in friendship value for the first excursion:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + 1) = \frac{2}{3}
  \]
- After the first excursion, the friendship value of (1, 2) becomes 2.
- Expected increase in friendship value for the second excursion:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times (2 + 1) = 1
  \]
- Total expected increase in friendship value over both excursions:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{5}{3}
  \]
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values is \( \frac{5}{3} \).

However, the program's formula does not correctly capture this dynamic change in friendship values, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program's formula is incorrect and does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program needs to be revised to correctly account for the changing friendship values over the excursions.

Final: **False**
