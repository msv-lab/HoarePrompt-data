Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Combination Calculation**: The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is correct for combinations.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values `f_i` for all pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the incremental increases due to repeated selection of the same pairs.

5. **GCD and Simplification**: The program correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse**: The program uses the `pow` function to compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is a standard and efficient way to handle such computations.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result of the modular inverse calculation, which is the required output for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
