Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 1 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`sum_f`**: After all iterations, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
- **`j`**: After all iterations, `j` is `m-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`.
- **`a`, `b`, `f`**: These are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`cn2`**: Remains `n * (n - 1) // 2` as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`p`**: Updated to `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd` after all iterations.
- **`q`**: Remains `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd` as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`gcd`**: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` is calculated based on the updated values of `p` and `q`.
