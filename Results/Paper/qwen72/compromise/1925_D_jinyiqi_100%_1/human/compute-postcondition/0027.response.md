The value of `sum_f` is incremented by the value of `f`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the new input integers read from the input during the current iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
