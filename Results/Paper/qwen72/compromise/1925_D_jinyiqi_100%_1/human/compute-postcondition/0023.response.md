The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new input. The other variables in the initial state (`t`, `i`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`) remain unchanged unless they depend on the updated values of `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned new values from the input.
- `t` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations (unchanged, but may be recalculated later if `m` changes).
- `j` is `m-1` (unchanged, but may be recalculated later if `m` changes).
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration (unchanged, but may be recalculated later if `m` changes).
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2` (will be recalculated with the new value of `n`).
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd` (will be recalculated with the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`).
- `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd` (will be recalculated with the new value of `n`).
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` (will be recalculated with the new values of `p` and `q`).

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
