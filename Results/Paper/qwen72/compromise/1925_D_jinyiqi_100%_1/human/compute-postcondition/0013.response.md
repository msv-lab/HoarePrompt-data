The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to its current value. Given the initial state, `sum_f` was initially `f + f`, which means it was twice the value of `f`. After executing the code, `sum_f` will be `f + f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `3 * f`, `j` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input.**
