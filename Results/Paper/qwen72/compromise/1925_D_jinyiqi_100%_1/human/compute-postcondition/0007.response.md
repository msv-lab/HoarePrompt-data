Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, `f` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Initially, `sum_f` was 0, so after the execution, `sum_f` is now equal to `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
