The value of `sum_f` is updated by adding the value of `f` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (sum_f + f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
