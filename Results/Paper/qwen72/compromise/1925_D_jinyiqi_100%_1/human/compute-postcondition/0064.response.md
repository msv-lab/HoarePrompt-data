The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the test cases and their respective values. The function likely processes these parameters to perform some operations and returns results based on the conditions specified.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` are integers where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
  - All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct.
  - The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists of `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It processes these parameters and returns results based on the specified constraints and relationships.**
