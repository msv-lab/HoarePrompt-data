To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `k` are input integers.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `cn2`**:
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`
   - This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is a combinatorial value.

2. **Calculate `p`**:
   - `p = (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
   - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` is the product of 2, `k`, `cn2`, and `sum_f`.
   - `m * k * (k - 1)` is the product of `m`, `k`, and `k - 1`.
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

3. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q = (2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`
   - This simplifies to `q = (2 * cn2) // gcd`.

4. **Calculate the Modular Inverse**:
   - `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
   - The modular inverse of `q` is a number `x` such that `(q * x) % M == 1`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` computes the result of multiplying `p` by the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`, and then taking the result modulo `M`.

### Final Output:
The code prints the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, which is the modular inverse of `q` multiplied by `p` and then taken modulo `M`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the modular arithmetic operation described.

Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where `p` and `q` are computed as described above, and `M` is a constant used for modular arithmetic)**
