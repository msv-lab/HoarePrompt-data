The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, where `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i`), also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`. The function does not modify the input parameters `q` and `x`.
