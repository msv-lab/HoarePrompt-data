The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, a list of integers `a` representing the beautiful array, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array. The parameters `t`, `a`, and `n` satisfy the following constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` for the number of test cases, a list of integers `a` representing a beautiful array, and an integer `n` for the length of the array. It processes each test case and returns the result for each case.**
