#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func_1` is defined with an input parameter `n` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable is now 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. The loop has printed the cumulative sums for each `n` in the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) from the user. It calculates and stores the cumulative sums of a specific sequence of values for each integer `n` in a list `sum_values`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value.
