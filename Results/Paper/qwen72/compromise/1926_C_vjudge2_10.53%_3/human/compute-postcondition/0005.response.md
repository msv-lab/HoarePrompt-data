Output State: **The function `func_1` is defined with an input parameter `n` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1`, where each element is initialized to 0.**
