Output State: The `values` list remains unchanged, containing the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n`. The `sum_values` list remains unchanged, containing the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. The loop prints the cumulative sum for each value of `n` in the `numbers` list.
