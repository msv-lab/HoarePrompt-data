Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func_1` is defined with an input parameter `n` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]

        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable is now 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)

    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. The loop has printed the cumulative sums for each `n` in the `numbers` list.
