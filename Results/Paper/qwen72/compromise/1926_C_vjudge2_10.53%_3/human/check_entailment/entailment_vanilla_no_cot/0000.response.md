Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Initialization of `n` in the loop**:
   - The variable `n` is used both to store the input for each test case and as the upper limit for the loop that calculates the sum of digit sums. This can lead to incorrect results when the maximum number in the list of test cases is smaller than the current test case's `n`.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1)` should be `for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1)` to ensure that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are correctly populated up to the maximum number in the test cases.

3. **Handling of Remainder**:
   - The calculation of `remainder` using `int(word[:-1])` can lead to incorrect results when `i` is a single-digit number. For example, `int("10"[:-1])` results in `1`, but `int("9"[:-1])` results in `0`, which is incorrect.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program can be optimized to avoid converting integers to strings and back, which is inefficient and may exceed the time limit for large inputs.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_n` is calculated as the maximum number in the list of test cases to ensure the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are correctly sized.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - The digit sum for each number `i` is calculated using a generator expression inside the `sum` function, which is more efficient and avoids the need for string slicing.

3. **Cumulative Sum**:
   - The cumulative sum is updated correctly for each number up to `max_n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final result for each test case is printed using the precomputed `sum_values` array.

This corrected program should work correctly and efficiently within the given time limit.
