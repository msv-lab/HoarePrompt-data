Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., 0 0 0), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will output "STAIRS" for the input `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is not properly checked for equality. The correct condition should be `a < b and b < c` to avoid this issue.
