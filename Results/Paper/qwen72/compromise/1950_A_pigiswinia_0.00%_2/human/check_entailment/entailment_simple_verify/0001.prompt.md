You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is done using `t = int(input())`. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, processing each test case. This is done using `for i in range(t):`. This is correct as it matches the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it splits the input string into three parts and converts each part to an integer, which matches the problem description.

4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIRS". This is almost correct, but the output should be "STAIR" (as specified in the problem description).

5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This is correct as per the problem description.

6. **Condition for Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as per the problem description.

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, but it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" for the stair condition.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output for the stair condition.

Correctness: **False**
