The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) from the user input. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output produced.
