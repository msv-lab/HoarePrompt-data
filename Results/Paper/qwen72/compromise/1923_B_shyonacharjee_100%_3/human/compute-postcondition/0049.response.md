Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a` and must have at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is equal to the first health in the first tuple of `monsters`, `pos` is the first position in the second tuple of `monsters`, `health` is the first health in the second tuple of `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` remains True if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
