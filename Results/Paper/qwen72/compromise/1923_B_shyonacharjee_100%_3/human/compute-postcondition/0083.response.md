Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a` and must have at least 2 tuples, `pos` and `health` are the values of the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, `can_survive` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.***
