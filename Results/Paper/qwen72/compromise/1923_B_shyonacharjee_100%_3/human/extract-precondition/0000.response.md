Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described. A correct function definition would be:**

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

**Where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two lists: the first list contains integers `n` and `k`, and the second list contains two lists of integers `a` and `x` such that:**

- **1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4**
- **1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5**
- **1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9**
- **1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
- **-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0**
- **The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
