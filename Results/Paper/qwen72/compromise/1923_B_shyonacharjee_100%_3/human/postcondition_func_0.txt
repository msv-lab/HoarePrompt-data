The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x`. It then processes these inputs to determine if it is possible to survive by checking if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of health values in `a`) is less than or equal to the product of the maximum distance (absolute value of positions in `x`) and `k`. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to survive and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
