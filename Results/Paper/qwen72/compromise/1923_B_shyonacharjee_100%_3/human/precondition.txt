The function `solve` is expected to be called multiple times, each time processing a test case. Each test case includes an integer n representing the number of monsters, an integer k representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second, a list of integers a representing the health of each monster, and a list of integers x representing the initial positions of each monster. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
