The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` that contains the characters from `s`, rearranged according to the sorted order of the list `d`. The characters are first sorted by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order, and then by their original positions in descending order.
