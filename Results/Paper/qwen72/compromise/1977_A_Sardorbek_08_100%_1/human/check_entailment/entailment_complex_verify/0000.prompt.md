You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer. The loop has executed a times, and for each iteration, it has printed 'YES' if b == c, 'NO' if b < c, 'Yes' if b % 2 == c % 2, and 'No' otherwise. The values of b, c, and q are not retained after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then checks the following conditions for each test case: if `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'; if `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'; if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `b`, `c`, and `q` are not retained. The function does not modify any external state or variables outside its scope.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (number of cubes), if `b` is less than `c`, and if `b % 2 == c % 2`. However, it should only check if the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c` is the same, because the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem, it is possible to end up with 2 cubes after 4 moves (put 1 cube, put 1 cube, remove 1 cube, put 1 cube). However, the program will output "No" because it checks `b < c` and `b % 2 == c % 2` separately, which is incorrect. The correct logic should only check if `b % 2 == c % 2`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
This version correctly checks the parity of `b` and `c` and will output the correct result for all potential cases.
