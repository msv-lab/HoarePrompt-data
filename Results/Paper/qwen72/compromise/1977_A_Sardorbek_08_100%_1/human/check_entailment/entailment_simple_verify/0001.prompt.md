You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer. The loop has executed a times, and for each iteration, it has printed 'YES' if b == c, 'NO' if b < c, 'Yes' if b % 2 == c % 2, and 'No' otherwise. The values of b, c, and q are not retained after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube per move. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition checks if both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). If they do, it is possible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs and then add one more cube to end up with `c` cubes.
     - This condition is correct.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If the parities of `b` and `c` are different, it is impossible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa, the number of moves cannot result in the desired number of cubes.
     - This condition is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description. The output is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" are acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
