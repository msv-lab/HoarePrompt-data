The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, and `m` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
