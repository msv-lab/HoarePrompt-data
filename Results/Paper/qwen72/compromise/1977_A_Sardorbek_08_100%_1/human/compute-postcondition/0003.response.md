The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates under the context of multiple test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the example.

Since the function's output is not specified, we can only infer that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases and process integers `n` and `m` within the given constraints. The exact return value or behavior is not clear without more information.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
