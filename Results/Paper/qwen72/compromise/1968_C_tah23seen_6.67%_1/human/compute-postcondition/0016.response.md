Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0] + 1` otherwise `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, `ans[2]` is `arr[1] + ans[1]`, and `ans[2]` is now `arr[1] + ans[1] + ans[1]`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 1.**
