The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)), `ans[i]` is initially set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is updated to the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
