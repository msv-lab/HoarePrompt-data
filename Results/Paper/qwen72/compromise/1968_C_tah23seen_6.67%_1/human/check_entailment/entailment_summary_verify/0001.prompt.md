You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)), `ans[i]` is initially set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is updated to the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `a_2 % a_1` should equal `x_2`, and setting `a_1` to `arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_2 % a_1` can be `arr[0]`.

4. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This is a valid choice because `a_{i+1} % a_i` should equal `x_{i+1}`, and setting `a_{i+1}` to `arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i` will be `arr[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, the program enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i` will be `arr[i]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This is a valid choice because `a_n % a_{n-1}` should equal `x_n`, and setting `a_n` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1}` will be `arr[-1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case, which should satisfy the given conditions.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 4`, `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5`
  - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9`
  - `ans[3] = ans[2] + arr[2] = 9 + 1 = 10` (but the program sets it to 9 + 1 = 10, which is correct)
  - Output: `3 5 9 10` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 3`, `arr = [1, 1]`
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `ans[2] = ans[1] + arr[1] = 3 + 1 = 4` (but the program sets it to 3 + 1 = 4, which is correct)
  - Output: `2 3 4` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 6`, `arr = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]`
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 4 + 5 = 9`
  - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 2 + 9 = 11`
  - `ans[3] = arr[2] + ans[2] = 5 + 11 = 16`
  - `ans[4] = arr[3] + ans[3] = 1 + 16 = 17` (but the program sets it to 16 + 1 = 17, which is correct)
  - `ans[5] = ans[4] + arr[4] = 17 + 2 = 19` (but the program sets it to 17 + 2 = 19, which is correct)
  - Output: `5 9 11 16 17 19` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 2`, `arr = [500]`
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501`
  - `ans[1] = ans[0] + arr[0] = 501 + 500 = 1001` (but the program sets it to 501 + 500 = 1001, which is correct)
  - Output: `501 1001` (which is correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 3`, `arr = [1, 5]`
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `ans[2] = ans[1] + arr[1] = 3 + 5 = 8` (but the program sets it to 3 + 5 = 8, which is correct)
  - Output: `2 3 8` (which is correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
