The code snippet `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns this list to the variable `sl`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2` (an integer less than or equal to `n / 2`), `sl` is a list of characters from `s`.**
