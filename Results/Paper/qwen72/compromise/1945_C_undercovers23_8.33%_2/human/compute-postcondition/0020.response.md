Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
