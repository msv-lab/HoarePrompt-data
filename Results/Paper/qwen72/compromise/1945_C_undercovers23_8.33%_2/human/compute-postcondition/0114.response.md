The code snippet `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is assumed to be an element from this list. The value of `mini` is updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `lst` must contain at least one element.**
