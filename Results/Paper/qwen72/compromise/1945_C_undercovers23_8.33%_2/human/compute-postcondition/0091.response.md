Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`. `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Since `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 1.
- Therefore, `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 1)`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(zero * 100)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
