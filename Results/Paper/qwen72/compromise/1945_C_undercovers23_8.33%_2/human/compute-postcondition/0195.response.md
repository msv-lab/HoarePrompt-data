Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` contains the first element of `lst` and the second element of `lst`, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the second element (`elem`) of `lst` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contained the first element of `lst` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` was equal to `mini`), after executing the code, `final` now contains both the first and the second elements of `lst`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
