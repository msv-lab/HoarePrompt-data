Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is [1], `i` is 1. If `s[i] == '0'`, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 or 1, otherwise `zero` is 1 or 0 and `one` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` calculates the value of `zero_perc`.
- Given `i` is 1, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 2.
- The value of `zero` can be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `s[1]` is '0' or not.
- Therefore, `zero_perc` will be either `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 2) = 50` or `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 2) = 100`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this calculation.
