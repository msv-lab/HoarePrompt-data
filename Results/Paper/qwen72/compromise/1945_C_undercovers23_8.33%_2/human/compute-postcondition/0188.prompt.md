Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`. The list `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the percentage of zeros up to index `i` is at least 50% and the percentage of ones from index `i + 1` to the end of the string is also at least 50%. The variable `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total count of '0' characters in `s` up to the second last character, `one` is the total count of '1' characters in `s` up to the second last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `mini` is updated to `min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele))`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele))`, `lst` must have at least one more element, all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele), abs(pk - ele))`, `lst` must have at least two more elements, all other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
