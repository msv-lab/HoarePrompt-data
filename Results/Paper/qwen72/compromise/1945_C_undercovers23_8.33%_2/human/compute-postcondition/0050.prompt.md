Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute value of `pk - ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, and `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute value of `pk - ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, and `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute value of `pk - ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
