The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` adds the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `one_perc` also remains unchanged as it was already updated in the initial state.

Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` includes the value `i + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
