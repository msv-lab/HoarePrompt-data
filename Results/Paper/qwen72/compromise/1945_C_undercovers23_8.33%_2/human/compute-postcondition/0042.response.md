Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variables `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` will reflect the final state of the loop, while `lst` will contain all the indices where the conditions for appending to the list were met. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
