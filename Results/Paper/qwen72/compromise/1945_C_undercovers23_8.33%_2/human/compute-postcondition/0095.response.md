Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is [1] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`. `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`.***
