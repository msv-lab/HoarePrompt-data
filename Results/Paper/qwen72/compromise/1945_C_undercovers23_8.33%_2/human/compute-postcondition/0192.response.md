Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, `lst` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first element of `lst` (which is `elem`) to the list `final`. As a result, `final` now contains this element. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
