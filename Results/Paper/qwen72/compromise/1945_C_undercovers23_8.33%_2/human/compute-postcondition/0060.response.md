The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, and `final` is either an empty list or contains `elem` if the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` was met.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0
   - `s` is an input string
   - `pk` is `n // 2`
   - `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
   - `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
   - `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
   - `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character
   - `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character
   - `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`
   - `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`
   - `lst` must contain at least 3 elements
   - `elem` is the third element in `lst`
   - `final` contains `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is an empty list

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `elem` is appended to `final`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `final` now contains `elem`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `final` contains `elem`.**
