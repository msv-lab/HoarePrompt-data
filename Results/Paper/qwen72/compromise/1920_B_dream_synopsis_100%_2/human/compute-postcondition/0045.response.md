Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sum1 = sum(a)` recalculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns it to `sum1`.
- Since `sum1` was already defined as the sum of the elements in `a` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `sum1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The structure and content of the list `ans` remain as described in the initial state, including the calculation of its elements based on the conditions provided.
