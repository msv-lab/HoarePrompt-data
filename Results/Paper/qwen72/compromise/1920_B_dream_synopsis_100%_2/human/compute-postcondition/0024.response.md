The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
