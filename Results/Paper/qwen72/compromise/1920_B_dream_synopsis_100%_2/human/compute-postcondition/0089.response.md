Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x]` is a slice of the list `a` from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `x`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the elements in this slice.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` is twice this sum.
- `sums` is then calculated by subtracting `2 * sum(a[:x])` from `sum1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
