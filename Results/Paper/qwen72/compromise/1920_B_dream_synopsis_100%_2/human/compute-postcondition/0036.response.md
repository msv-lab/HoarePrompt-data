Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]` and `ans` now includes the value of `sums`.***
