The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sums + a[k]`, which means it includes the sum of the elements in `a` plus the element at index `k` of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k]`, and `(i + x - 1)` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
