The code snippet appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Here’s the detailed impact:

- `ans` is initially a list containing two elements. After the code executes, `ans` will contain three elements, with the third element being the current value of `sums`.
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` before this line of code, but this update is not part of the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `sums` remains unchanged in this context.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the third element is the value of `sums`.**
