Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
