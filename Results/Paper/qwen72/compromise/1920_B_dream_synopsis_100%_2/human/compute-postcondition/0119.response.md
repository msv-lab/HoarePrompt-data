Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `k + 1`, and the list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, where each element reflects the value of `sums` at each step of the loop. The first element in `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and each subsequent element is updated according to the specified conditions within the loop.
