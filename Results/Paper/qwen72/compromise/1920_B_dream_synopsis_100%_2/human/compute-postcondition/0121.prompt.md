Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is calculated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
