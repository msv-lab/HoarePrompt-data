Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specified that `ans` was a list containing `k + 1` elements, but after executing the code, `ans` is now an empty list.
