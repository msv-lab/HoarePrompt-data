Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (`n`, `k`, `x`) and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to consider removing the smallest elements first, which helps in maximizing the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated. This is the sum before any operations are applied.

4. **Dynamic Calculation of Sums**:
   - The program iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (`i` from 0 to `k`).
   - For each `i`, it calculates the sum after Alice removes `i` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.
   - The initial sum `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` when `i == 0`. This accounts for Bob multiplying the largest `x` elements by -1.
   - For subsequent values of `i`, the sum is adjusted by adding back the element Alice removed and subtracting twice the element Bob multiplies by -1.

5. **Result Collection**: The program collects all possible sums in the list `ans` and prints the maximum sum for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `i + x - 1 < n` to ensure it does not access out-of-bounds indices.
   - It also handles the case where `i + x - 1 >= n` by simply adding the element Alice removed without considering Bob's operation.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob and compute the maximum possible sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
