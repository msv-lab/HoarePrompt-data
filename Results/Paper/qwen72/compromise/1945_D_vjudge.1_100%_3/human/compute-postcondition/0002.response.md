The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the list `suff`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1` before the first iteration. The list `suff` is already initialized to the correct length and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0**
