Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `c` remains a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is 0. `ans` is now set to positive infinity.**
