### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill wants to move from the end of the queue (position `n+1`) to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - For each move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill pays `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person at positions `k` such that `j < k < i`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` which takes the number of people `n`, the maximum allowable final position `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates a new list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is because Kirill can choose to pay either `a[i]` or `b[i]` when moving past the `i`-th person.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of moving past a certain position.
   - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to each of these positions. The cost is the sum of `a[i]` (the cost to move to position `i`) and `suff[i + 1]` (the cost to move past all positions from `i+1` to `n`).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The calculation of `c` is correct because it ensures that Kirill always pays the minimum cost to move past each person.
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly computed in reverse order, which allows for efficient calculation of the total cost of moving past a range of positions.
   - The loop that calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to the first `k` positions is also correct. It iterates over the possible final positions and updates the minimum cost accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill can stay in his original position without paying any coins).
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (Kirill must move to the first position).

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to a position within the first `m` positions.

**Correctness: True**
