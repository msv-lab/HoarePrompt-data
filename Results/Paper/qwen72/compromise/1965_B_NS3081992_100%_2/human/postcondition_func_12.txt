The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not 0). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the values by calling itself with `b` and `a % b`.
