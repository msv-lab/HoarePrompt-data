The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It writes the output of `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. After the function concludes, the standard output will contain the results of `func_14()` for each test case, each on a new line. The state of `func_10()` and `func_14()` remains unchanged.
