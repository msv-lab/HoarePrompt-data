Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that meets the specified conditions for a given `n` and `k`. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly addresses the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the sequence for the given `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Generation in `func_14()`**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates its length `l`.
   - If `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `1\n2`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with 2 and 3, and then appends powers of 2 up to \(2^{l-1}\). This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.
   - If `k != 1`:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\) to cover the remaining range of values.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, separated by a newline.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No subsequence sums to `k`**:
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence starts with 2 and 3, and no subsequence can sum to 1.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and ensuring that the sum of the sequence elements does not include `k`.

- **All other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences**:
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence contains all powers of 2 up to \(2^{l-1}\), which can form any value from 1 to `n` except 1.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{l-1}\) and additional elements to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` and `k == 1` correctly by returning `1\n2`.
- The program ensures that the sequence size is at most 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate the required sequence for the given problem constraints and conditions. The logic is sound and covers all the necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
