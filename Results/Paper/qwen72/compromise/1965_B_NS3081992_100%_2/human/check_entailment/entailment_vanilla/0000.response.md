### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the sequence.

2. **Sequence Generation in `func_14()`**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates its length, `l`.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.
   - If `k != 1`, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It converts `k` to its binary representation and calculates its length, `lk`.
     - It initializes the sequence with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence is less than `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure the sequence can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.
     - It appends powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself as a string.
   - The main function `func_15()` writes the output for each test case.

4. **Validation**:
   - The sequence generated should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - The sequence should have subsequences that sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The sequence length should be at most 25.

### Analysis:
- **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
  - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1.
  - For `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by appropriate subsequences.

- **General Case for `k != 1`**:
  - The sequence is constructed by including powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, ensuring that the sum of these elements is less than `k`.
  - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to make the sum of the sequence just below `k`.
  - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
  - The remaining powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)` are added to cover the higher values up to `n`.

- **Sequence Length**:
  - The sequence length is at most 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.

Correctness: **True**
