To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `ans` is [2, 3].

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, l):
       ans.append(2 ** i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`.
   - In each iteration, `2 ** i` is appended to the list `ans`.

4. **Determine the Length `l`:**
   - `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `b = '101'` and `l = 3`.

5. **Loop Execution:**
   - For `i = 2`, `ans.append(2 ** 2)`, which appends `4` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 3`, `ans.append(2 ** 3)`, which appends `8` to `ans`.
   - This continues until `i = l - 1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `ans` will have the initial values [2, 3] and then the values of `2 ** i` for `i` from 2 to `l - 1`.

Let's assume `n = 5` for a concrete example:
- `b = '101'`
- `l = 3`

The loop will execute:
- For `i = 2`, `ans.append(2 ** 2)`, so `ans` becomes [2, 3, 4].

If `n = 10`:
- `b = '1010'`
- `l = 4`

The loop will execute:
- For `i = 2`, `ans.append(2 ** 2)`, so `ans` becomes [2, 3, 4].
- For `i = 3`, `ans.append(2 ** 3)`, so `ans` becomes [2, 3, 4, 8].

Since `n` is not specified, we will use the general form to describe the output state.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains the same as returned by `func_7()`.
- `k` remains 1.
- `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` remains the length of `b`.
- `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, ..., 2 ** (l - 1)].

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `k` is 1, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, ..., 2 ** (l - 1)].**
