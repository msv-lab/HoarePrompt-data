Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum distance `k` that a bullet can travel. It then reads two lists: `a`, which contains the health of each monster, and `x`, which contains the positions of each monster. The function determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters by shooting them in an order that minimizes the total distance traveled by the bullets. If it is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' results have been printed. **
