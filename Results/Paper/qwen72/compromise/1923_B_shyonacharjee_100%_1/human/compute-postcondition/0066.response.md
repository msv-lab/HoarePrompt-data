Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the loop completes without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `x` to be a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `x` is a list of integers, which is the result of converting the user input (split by spaces) into integers.
