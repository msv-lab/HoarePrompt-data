You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets you can fire per second `k`.
   - It then reads the health of each monster `a` and their initial positions `x`.
   - The program uses `zip` to pair each monster's position with its health and sorts these pairs based on the absolute value of the position. This ensures that the closest monsters are considered first.

2. **Monster Handling and Bullet Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `bullets_used` to 0 and `can_survive` to `True`.
   - It iterates over the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character (`distance = abs(pos)`).
   - It calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill the current monster (`total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health`).
   - It checks if the total number of bullets needed exceeds the maximum number of bullets you can fire before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`).
   - If the condition is met, it sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met, it adds the health of the current monster to `bullets_used`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all monsters for a test case, it prints 'YES' if `can_survive` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified.
- The logic for determining if you can survive is based on the idea that you need to kill each monster before it reaches the character. This is done by checking if the total number of bullets used so far plus the health of the current monster exceeds the maximum number of bullets you can fire before the monster reaches the character.
- The sorting step ensures that the closest monsters are considered first, which is crucial because you need to prioritize killing the closest monsters to avoid them reaching you.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It follows the constraints and the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
