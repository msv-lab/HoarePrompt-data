### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating a new string `r` which consists of all distinct letters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character in `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on).

2. **Understanding the Decoding Process:**
   - To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We need to reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - Once we have `r`, we can map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` using the symmetric replacement.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the character mappings.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - For each character in the encoded string `encoded`, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
     - If it is, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
     - If it is not, it iterates through the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a letter that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
     - It then maps this letter to the current character in `encoded` and appends the letter to the `decoded` list.

5. ** Issues with the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - The mapping is not based on the distinct characters in the encoded string, but rather on the first available letter from 'a' to 'z' that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
   - This approach will not correctly decode the string because it does not follow the symmetric replacement rule based on the distinct characters in the encoded string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem. It fails to reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b` and does not use the symmetric replacement rule correctly. Therefore, the output will not match the expected decoded string.
