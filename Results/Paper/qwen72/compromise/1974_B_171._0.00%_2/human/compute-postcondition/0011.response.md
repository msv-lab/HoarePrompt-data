The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`. The loop iterates over the range from the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) to the ASCII value of 'z' (which is 122). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented to 98.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary except for the key 'a'. `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is 98.**
