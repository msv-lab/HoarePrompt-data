Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97 and `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`.***
