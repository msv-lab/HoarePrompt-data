The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means it goes from 97 to 122 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.

The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state (such as `encoded`, `decoded`, `mapping`, and `char`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted in the context of this task.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, `c` is 99, `mapping` remains unchanged**
