The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. So, we can only adjust `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` (which is 97) to `ord('z')` (which is 122) inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'c' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
