The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`, so we can only adjust `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and the range it is iterating over, which is from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1` (i.e., 97 to 122 inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98, and it must still be within the range (which it is, since 98 is less than 123).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
