Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, `c` is 99, `mapping` remains unchanged. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
