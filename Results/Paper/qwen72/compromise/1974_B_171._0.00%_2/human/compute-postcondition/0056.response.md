Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, and now includes an additional character 'z' at the end, `c` is 122, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`. The `mapping` dictionary now includes the first 26 characters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z') mapped to the corresponding characters from `encoded` that were not already in `mapping.values()`. If any character from `encoded` was not mapped to a letter in the alphabet, 'z' is mapped to that character, and subsequent characters from `encoded` are mapped to 'z' if 'z' is not already in `mapping.values()`.**
