Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 99, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `mapping` now includes the key 'c' mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`. If 'c' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
