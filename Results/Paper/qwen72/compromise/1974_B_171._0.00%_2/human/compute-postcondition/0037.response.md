Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `c` is 122. If `chr(c)` (which is 'z') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `c` will have the value 122, which corresponds to the character 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary will have been updated to include a key-value pair for the first character in `encoded` that was not already mapped to a value in `mapping.values()`, starting from 'a' and moving up to 'z'. If all characters from 'a' to 'z' were already in `mapping.values()`, the `mapping` dictionary will remain unchanged. The `decoded` list and the `encoded` string will retain their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
