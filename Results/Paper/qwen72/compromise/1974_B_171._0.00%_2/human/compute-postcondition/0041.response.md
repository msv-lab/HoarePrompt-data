Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is in `mapping`, the `decoded` list now includes the value of `mapping[char]` appended to it. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `decoded` now includes the character 'z' at the end, `c` is 122, and if 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`. If 'z' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. In both cases, `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**

In natural language: The `decoded` list is updated by appending the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`. The `encoded` string and the `mapping` dictionary remain unchanged, except that if `char` is not in `mapping` and 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, the `mapping` dictionary now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`. The variable `c` remains 122, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`.
