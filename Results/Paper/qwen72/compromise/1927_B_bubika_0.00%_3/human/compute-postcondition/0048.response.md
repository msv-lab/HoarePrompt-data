Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, and `r` is now `r + a[x]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r += a[x]` increases the value of `r` by the value of `a[x]`.
- The initial state specifies that `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`, so after this code, `r` is now `r + a[x]`.
- The value of `b[x]` is also increased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- The other variables (`s`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
