Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third integer in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is now `r + a[x]`**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated by adding `a[x]` to its current value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The index `x` is still the index of the third integer `i` in the list `b`, and `b[x]` is still increased by 1.
