Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the new input, `r` is an empty string, and a `NameError` is raised because `b` is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]` (unchanged from the initial state).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the second integer in the list `s`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]` (unchanged from the initial state)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the third integer in the list `s`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
