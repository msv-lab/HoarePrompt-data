Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n` and the sum of `n` over all test cases still hold. The condition about the existence of a valid string `s` for each test case also remains valid.
