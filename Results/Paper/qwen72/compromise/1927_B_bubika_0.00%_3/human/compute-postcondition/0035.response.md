Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the third integer in the list `s`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[x]` is increased by 1, so `b[x]` is now `b[x] + 1`.
- The value of `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`, so `r` is now `r + a[x]`.
- The values of `s`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions that `s` must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, and `x` is the index of the third integer in the list `s` are still valid.
