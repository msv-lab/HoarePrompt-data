Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the second integer in the list `s`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]` (unchanged from the initial state)**

Explanation:
- The code `r += a[x]` increases the value of `r` by the value of `a[x]`.
- `s` remains a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
- `i` remains the second integer in the list `s`.
- `x` remains the index of the second integer in the list `s`.
- `b[x]` is still increased by 1 from its initial state.
- `r` is now increased by the value of `a[x]` from its initial state.
