The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `t` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. The code does not affect `t` or `n`. The new variable `s` is now a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the input.**
