The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `s`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the new input, `r` is an empty string, and a `NameError` is raised because `b` is not defined.**
