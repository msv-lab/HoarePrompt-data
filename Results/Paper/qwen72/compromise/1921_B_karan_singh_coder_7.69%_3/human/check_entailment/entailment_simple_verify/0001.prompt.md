You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been completed, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` and `t` are strings of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `i` is `n-1`. For each test case, if `s1` is equal to `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is non-zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and the value `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s`, and the desired state `t`.

2. **Counting Cats:**
   - The program counts the number of cats in the initial state (`s1`) and the desired state (`t1`) using the `count` method.
   - This is necessary to determine if the number of cats needs to be increased or decreased.

3. **Calculating Mismatches:**
   - The program iterates through each box and counts the number of mismatches (`cnt`) between the initial and desired states.
   - A mismatch occurs when the state of a box in `s` is different from the state in `t`.

4. **Handling Equal Number of Cats:**
   - If the number of cats in the initial state is equal to the number of cats in the desired state (`s1 == t1`), the program checks if there are any mismatches (`cnt`).
   - If there are no mismatches, the program prints `0` because no operations are needed.
   - If there are mismatches, the program prints `s1` if `cnt` is non-zero. This is incorrect. The correct approach should be to print the number of mismatches `cnt` because each mismatch can be resolved by moving a cat from one box to another.

5. **Handling Different Number of Cats:**
   - If the number of cats in the initial state is different from the number of cats in the desired state, the program calculates the absolute difference `d` between `s1` and `t1`.
   - The program then calculates the minimum number of operations required as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.
   - This formula is correct because:
     - `d` represents the number of operations needed to either add or remove cats to match the desired number of cats.
     - `(cnt - d) // 2` represents the number of operations needed to move the remaining cats to their correct positions, as each move operation can resolve two mismatches (one cat moving out and one cat moving in).

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the handling of the case where the number of cats is the same in both states (`s1 == t1`).
- Instead of printing `s1` when `cnt` is non-zero, it should print `cnt` because each mismatch can be resolved by a move operation.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        t = input()
        s1 = s.count('1')
        t1 = t.count('1')
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        if s1 == t1:
            print(cnt)  # Corrected line
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
```

### Final Correctness:
- After the correction, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
