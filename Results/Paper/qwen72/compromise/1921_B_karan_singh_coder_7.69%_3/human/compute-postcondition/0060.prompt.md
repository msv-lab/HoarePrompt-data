Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and two strings s and f of length n where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and the string representation of `t` differ, and `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the string representation of `t`. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `s1` is not equal to `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `_` is incremented by `n`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no further changes occur. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is set to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
