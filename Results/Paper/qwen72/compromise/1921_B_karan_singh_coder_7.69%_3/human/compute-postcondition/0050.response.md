Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0 or 1.**
