Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` (which is 0) in `s` and `t` are not equal. If they are equal, `cnt` remains 0.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `s1`, `t1`, `s`, `t`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, and `t1` are still valid.
