Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function starts by checking a specific condition where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. If this condition is met, it returns 0. This is a hardcoded special case and should be reviewed for correctness in the context of the problem.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums after Alice's and Bob's actions.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the elements in the list and the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It appends the initial value `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - It then iterates over the number of removals, updating the sum `s` by subtracting the largest elements (since the list is sorted, the largest elements are at the end).
   - It updates `n` by adding the next largest element and subtracting the current largest element, handling `IndexError` if the index goes out of bounds.
   - It appends the updated value `s - 2 * n` to `pos` for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. This is because removing the smallest elements will have the least impact on the sum.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This is because multiplying the largest elements by -1 will have the greatest negative impact on the sum.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement Alice's strategy. It removes the largest elements (since it iterates from the end of the sorted list), which is not optimal. Alice should remove the smallest elements.
   - The function `func_2` also does not correctly handle the case where `negatives` is greater than `removals`. It should consider the smallest elements for Bob to multiply by -1, not the largest ones.

4. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The special case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 is hardcoded to return 0. This is not a general solution and should be removed or generalized.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, and the special case handling is not appropriate for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
