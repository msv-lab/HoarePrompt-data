Postcondition: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements), and elements is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= elements[i] <= 1000. Additionally, either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3.**
