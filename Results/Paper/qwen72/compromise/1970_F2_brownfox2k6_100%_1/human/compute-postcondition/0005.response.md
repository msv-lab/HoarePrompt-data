The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game. The function also uses two dictionaries, `player` and `blud`, where the keys are strings representing the players (e.g., 'R0', 'B1') and the values are lists of two integers representing the current coordinates of the players and the Bludger, respectively. The function returns the updated coordinates of the players and the Bludger based on the current time step `t`.
