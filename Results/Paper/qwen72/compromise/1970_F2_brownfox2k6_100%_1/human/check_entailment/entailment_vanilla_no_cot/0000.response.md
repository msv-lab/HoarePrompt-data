Correctness: **False**

**Reason:**

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle moving entities and checking for player elimination, respectively. However, the problem requires additional functionality such as:
   - Keeping track of the Quaffle's position and whether a player is carrying it.
   - Handling the scoring of goals.
   - Printing the final score.

2. **Missing Data Structures**: The program lacks the necessary data structures to store the positions of the players, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the goals. These are essential for the program to function correctly.

3. **No Main Logic**: The program does not include the main logic to process the input, simulate the game, and produce the required output. The main loop that processes each action and updates the game state is missing.

4. **Incorrect Player Elimination Handling**: The `func_2` function only checks for player elimination but does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, which should leave the Quaffle in the cell where the player was eliminated.

5. **No Scoring Mechanism**: There is no mechanism to check if a player has scored a goal and to update the score accordingly.

6. **No Final Score Output**: The program does not print the final score at the end of the game.

To be considered correct, the program should include all the necessary components to handle the game's rules, update the game state, and produce the required output.
