Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (n, m) and initializes the positions of the goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players.
   - The `carry` variable is used to track which player is carrying the Quaffle, and the `bs` and `rs` variables are used to track the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.

2. **Action Handling:**
   - The program iterates over the actions and updates the positions of the entities accordingly.
   - For catching the Quaffle (`C`), the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is now carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throwing the Quaffle (`T`), the program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score and the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - For moving entities (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), the program correctly updates the positions of the Quaffle, Bludger, and players using `func_1`.

3. **Bludger Elimination:**
   - The `func_2` function is called after each move to check if any player has been eliminated by the Bludger.
   - If a player is eliminated, their position is set to `[-1, -1]`, and the elimination event is printed in the correct format and order.

4. **Scoring and Final Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the scoring events and the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal by awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger and prints the events in the correct order.

6. **Overall Flow:**
   - The program follows the problem description and handles all the specified actions and events correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet all the requirements of the problem description and handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
