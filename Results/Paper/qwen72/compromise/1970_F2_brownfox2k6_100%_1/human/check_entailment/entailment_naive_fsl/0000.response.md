Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code snippets only cover two functions: `func_1` for moving an object based on a direction, and `func_2` for handling player eliminations due to a Bludger. However, the problem description requires a complete program that can handle the game logic, including scoring, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle. The provided code does not include these functionalities, and it also lacks the main logic to process the game steps and keep track of the score. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
