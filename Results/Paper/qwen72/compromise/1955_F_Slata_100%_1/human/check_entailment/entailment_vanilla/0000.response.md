### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins as many times as possible.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **XOR of Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:**
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 7 \)

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) will always result in a zero XOR for those pairs.
   - If the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is odd, removing one of these numbers will leave an odd number of the remaining types, which can be paired to zero out the XOR.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero: \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \).
   - It also checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) is 3, which indicates that removing one more number will make the XOR zero.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - The additional check for the sum of remainders being 3 is necessary to handle the case where the total number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd, and removing one more number will make the XOR zero.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
