Output State: **The loop will execute for a total of t iterations, where t is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output will be the sum of the integer division of each of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the input integers are odd. The state of the variables a, b, c, and d will be reset for each new test case, and the loop variable i will increment from 0 to t-1.**
