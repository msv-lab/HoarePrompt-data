The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
