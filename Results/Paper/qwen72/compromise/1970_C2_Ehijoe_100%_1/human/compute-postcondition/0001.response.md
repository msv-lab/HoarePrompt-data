Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list.**

The initial state remains the same, with the addition that the variable `edges` is now an empty list.
