Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains `n-1` edges added to the graph, `start` remains unchanged, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes `leaves` as an empty deque, which means `leaves` now holds an empty deque. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
