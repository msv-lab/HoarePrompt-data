The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. `n` and `t` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1. `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `start` is an integer representing the starting node, where 1 ≤ start ≤ n. The function returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within `t` steps.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. It returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within `t` steps, where `t` is always 1.**
