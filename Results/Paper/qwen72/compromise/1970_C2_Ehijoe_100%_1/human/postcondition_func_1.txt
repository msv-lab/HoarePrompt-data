The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. It then reads `n-1` edges to construct a graph represented as a dictionary `nodes`, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. The function identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one edge) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. It reads an integer `start` from input, representing the starting node. The function calls another function `func_1` with the graph `nodes` and the `start` node, and based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` contains the graph with `n-1` edges, `start` is the input integer, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` contains all leaf nodes, and `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.
