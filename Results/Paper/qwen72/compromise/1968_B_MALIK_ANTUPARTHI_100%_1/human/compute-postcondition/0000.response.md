Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is an integer input, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to an integer value provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
