### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.
   - We are allowed to make at most \( 3n \) queries.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), the length of the permutation.

3. **First Query Loop:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - For each \( i \), it queries \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}}) \) and \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates `mak` to \( i \).
   - This loop finds the index `mak` such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum element in the permutation.

4. **Second Query Loop:**
   - The variable `mak2` is initialized to `mak`.
   - The list `pans` is initialized to store indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR with `mak2`.
   - The loop iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - For each \( i \), it queries \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) and \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates `mak` to \( i \) and sets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is '=', it appends \( i \) to `pans`.
   - This loop finds all indices \( i \) such that \( p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}} \) is equal to the maximum value found in the first loop.

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0.
   - The loop iterates over the indices in `pans`.
   - For each \( i \), it queries \( (p_{\text{pans[mak]}} \mid p_{\text{pans[mak]}}) \) and \( (p_{\text{pans[i]}} \mid p_{\text{pans[i]}}) \).
   - If the result is '>', it updates `mak` to \( i \).
   - This loop finds the index in `pans` that, when XORed with `mak2`, gives the maximum value.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - The function prints the pair of indices \( (\text{mak2}, \text{mak}) \) that maximizes \( p_i \oplus p_j \).
   - The output buffer is flushed to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- **Query Complexity:**
  - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
  - The second loop makes \( n \) queries.
  - The third loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries.
  - Total queries: \( (n-1) + n + (n-1) = 3n-2 \), which is within the allowed limit of \( 3n \).

- **Correctness:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR with the maximum element.
  - The third loop correctly identifies the index in `pans` that, when XORed with `mak2`, gives the maximum value.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically sound and adheres to the constraints of the problem. It correctly identifies the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value using the allowed number of queries.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
