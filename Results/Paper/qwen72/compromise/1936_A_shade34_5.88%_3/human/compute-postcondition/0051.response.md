Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `_` has completed its iterations, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the new user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[2]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing `[1, 2]`.***
