The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
