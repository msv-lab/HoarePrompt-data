Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed. Since this operation does not affect any of the variables, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
