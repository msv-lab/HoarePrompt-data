Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
