Output State: **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is the new input integer greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and `mak` is the highest index for which the user input was `>` during the loop's execution. The output buffer has been flushed.**
