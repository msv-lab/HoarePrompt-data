Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is either 2 or 0, depending on the user input.
   - `i` is 3, as given in the initial state.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input is not `<`, then `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the user input is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the task requires the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Given that `mak` can only be 2 or 0, we can describe the output in terms of these possible values.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the user input is `<` and 0 otherwise)**
