Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` must have at least 4 elements.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` remains 0 or 1 based on the user input if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will start with the string `'? '`.
   - `pans[mak]` will be printed twice.
   - `pans[i]` will be printed twice.
   - `i` is 3, so `pans[i]` is `pans[3]`.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input is not '>', `mak` will be either 0 or 1.
     - If the user input is '>', `mak` will be 2.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is not '>', and `mak` is 0:
     - The print statement will be `print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[3], pans[3])`.
   - If the user input is not '>', and `mak` is 1:
     - The print statement will be `print('?', pans[1], pans[1], pans[3], pans[3])`.
   - If the user input is '>', and `mak` is 2:
     - The print statement will be `print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact user input is not provided, we need to consider all possible values of `mak`.
   - The output will be one of the following:
     - `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[3] pans[3]` if `mak` is 0.
     - `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[3] pans[3]` if `mak` is 1.
     - `? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3]` if `mak` is 2.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where `mak` is 0, 1, or 2 based on the user input, and `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements)**
