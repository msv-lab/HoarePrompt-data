Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
   - Since `mak` is 0 and `i` is 1, the print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
