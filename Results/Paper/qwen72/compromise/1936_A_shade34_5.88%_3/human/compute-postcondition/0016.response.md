Output State: **`_` is the loop control variable, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. However, this does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `_`, `n`, `i`, and `mak` remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed, which is already part of the initial state.
