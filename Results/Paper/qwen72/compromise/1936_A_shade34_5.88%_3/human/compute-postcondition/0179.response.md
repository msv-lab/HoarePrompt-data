Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is 0 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, or remains 0 if no `<` is found. `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.***
