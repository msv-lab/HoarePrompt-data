Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that equals `">"`, `mak` is set to 1. (However, the user input is not provided in the initial state, so we assume `mak` is not set unless explicitly stated otherwise.)

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print a string starting with `?`.
   - The next two elements to be printed are `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]`.
   - The last two elements to be printed are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `mak` is not explicitly set in the initial state, we assume `mak` is not defined or is `None` (or some other default value that would cause an error if used as an index). However, if we assume `mak` is set to 1 (as per the condition if the user input is `">"`), then:
     - `pans[mak]` will be `pans[1]` (the second element of the list `pans`).
   - `i` is 2, so `pans[i]` will be `pans[2]` (the third element of the list `pans`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `mak` is set to 1, the `print` statement will output:
     - `?` followed by the second element of `pans` twice, and then the third element of `pans` twice.

Since the user input is not provided, we can only assume the most likely scenario where `mak` is set to 1. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where [pans[1]] is the second element of the list `pans` and [pans[2]] is the third element of the list `pans`)**
