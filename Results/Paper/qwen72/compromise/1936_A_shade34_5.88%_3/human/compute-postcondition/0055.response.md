Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - It then prints `pans[mak]` twice.
   - It also prints `pans[i]` twice.
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1, so `pans[i]` will be `pans[1]`.
   - The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. This means `pans[mak]` will raise an `IndexError` if `mak` is out of bounds or a `NameError` if `mak` is not defined.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `mak` is not defined in the initial state, the `print` statement will raise a `NameError` and will not execute successfully.

Output: **NameError: name 'mak' is not defined**
