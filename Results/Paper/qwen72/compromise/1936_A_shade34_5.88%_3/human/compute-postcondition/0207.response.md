Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 3 elements.
3. `n` is greater than `len(pans)`.
4. `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
5. If the user input is `>`, `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
6. The output buffer has been flushed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the user input is `>`, `mak` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

2. **Determine the value of `pans[mak]`:**
   - If `mak` is 1, `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.
   - If `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.

3. **Determine the value of `pans[i]`:**
   - `i` is 2, so `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.

4. **Construct the output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

### Possible Outputs:
- **If the user input is `>`:**
  - `mak` is 1.
  - `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.
  - `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.
  - The output will be: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.

- **If the user input is not `>` (i.e., `=` or `<`):**
  - `mak` is 0.
  - `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
  - `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.
  - The output will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these indices.

If the user input is `>`:
Output: **? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2] (where pans[1] is the second element of the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**

If the user input is not `>` (i.e., `=` or `<`):
Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**

Since the user input is not specified, we need to cover both cases:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[2] pans[2] (where mak is 0 if the user input is not `>`, and 1 if the user input is `>`, and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
