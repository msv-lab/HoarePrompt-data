Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations, so `i` is now `n-1`.
- `n` is still greater than the length of `pans`, as it was initially.
- `pans` contains all indices `i` for which the user input was `=`, and if the user input was `<` at any iteration, it also contains the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the highest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
- `mak` is the highest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, or it remains 0 if no `<` was input.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, as specified in the loop.
