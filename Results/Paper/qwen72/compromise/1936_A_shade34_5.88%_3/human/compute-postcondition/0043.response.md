The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `_` has completed its iterations, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not `<` or `=`, and `s` is the new user input string.**
