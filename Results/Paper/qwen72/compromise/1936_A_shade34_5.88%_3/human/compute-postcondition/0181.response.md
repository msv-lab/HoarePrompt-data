Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` is 0 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, or remains 0 if no `<` is found.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `mak` and `mak2` depend on the user input `s`:
     - If `s` is `<` at any iteration, `mak` will be the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
     - If `s` is `<` at any iteration, `mak2` will also be the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
     - If no `<` is found in the user input, both `mak` and `mak2` will be 0.
   - `mak2` is printed twice in the statement.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `s` is `<` at any iteration:
     - `mak` will be the highest index for which `s` is `<`.
     - `mak2` will be the same highest index.
   - If no `<` is found in the user input:
     - `mak` will be 0.
     - `mak2` will be 0.

5. **Output:**
   - If `s` is `<` at any iteration, the output will be:
     ```
     ?, [highest index for which s is <], [highest index for which s is <], 1, [highest index for which s is <]
     ```
   - If no `<` is found in the user input, the output will be:
     ```
     ?, 0, 0, 1, 0
     ```

Since the exact user input `s` is not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical value of `mak` and `mak2`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **?, [mak], [mak2], 1, [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the highest index for which the user input was `<` if `<` is found, or 0 if no `<` is found)**
