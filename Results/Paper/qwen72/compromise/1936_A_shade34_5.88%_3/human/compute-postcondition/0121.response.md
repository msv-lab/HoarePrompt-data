Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 2, and `pans` is a list containing the value 2. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 2. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the value 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `pans`.
- Since `i` is 2, `pans` becomes `[2]`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` and the conditions related to `s` and `mak` remain as they were in the initial state, but `pans` is now updated to `[2]` regardless of the value of `s`.
