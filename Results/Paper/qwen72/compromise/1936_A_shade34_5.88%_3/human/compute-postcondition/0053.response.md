Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `_` has completed its iterations, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing the values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` if no `=` inputs were given.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is set to 0.
- The value of `mak2` is now also 0, since it is equal to `mak`.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `_`, and `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
