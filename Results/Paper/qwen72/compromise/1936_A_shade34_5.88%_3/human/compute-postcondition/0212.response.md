Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 4 elements.
   - `n` is greater than `len(pans)`.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - If the user input is `>`, `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` is either 0 or 2, depending on the user input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements, and it contains indices based on user input.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **If the user input is `>`:**
     - `mak` is 2.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])`.
     - This will print the value at index 2 of `pans` twice, followed by the value at index 3 of `pans` twice.
   - **If the user input is not `>`:**
     - `mak` is 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[3], pans[3])`.
     - This will print the value at index 0 of `pans` twice, followed by the value at index 3 of `pans` twice.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is `>`:
     - Output: **? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[2] is the value at index 2 of the list pans and pans[3] is the value at index 3 of the list pans)**
   - If the user input is not `>`:
     - Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[0] is the value at index 0 of the list pans and pans[3] is the value at index 3 of the list pans)**

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where mak is 2 if the user input is `>`, otherwise mak is 0, and pans[3] is the value at index 3 of the list pans)**
