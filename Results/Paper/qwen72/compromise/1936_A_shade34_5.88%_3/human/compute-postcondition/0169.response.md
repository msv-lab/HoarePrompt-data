Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `mak2` is the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise it remains 0.
   - `i` is 0, as stated in the initial state.
   - `mak2` is printed twice, so its value will be the same both times.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `'?'` is printed first.
   - `mak` is printed next. Based on the initial state, `mak` will be the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise it remains 0.
   - `mak2` is printed next. This is the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `i` is printed next, which is 0.
   - `mak2` is printed again, which is the highest index for which the user input was `<`.

Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `mak` and `mak2`. However, based on the given information, we can describe their values.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 0 [mak2] (where [mak] is the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, otherwise 0, and [mak2] is the highest index for which the user input was `<`)**
