Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string, which is not equal to `<`.**
