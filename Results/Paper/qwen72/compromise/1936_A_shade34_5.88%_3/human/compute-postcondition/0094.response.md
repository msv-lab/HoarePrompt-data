Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns `pans` to an empty list.
- The initial state specifies that `pans` must have at least `len(pans)` elements, but this is no longer relevant as `pans` is now an empty list.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`) and conditions (output buffer flushed) remain unchanged.
