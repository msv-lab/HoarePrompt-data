Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing the value 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.**

The value of `s` is updated to the input string provided by the user. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The conditions for `mak` and `pans` based on the value of `s` are still valid.
