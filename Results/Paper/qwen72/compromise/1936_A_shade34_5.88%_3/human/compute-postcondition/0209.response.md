Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
