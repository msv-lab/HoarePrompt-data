The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the user input. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected, and the precondition that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9 and 1 <= t <= 1000 remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: The function is expected to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
Output State: **The function is expected to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
