You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the total number of calls t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of three digits input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged. The loop will have printed 'STAIR' for each set of inputs where `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' for each set where `b` is the maximum value, and 'NONE' for all other cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. The function then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' for all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of inputs from the final iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` using the condition `if a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Equal Digits Condition**:
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `elif a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition**:
   - The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This is correct because a peak is defined as `a < b > c`, and if `b` is the maximum, it implies that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

5. **None Condition**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they are classified as "NONE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
