Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is 0.** 

The code initializes the variable `t` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `N-1`, `N` remains the same, and `cnt[a[j]]` is still incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.
