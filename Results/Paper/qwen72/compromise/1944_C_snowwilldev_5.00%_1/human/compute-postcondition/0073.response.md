Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1.
- Since `i` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
