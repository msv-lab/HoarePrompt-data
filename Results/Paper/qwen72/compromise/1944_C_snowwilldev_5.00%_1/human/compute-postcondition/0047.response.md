Output State: **`N` remains the same and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is 1, and the current value of `cnt[0]` is 1.** 

The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so `t` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
