Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, meaning it will return 0 for any key that is not already in the dictionary.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.
   - `tc` is incremented by 1.
   - `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.
   - The current value of `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2.
   - `cnt[i]` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 0 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` is not modified in the code snippet provided.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
