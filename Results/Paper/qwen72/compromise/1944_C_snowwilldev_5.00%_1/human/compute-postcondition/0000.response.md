The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `tc` must start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `tc` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
