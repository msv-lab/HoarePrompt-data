Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `N` is greater than 2, and `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `t` remains 1. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking, and `t` remains 1.***
