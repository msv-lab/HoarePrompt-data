Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `N` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with `int`, meaning it will return 0 for any key that is not yet in the dictionary.
- `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. This means that for each element in the list `a`, the corresponding count in `cnt` is increased by 1.
- `tc` is incremented by 1, and `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
2. **Variable `cnt`**: `cnt` is a defaultdict that keeps track of the counts of elements in the list `a`. However, the value of `cnt[i]` (where `i` is 1) is not directly provided in the initial state.
3. **Variable `t`**: The value of `t` depends on `cnt[i]`. If `cnt[1]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0. However, the value of `t` is not printed in the code snippet.
4. **Variable `tc`**: `tc` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`. This condition is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.

Output: **1**
