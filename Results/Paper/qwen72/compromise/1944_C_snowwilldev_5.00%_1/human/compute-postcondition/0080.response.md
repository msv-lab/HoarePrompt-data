Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 1, and the value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
