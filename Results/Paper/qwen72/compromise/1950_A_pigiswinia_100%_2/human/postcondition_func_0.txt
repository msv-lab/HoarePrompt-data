The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`) from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last test case, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`.
