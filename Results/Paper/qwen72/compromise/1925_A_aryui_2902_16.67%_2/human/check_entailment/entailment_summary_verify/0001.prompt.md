You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) from user input and returns a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - The constructed string is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times. This means the string will be of length `k * n`.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `abcbac`.

   - **Subsequence Check:**
     - To ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, we need to check if every combination of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets can be found in `s`.
     - The constructed string `s` will have all possible combinations of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets as subsequences because it repeats the first `k` alphabets `n` times. This ensures that any sequence of `n` characters can be found by skipping over the other characters.

   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, which is the smallest possible length to ensure that all combinations of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets are subsequences.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `abcbac` has a length of 6, which is the smallest length that can contain all 9 possible subsequences of length 2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution constructs a string `s` that meets the requirements of the problem.
   - The string `s` is of the smallest possible length and contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
