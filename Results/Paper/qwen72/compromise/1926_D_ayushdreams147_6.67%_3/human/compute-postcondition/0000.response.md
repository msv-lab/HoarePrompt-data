Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0.**

The variable `res` is initialized to 0, while the values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged. The output state reflects this initialization and retains the initial conditions for `n` and `a`.
