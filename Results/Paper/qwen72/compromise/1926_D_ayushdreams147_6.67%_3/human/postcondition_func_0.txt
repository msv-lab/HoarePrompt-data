The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`). The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the complement of each integer in `a` and updates the result `res` accordingly. After the function concludes, `res` contains the count of unique integers in `a` based on their complements.
