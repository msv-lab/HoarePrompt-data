Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of "U" (facing-up) coins using `s.count('U')`.
   - The function returns "YES" if the number of "U" coins is odd and "NO" if it is even.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game's outcome is determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move and can force Bob to lose.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have the last move and can force Alice to lose.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins correctly by returning "NO" (since the player who starts with no facing-up coins loses).
   - The function also handles the case where there is only one coin left correctly by returning "NO" (since the player who starts with one coin left loses).

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
