Reasoning: 

The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` actually handles the case where there are no facing-up coins correctly, even though it might not be immediately obvious. Let's break it down:

1. **Problem Description and Game Logic**:
   - The game ends if there are no facing-up coins left, and the player whose turn it is loses.
   - The function `func_1` checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
   - If `num_up` is odd, Alice will win because she will always have a move available, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
   - If `num_up` is even, Bob will win because he will always have a move available, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

2. **Handling No Facing-Up Coins**:
   - If there are no facing-up coins (`num_up == 0`), the function will return 'NO' because 0 is even.
   - According to the problem description, if there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses. Since Alice goes first, she will lose if there are no facing-up coins initially.
   - Therefore, returning 'NO' in the case where `num_up == 0` is correct because it means Alice loses.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     DDDDD
     ```
     - The function `func_1` will count 0 'U' coins.
     - Since 0 is even, the function will return 'NO'.
     - This is the correct output because Alice loses immediately since there are no facing-up coins to choose from.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any input where the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
   - For any input where the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will win because he can always make a move, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not handle the case where there are no facing-up coins correctly.

Final: **True**
