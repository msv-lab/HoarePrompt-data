Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is False, `lst[x]` is now non-empty but has one less element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `x` is assigned the value of `y`.
- `_` remains `x - 2`, which is now `y - 2`.
- `a` and `b` remain input integers.
- `lst[a]` remains a list that includes `b` `x - 1` times.
- `lst[b]` remains a list that includes `a` `x - 1` times.
- `s` remains False.
- `lst[x]` (which is now `lst[y]`) remains non-empty but has one less element.
- `y` remains the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation.
- `lst[y]` is not an empty list.
