Output State: **`x` is the last non-empty `y` value from the list `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `lst[x]` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `_` remains unchanged, `s` is now the opposite of its previous value.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`.
- The previous value of `y` was the second last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before the loop terminated. After this code execution, `y` now holds the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`.
- The list `lst[x]` is still not empty, as it was stated that `x` is the last non-empty `y` value from the list `lst[x]` before the loop terminated.
- The list `lst[y]` is not affected and remains not empty.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The variable `s` is now the opposite of its previous value.
