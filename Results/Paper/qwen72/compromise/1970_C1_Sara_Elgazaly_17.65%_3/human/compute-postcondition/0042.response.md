The variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `lst[x]` being non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is now non-empty but has one less element. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[x]` must still be non-empty.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is False, `lst[x]` is now non-empty but has two less elements, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
