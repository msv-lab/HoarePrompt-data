test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. The first element of each tuple is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The length of the list of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
