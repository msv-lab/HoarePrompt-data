t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the outcomes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
