#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. The first element of each tuple is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The length of the list of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the last element of `numbers` (if the list has more than one element), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. The input list `numbers` must contain at least one integer. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the GCD of all elements in `numbers` is returned, and the input list `numbers` remains unchanged.
