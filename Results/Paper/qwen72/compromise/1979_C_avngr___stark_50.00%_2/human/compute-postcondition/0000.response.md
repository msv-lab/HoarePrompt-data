Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. The first element of each tuple is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The length of the list of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `hcf = numbers[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `numbers` to the variable `hcf`.
- The initial state describes the structure and constraints of `test_cases`, but does not mention `numbers`. Therefore, `numbers` must be a list that is already defined in the context.
- The values of `test_cases` and its constraints remain unchanged.
- The variable `hcf` now holds the value of the first element in `numbers`.
