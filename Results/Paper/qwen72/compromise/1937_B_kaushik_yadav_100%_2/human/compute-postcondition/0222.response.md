The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a grid. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid's configuration.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a grid. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of columns in a 2 \times n grid, and the grid contains cells with values 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid's configuration.**
