The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be changed to ensure the loop executes. The state remains as provided, with the additional confirmation that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1.**
