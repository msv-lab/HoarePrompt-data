Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, and `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is set to 2 or 3. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. If `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', `counter` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
