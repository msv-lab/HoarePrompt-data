Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is now a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found, and `work` is True. Additionally, the current value of `i` is 0, and the character at position `i` in `b` is less than the character at position `i + 1` in `a`.**
