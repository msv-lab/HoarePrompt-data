Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is 2 if `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`, and `ans` is updated to include the second character of `b` if `work` is True or False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
