Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, `counter` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
