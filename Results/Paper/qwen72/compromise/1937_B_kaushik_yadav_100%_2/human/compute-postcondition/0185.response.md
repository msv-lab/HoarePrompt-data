Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 3 if `i + 1 < len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found, `work` is False, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`.**
