Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b` followed by the second character of `b` and the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is extended by the third character of `b`, `i` remains 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 3 and `work` remains False.***
