Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first two characters of `a` if `work` is True and the first character of `b` if `work` is False, `i` is 2 if `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`, otherwise, if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the second character of `b` if `work` is True, and to include the second character of `b` if `work` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `len(a)` must be greater than 1.**
