### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses a variable `work` to decide whether the grasshopper should move right in the top row or switch to the bottom row.
   - The loop iterates through the indices of the strings `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If the loop reaches the end of the string `a`, it appends the last character from `b` to `ans`.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans` and moves to the next index.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the indices of the strings `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If the next character in `a` is the same as the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If the characters differ in a way that does not allow the counter to increment, it breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program ensures that the grasshopper always takes the smallest possible value at each step, and switches to the bottom row only when necessary.
- The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. It correctly identifies the points where the grasshopper can switch between the top and bottom rows and counts the valid paths accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
