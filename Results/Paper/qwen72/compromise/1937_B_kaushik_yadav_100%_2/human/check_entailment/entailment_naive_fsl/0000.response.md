Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved by multiple paths, but not all of them are counted correctly. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0010
0011
```

The lexicographically smallest string is `00101`. There are two paths that yield this string:
1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)
2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

However, the program outputs:
```
00101
1
```

The string is correct, but the number of paths is incorrect. The program only counts one path, while there are actually two paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. This indicates that the program does not correctly count all possible paths that can achieve the smallest string.
