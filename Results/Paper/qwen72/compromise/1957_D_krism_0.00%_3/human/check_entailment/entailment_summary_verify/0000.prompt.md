You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in the list and stores these values in a list `prefix`. It then initializes two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists with two elements (0 and 0). The function increments the first element of each sublist in `pre` by 1. For each element in `prefix` (excluding the first element), the function updates the `suf` list based on the bit positions of the current element. It calculates a final result `ans` by summing up specific products derived from the `pre` and `suf` lists, and prints this result. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\) and \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of tuples by iterating through the array and using prefix XOR values, but the logic used to count the tuples is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

2. **Incorrect Use of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are used to count the number of prefix and suffix values with a specific bit set or unset, but the way these arrays are updated and used does not correctly reflect the required condition.

3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The bitwise operations and the way the `pre` and `suf` arrays are updated do not align with the problem's requirement to find tuples where the XOR condition holds.

**Example Case:**

For the input:
```
3
3
6 2 4
1
3
5
7 3 7 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
4
0
16
```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output for these test cases. The program's logic for counting the tuples is incorrect, and it does not correctly handle the XOR conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
