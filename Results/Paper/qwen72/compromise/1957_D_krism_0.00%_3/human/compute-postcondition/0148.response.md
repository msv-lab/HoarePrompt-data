Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pre[2][1]` is now `pre[2][1] + 1`.
