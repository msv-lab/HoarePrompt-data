Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to each index, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0].** 

The code initializes a new list `pre` with 32 sublists, each containing two zeros. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `prefix` remain unchanged.
