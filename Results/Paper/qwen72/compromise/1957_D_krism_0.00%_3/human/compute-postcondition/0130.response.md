Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `y.bit_length() - 1`.
- `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, so `k` is now the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.
