The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `32`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 31
- `n` is greater than 0
- `cur` is equal to `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- The range `32` remains constant and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 31, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2**
