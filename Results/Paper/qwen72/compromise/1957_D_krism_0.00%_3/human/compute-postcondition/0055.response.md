The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 30 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to 29, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 29, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 32**
