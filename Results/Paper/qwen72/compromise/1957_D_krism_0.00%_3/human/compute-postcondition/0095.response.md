The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range limit `32`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `32`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 2. If `c >> j & 1` is true, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**
