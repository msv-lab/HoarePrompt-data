Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, so it is now `pre[j][1] + 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `y`, `k`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `suf[j][1]` is not affected by the given code snippet, so it remains the same.
- The value of `pre[j][0]` is not affected by the given code snippet, so it remains the same.
- The value of `suf[j][0]` is not affected by the given code snippet, so it remains the same.
