Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `v` is the first integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and `v ^ 0` (which is `v`).**

Explanation:
- `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix` (which is 0) to the list `prefix`.
- Since `prefix` initially contains only the integer 0, `prefix[-1]` is 0.
- The bitwise XOR of any integer `v` with 0 is `v` itself.
- Therefore, `prefix` now contains the integers 0 and `v`.
- The values of `arr`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged.
