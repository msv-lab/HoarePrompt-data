Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` from 0 to 31, where `k` is the bit length of each `arr[i]` minus 1 for `i` from 0 to 30. `y` is equal to `arr[30]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[30]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31 in `c` (which is `prefix[31]`), if the bit at position `j` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 31 iterations:
- The variable `i` is 31, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variable `n` remains 31, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the products of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0]` and `pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position `k` from 0 to 31, where `k` is the bit length of each element in `arr` minus 1, for all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[30]`.
- The variable `y` is the value of `arr[30]`, which is the last element processed in the loop.
- The variable `k` is the bit length of `arr[30]` minus 1, reflecting the highest bit position of the last element processed.
- The variable `c` is `prefix[31]`, which is the prefix value corresponding to the last iteration.
- The variable `j` is 31, as it is the last bit position checked in the inner loop.
- For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31 in `c` (which is `prefix[31]`), if the bit at position `j` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. This means that the `pre` and `suf` arrays have been updated to reflect the bit counts of all elements in `prefix` from `prefix[0]` to `prefix[31]`.
