### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Handling the Case When `n` is 1:**
   - If `n` is 1, Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`. The program correctly prints `a` in this case.

3. **Handling the Case When `n` is Greater Than 1:**
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
       - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
       - `n % 2` gives the number of yogurts that cannot form a pair and must be bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that the maximum number of pairs are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - This formula is mathematically sound and covers all possible values of `n` within the given constraints.

6. **Annotated Code Verification:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly processes each test case.
   - The state of the program is accurately described after each iteration of the loop.
   - The final state of the program is as expected, with the correct minimum cost printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
