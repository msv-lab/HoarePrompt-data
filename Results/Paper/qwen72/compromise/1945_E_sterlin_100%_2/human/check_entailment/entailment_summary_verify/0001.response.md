Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` using at most 2 swaps so that a binary search can find the number `x` at the correct position.
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly described in the problem statement.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program needs to handle multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is a key part of the solution, but it is not implemented in the provided code.
   - The algorithm should initialize `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`, and then iteratively update `m` as the midpoint, adjusting `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `p[m]` with `x`.

4. **Swapping Operations**:
   - The program needs to determine the positions of `x` in the permutation and the positions of the elements that need to be swapped to achieve the correct order for binary search.
   - This logic is missing from the provided code.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program consists of several functions for input handling:
     - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer.
     - `func_2()`: Reads and maps a list of integers.
     - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a list of integers.
     - `func_4()`: Reads a single line of input.
     - `func_5()`: Splits a line of input into a list of strings.
   - These functions are useful for reading input, but they do not solve the problem.
   - The program lacks the main logic to:
     - Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
     - Determine the necessary swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search.
     - Perform the binary search and output the required swaps.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It only provides input handling functions and does not implement the binary search algorithm or the logic to perform the necessary swaps.

Final: **False**
