It seems there might be a misunderstanding or an incomplete function definition provided. The problem description and the function definition do not match. The problem description suggests a function that deals with permutations and binary search, but the provided function definition `def ii():` does not align with this problem. Could you please provide the correct function definition that matches the problem description? For example, it might look something like this:

```python
def rearrange_for_binary_search(n, x, p):
```

Once I have the correct function definition, I can help you extract the precondition.
