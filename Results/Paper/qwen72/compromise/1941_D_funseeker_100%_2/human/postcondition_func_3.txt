The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but relies on the output of `func_3` to obtain three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. It then performs a series of operations based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1` for `m` iterations. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a set of unique integers derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or just `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. The function prints the length of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`. The function does not return any value.
