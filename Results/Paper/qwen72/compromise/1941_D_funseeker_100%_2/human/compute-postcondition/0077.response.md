To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that modify the set `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
- If `0` is in the original `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
- `m` is 0 (though `m` is not used in the print statement).
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial `ans` Set**:
   - The set `ans` is initially populated based on the values of `q` in the original `ans`, `r`, and `n`, and the condition `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - If `c` is '1', `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.

2. **Modification of `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in the original `ans`, it is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.

3. **Printing the Sorted `ans`**:
   - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the elements of the set `ans` in sorted order.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `c` is '0' or '?'**:
  - Suppose `ans` initially contains `{1, 2, 3}` and `r` is 1, `n` is 5.
  - For each `q` in `{1, 2, 3}`:
    - `(1 + 1) % 5 = 2`
    - `(1 - 1) % 5 = 0`
    - `(2 + 1) % 5 = 3`
    - `(2 - 1) % 5 = 1`
    - `(3 + 1) % 5 = 4`
    - `(3 - 1) % 5 = 2`
  - `ans` becomes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
  - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` (5) is added.
  - `ans` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
  - The sorted `ans` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

- **Scenario 2: `c` is '1'**:
  - Suppose `ans` initially contains `{1, 2, 3}` and `r` is 1, `n` is 5.
  - For each `q` in `{1, 2, 3}`:
    - `(1 - 1) % 5 = 0`
    - `(2 - 1) % 5 = 1`
    - `(3 - 1) % 5 = 2`
  - `ans` becomes `{0, 1, 2}`.
  - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` (5) is added.
  - `ans` becomes `{1, 2, 5}`.
  - The sorted `ans` is `[1, 2, 5]`.

### General Case:
- The final set `ans` will contain unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or unique values of `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'.
- If `0` is in the original `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
- The `print` statement will output the sorted elements of the final `ans`.

### Output:
Output: **sorted(ans) (where `ans` is the set of unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or unique values of `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1', with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` is in the original `ans`)**

This output format provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the initial state and the operations described.
