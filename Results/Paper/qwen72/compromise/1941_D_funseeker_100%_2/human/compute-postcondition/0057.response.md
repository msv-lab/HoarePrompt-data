The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` already contains the value `(q + r) % n`. The current value of `c` is '1' or '?'. 

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. The value `(q - r) % n` is calculated.
2. This value is added to the set `temp`.

The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition to `temp`.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The current value of `c` is '1' or '?'.**
