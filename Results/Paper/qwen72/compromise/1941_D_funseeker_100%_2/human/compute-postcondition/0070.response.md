Output State: **`ans` is an empty set, `temp` is an empty set, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `m` is greater than the final value of `_`, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans = temp` assigns the current value of `temp` to `ans`. Since `temp` is an empty set, `ans` also becomes an empty set. The states of the other variables (`_`, `m`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
