The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` assigns the first and second elements of the string returned by `func_1()` to the variables `r` and `c`, respectively. The initial state specifies that `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `r` is an integer. After executing this code, `r` and `c` are updated with the values from `func_1()`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `temp` is a set containing the same values as the updated `ans`.**
