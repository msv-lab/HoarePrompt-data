Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the second element of `ans`. `temp` now contains the value `(q + r) % n` in addition to its previous values.**

Explanation:
- The value `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
- `q` is the second element of `ans`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `c` is '1' or '?' is still valid, so `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- The new value `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`, making it a set with at least these two values.
