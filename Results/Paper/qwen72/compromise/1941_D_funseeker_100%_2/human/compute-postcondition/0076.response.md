To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - If `0` is in the original `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Set Operations**:
   - The set `ans` is initially populated based on the values of `q` in the original `ans` and the value of `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `ans` will contain all unique values of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - If `c` is '1', `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.

3. **Handling the Special Case**:
   - If `0` is in the original `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`.

4. **Determining the Length of `ans`**:
   - The length of `ans` will depend on the initial values of `ans`, `r`, and `n`, as well as the value of `c`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

- **If `c` is '0' or '?'**:
  - `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
  - If `0` is in the original `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
  - The length of `ans` will be the number of unique values resulting from these operations.

- **If `c` is '1'**:
  - `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
  - If `0` is in the original `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
  - The length of `ans` will be the number of unique values resulting from these operations.

Since the exact values of `ans`, `r`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the operations and conditions given.

**Final Output**:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after the specified operations have been applied.
Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set resulting from the operations described in the initial state)**
