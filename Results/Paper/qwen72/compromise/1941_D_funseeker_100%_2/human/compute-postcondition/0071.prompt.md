Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. `temp` is a set containing the same values as the updated `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `temp` is a set containing all the values that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is an empty set, `temp` is an empty set, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `m` is greater than the final value of `_`, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
