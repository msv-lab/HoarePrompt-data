Postcondition: ***`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', the value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged.***
