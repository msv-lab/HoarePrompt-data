Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the variable `r` to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `c`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `c` is still the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space.
