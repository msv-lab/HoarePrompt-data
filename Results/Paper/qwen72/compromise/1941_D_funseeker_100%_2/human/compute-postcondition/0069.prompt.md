Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `_` is incremented by 1, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is now an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also includes the new element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next element in `ans` after the current `q`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` added to it. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` added to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
