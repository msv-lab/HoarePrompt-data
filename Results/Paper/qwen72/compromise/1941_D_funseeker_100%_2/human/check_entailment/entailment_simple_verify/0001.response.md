### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and processes it to extract integers and strings as required.
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `func_3()` splits the result of `func_1()` by spaces and converts each element to an integer, returning a list.
   - `func_4()` is the main function that processes each test case.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each function call, and the input handling is accurate.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The initial state of `ans` is correctly set to `{x}`.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then iterates over the current set of possible positions `ans`.
   - For each position `q`:
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all possible positions for the current throw, it updates `ans` to `temp`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the state of `ans` and `temp` at each step. The program correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, and the '?' direction is handled by considering both possibilities.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the position `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because in a circular arrangement, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the state of `ans` after handling the edge case. The program correctly updates the set to reflect the circular nature of the game.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible positions.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the output process. The program prints the correct number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` are correctly implemented to handle the input as specified. The main function `func_4()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case accordingly.
- **Position Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the new positions for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws using the modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the game. The handling of the '?' direction is also correct, as it considers both possible directions.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where position `0` is equivalent to position `n` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of possible positions, ensuring that all positions are unique and in increasing order.

### Conclusion:

The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
