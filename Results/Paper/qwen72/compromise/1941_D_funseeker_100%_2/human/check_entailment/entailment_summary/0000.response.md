Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing newline characters. This function is used to read the inputs for the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`**:
   - The function `func_4` is the core of the program. It processes each test case by:
     - Reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
     - Initializing a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
     - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1`.
     - Depending on the direction `c`:
       - If `c` is '0' or '?', it calculates the new position by moving `r` steps clockwise and adds the result to a temporary set `temp`.
       - If `c` is '1' or '?', it calculates the new position by moving `r` steps counterclockwise and adds the result to `temp`.
     - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` with the contents of `temp`.
     - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set to handle the case where the ball could be with player `n` (since player `0` does not exist).
     - Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', meaning the throw could have been in either direction.
   - The program ensures that the player numbers are within the valid range `[1, n]` by using modulo operations and adjusting for the case where the result is `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs the number of possible players and the sorted list of these players.

4. **Overall Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the provided functions.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the main logic in `func_4` is implemented to meet the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
