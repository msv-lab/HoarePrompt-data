Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the last element is set to `k`, `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is set to `a[l] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is set to `l - 1`, `q2` is set to `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is set to `l + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the second element is set to `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is set to `a[l] % m * a[l + 1] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 1`, and `q2` is set to `l + 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is set to `l - 2`, and `q2` is set to `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is set to `l + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is set to `k`, and the second element is set to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise it is set to `k * a[q1] % m`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is -1, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is set to `k`, and the second element of `y` is set to `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', the second element of `y` is set to `k * a[q2] % m`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i]` is not 'R', the second element of `y` is set to `k * a[q1] % m`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
