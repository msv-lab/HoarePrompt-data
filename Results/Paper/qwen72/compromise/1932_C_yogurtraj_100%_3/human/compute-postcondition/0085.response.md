To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `t` is a user input string.
   - `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the modulo operation `k % m` after each iteration of the loop.
   - `k` is the final value of the modulo operation `k % m` after all iterations of the loop.
   - `q1` and `q2` are indices that have been updated according to the rules in the loop based on the characters in `t` and the initial values of `q1` and `q2`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times.
   - In each iteration, some operations are performed on `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the characters in `t`.
   - The result of `k % m` is appended to the list `y` after each iteration.

3. **Output of `print(*y)`:**
   - The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces.
   - Each element in `y` is the result of `k % m` after each iteration of the loop.

Since the exact values of `a`, `t`, `q1`, `q2`, and the operations within the loop are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **[y[0] y[1] ... y[n-1]] (where each y[i] is the result of k % m after the i-th iteration of the loop, and k is updated based on the characters in the string t and the initial values of q1 and q2)**

This means the output will be a sequence of `n` integers, each representing the result of the modulo operation `k % m` after each iteration of the loop, with `k` being updated according to the rules specified in the loop based on the characters in `t` and the initial values of `q1` and `q2`.
