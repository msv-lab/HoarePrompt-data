Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a program that handles multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, but their final values depend on the specific characters in `t` and the length of `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is -1, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the modulo operation `k % m` after each iteration of the loop, and `k` is the final value of the modulo operation `k % m` after all iterations of the loop. `q1` and `q2` are indices that have been updated according to the rules in the loop based on the characters in `t` and the initial values of `q1` and `q2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 1 and updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is -1, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the loop's computation, and `k` is the final value after all iterations of the loop. `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the number of 'R' and 'L' characters encountered in the string `t` during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
