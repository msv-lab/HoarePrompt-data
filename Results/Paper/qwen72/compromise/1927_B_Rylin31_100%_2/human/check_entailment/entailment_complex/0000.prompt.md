Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is `t - 1`, `l` is an input integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements corresponding to the indices in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from input, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the letter is determined by the current value in a list `s` of length `l` initialized to zeros. The value in `s` at the index specified by each integer in `array` is incremented after each mapping. The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged, and the program state includes the printed strings for all test cases.
