The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`.

- `array` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `array` is `m`, which is the number of integers provided in the input.
- Each element in `array` is greater than 0, as per the initial state conditions.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the cumulative sum of `s[j]` at each position in `array`, starting from 97 (ASCII value of 'a').**
