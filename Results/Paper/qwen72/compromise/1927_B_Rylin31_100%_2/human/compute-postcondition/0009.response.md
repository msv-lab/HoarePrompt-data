The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by the value of `s[j]` plus 97, which is the ASCII value for 'a'. Given that `s[j]` is 1 (since `s[j]` is the only element in `s` that is 1, and all others are 0), the character added to `ans` is `chr(1 + 97)`, which is 'b'. Therefore, the string `ans` changes from 'a' to 'ab'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where `s[j]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `array` must have at least two elements, each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the second element in `array`, `ans` is the string 'ab'**.
