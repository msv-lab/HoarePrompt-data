Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` has `m` elements (where `m` is the length of `array`), each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the cumulative sum of `s[j]` at each position in `array`, starting from 97 (ASCII value of 'a')**

Explanation: The code initializes `s` to a list of `l` integers, where each integer is 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
