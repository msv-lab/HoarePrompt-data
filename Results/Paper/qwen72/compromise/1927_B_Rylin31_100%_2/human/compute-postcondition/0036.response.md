Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers read from input, `j` is the last element in the new `array`, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ''` sets the variable `ans` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
