Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is now 3, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 2, `j` is the third element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` repeated three times.**
