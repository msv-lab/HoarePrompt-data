Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are unchanged, but the sorted lists for each test case have been printed to the console. **
