The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the list `a` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which should be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
