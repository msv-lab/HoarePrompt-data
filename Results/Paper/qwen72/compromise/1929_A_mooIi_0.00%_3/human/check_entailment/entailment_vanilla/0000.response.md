Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
   - The formula for beauty is: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The largest differences are obtained by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.
   - However, the given program does not calculate the beauty; it simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array and then prints the sorted elements as strings.
   - The program does not compute the beauty of the array, which is the required output.

4. **Correct Output**:
   - The correct output should be the maximum beauty of the array, not the sorted array itself.
   - The maximum beauty can be computed as follows:
     - Sort the array.
     - Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not solve the problem as described. It only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
