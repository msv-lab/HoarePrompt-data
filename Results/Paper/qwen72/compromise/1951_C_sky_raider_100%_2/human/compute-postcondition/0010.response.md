Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by the value of `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` now holds the value of `s`.
