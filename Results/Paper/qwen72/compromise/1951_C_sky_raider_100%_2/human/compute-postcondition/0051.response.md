The code snippet `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `l` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
