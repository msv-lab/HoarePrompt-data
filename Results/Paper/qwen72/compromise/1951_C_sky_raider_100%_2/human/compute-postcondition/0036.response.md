The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is `k - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`**
