Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, and `c` is the sum of `0 * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is recalculated using the new value of `s` (which is now 0), making `c` equal to the sum of `0 * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Since multiplying by 0 results in 0, `c` is effectively 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
