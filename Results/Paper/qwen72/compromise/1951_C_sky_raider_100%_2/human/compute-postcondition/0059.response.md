Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is the third integer read from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k`.
