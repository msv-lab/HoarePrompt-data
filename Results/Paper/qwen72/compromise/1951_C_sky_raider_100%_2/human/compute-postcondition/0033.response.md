Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)`.
- Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`.
- `t` is 0, so `l[i] + t` simplifies to `l[0]`.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- Therefore, `c` is updated to `s * l[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
