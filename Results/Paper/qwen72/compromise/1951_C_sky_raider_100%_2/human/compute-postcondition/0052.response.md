Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c`) retain their initial values or expressions.
- The value of `c` is recalculated using the updated value of `t` (which is now 0), so `c` is the sum of `s * l[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
