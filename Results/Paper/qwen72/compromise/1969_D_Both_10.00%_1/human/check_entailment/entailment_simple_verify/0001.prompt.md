You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `putin()` to read input, which is not a standard Python function. Typically, `input()` is used to read input in Python. This is a critical issue as the program will not run as expected with the current input handling.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a single integer from the input. It is used to read the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, as well as the arrays `a` and `b`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is supposed to calculate Alice's profit. However, the logic in this function is flawed:
   - It initializes `sub_summ` to 0.
   - It iterates over `sec_arr` and adds the first element of each tuple to `sub_summ`. This is incorrect because `sec_arr` is not defined in the function, and it should be the array `a` or `b` depending on the context.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if the sum is non-negative. This is also incorrect because `main_ar` is not defined in the function, and the logic does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should choose items that maximize her profit, which is `b_i - a_i`.
   - Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each item (`b_i - a_i`), sort these profits in descending order, and then sum the first `n - k` items (since Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest profit).

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
   - Read the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - Calculate the profit for each item (`b_i - a_i`).
   - Sort the profits in descending order.
   - Sum the first `n - k` items to get Alice's profit.

Given the issues in the input handling and the logic in `func_3`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
