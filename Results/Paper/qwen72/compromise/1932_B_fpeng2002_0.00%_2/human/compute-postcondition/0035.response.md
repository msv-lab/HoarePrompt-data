Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
