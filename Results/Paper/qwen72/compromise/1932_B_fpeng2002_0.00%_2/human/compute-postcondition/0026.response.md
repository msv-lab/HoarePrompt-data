Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
   - `num_tests` is `t - 2`, which means `num_tests` is in the range 0 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 998.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

2. **Understanding `start_year`:**
   - The initial value of `start_year` is not explicitly given, but it is described as the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
   - This implies that `start_year` is calculated based on the last element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[x]` where `x = len(nums) - 1`).

3. **Calculation of `start_year`:**
   - To find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`, we need to know the previous `start_year`.
   - Since the previous `start_year` is not provided, we can only describe the calculation in terms of the last element of `nums`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(start_year)` statement will print the value of `start_year`.

Given the initial state and the lack of a specific previous `start_year`, the output will be described in terms of the last element of `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of nums[len(nums) - 1] that is greater than the previous start_year)**
