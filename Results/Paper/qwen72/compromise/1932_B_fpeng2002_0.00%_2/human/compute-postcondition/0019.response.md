To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element, and `x` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, so `num_tests` can range from 0 to 998.
- `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
- `start_year` is 0.

For the loop to execute:
- `nums` must have at least one element.
- `x` must be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Since `x` is set to 0 by the `range(0, len(nums))` function, and `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is 0**
