Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.
- The calculation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `nums[0]` if `start_year` is 0.
- All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
