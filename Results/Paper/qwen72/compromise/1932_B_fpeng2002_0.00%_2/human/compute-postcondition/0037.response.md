Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `start_year` is calculated using the formula: `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, which ensures that `start_year` is the next multiple of `nums[2]` after `start_year + 1`.
