The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
