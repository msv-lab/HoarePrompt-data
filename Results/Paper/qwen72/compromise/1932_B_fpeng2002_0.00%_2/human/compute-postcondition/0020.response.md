Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1. This is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which simplifies to `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]` since `start_year` is 0 and `x` is 0.
- The expression `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]` simplifies to `((1 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
- If `nums[0]` is 1, `start_year` becomes 1.
- If `nums[0]` is greater than 1, `start_year` becomes the next multiple of `nums[0]` after 1, which is `nums[0]`.
- The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`, and the condition `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0 remain unchanged.
