The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `x`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least one element, which it does. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1, and `nums` will still have at least one element.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.**
