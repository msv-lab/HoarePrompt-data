The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is 0, and `nums` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.

For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element, and `x` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is 0**
