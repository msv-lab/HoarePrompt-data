To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `tc` remains 1.
- `n` remains an integer input by the user.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).
- `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` and `j` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(20):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head only involves the variable `j`.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to 19 (inclusive).

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

### Updated State:
- `j` is now 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` and `j` is 1.**
