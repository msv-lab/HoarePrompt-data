Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the values of the last test case input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`. The loop has printed the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set by the user and controls the number of test cases.
- `tc` is incremented with each iteration of the outer loop and will be `t-1` after the loop completes.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from user input.
- `i` is calculated as the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\) for each test case.
- `ans` is constructed for each test case as described, and the length and elements of `ans` are printed for each test case.
- After the loop completes, the final values of `n`, `k`, and `i` correspond to the last test case processed.
