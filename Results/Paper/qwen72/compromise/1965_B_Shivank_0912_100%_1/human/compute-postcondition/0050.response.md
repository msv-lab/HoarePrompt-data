The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, and the loop condition is based on `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `tc`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `tc` remains 1.
- `n` remains an integer input by the user.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).
- `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` concatenated with all powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `tc` must be incremented to 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` concatenated with all powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\)**.
