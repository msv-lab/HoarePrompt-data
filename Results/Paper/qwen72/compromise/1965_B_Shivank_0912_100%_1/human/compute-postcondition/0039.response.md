The code appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 0, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, the value 1 is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
