Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
