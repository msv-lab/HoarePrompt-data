Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a list `ans` that contains specific values derived from `k` and all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) except one. It then prints the length of this list followed by its elements. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes `t` remaining as the initial input, `tc` being `t-1`, `n` and `k` holding the values of the last test case, and `i` being the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\). **
