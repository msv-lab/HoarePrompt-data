You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: `i` is `t - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - n` (or `k` is `0` if the loop breaks), `b` is the value after `n` iterations of `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `n` iterations of `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative result of `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the cumulative result of `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, `sp` is `sp + sum(a[p[s] - 1] for _ in range(n))`, `bp` is `bp + sum(a[p[b] - 1] for _ in range(n))`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, and if `bm` is less than `sm`, `bm` is strictly less than `sm`. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, then `bm` is equal to `sm`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in the array `a`.

4. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p`.
   - It then updates their scores by adding the corresponding values from the array `a`.

5. **Score Update Logic:**
   - The program uses a loop to simulate the game turns and updates the scores for both players.
   - However, the logic for updating the scores is incorrect. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines are not necessary and do not follow the rules of the game. The correct way to update the scores is simply to add the value at the current position in the array `a` to the current score.

6. **Final Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Score Calculation:**
  - `bodya_score` and `sasha_score` are initialized with the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.
- **Score Update Loop:**
  - The loop runs `k-1` times (since the initial score is already added).
  - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated according to the permutation `p`.
  - The scores are updated by adding the value at the new position in the array `a`.
- **Final Score Comparison:**
  - After the loop, the scores are compared, and the result is printed.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score update loop.
- The corrected program follows the rules of the game correctly and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is provided above.)
