### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is incorrect because it assumes the player will stay at the same position for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, decrementing `k` each time.
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively, which is correct for moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated using the formula `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This is incorrect because it does not simulate the game correctly. The formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` does not reflect the actual game rules, which state that the player either stays or moves to `p_x` and adds `a_x` to their score.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared to determine the winner.
   - The function prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The use of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is not correct. The game rules state that the player either stays or moves to `p_x` and adds `a_x` to their score. The current implementation does not correctly simulate this behavior.
- **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs for `n` iterations, which is not necessary. The game lasts for `k` turns, and the loop should run for `k` iterations.
- **Score Accumulation**: The scores `bm` and `sm` should be accumulated by adding `a_x` for each move, not by using the `max` function.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
