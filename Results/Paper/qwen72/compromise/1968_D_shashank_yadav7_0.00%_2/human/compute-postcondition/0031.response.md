Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is incremented by the value at index `b` in the list `a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
