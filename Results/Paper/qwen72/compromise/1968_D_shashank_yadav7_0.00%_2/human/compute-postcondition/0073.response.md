The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`**
