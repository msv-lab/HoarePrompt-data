The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**
