Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers.**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `p`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
