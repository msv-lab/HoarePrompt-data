Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- The previous value of `bm` is `bm`.
- The value of `a[b] * k + bp` is calculated as `a[p[b] - 1] * -2 + bp`.
- The new value of `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -2 + bp)`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged or are updated as previously described in the initial state.
