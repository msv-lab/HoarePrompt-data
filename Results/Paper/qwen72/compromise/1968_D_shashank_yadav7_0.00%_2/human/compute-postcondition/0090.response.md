Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * -3 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`.**
