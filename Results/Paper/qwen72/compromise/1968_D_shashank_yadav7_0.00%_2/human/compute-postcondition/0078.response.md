Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `i`, `n`, and `k` are still valid.
- The updates to `b`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are still valid as they were not affected by the code snippet.
