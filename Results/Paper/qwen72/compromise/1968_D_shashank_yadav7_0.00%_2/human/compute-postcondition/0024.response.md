Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)`. If `k` is 0, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * -1 + max(a[b] * -1, bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * -1 + max(a[s] * -1, sp)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
