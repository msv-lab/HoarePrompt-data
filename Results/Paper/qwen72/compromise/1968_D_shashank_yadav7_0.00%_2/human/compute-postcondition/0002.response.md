Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains the same for `t` and `i`. The code snippet takes four integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. Therefore, these variables are now assigned specific integer values provided by the input.
