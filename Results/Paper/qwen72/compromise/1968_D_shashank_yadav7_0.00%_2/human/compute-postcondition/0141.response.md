Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + 2 * a[b]`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. If `k` was 0, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- All other variables and conditions mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
