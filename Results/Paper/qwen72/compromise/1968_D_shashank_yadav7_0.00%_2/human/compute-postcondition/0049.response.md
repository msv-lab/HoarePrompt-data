Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer minus `n`.
- `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` list is applied `n` times).
- `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` list is applied `n` times).
- `p` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
- `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
- `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations.
- `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly.
- The condition `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm` is given, but it does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **Draw**
