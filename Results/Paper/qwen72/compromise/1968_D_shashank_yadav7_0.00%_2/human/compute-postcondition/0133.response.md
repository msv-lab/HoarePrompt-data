Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`. If `k` was 0 before the if statement, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code snippet `bp += a[b]` updates the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. Since `bp` was already updated to `bp + a[b]` in the initial state, the new value of `bp` becomes `bp + a[b] + a[b]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. If `k` was 0 before the if statement, we still break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
