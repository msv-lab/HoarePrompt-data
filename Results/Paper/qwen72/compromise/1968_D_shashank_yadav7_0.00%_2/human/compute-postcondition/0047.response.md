Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `i` is `n - 1`.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `k` is an input integer minus `n`.
5. `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times).
6. `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times).
7. `p` is a list of integers.
8. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
9. `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
10. `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
11. `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations.
12. `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.
13. `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'Sasha'`.

### Output:
Output: **Sasha**
