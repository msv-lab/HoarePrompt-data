Output State: **`i` is `n - 1` (or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0), `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `-(n - 1)` (or 0 if the loop breaks), `b` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (or until `k` reaches 0 and the loop breaks):

- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` (or the loop will break before reaching `n - 1` if `k` becomes 0).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` will be `-(n - 1)` (or 0 if the loop breaks).
- The value of `b` will be the result of applying `p[b] - 1` `n - 1` times.
- The value of `s` will be the result of applying `p[s] - 1` `n - 1` times.
- The value of `bm` will be the cumulative sum of the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- The value of `sm` will be the cumulative sum of the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- The value of `sp` will be the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times.
- The value of `bp` will be the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times.
