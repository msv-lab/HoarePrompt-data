Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1)`. If `k` is 0, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * -1`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * -1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
