Output State: **`i` is `t - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - n` (or `k` is `0` if the loop breaks), `b` is the value after `n` iterations of `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `n` iterations of `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative result of `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the cumulative result of `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, `sp` is `sp + sum(a[p[s] - 1] for _ in range(n))`, `bp` is `bp + sum(a[p[b] - 1] for _ in range(n))`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, and if `bm` is less than `sm`, `bm` is strictly less than `sm`. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, then `bm` is equal to `sm`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following state will be true:

- The loop index `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` test cases.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value in each test case.
- The variable `k` will be `k - n` after each test case, or `0` if the loop breaks when `k` reaches `0`.
- The variable `b` will be the value obtained after applying the permutation `p[b] - 1` `n` times.
- The variable `s` will be the value obtained after applying the permutation `p[s] - 1` `n` times.
- The variable `bm` will be the cumulative result of adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration over `n` iterations.
- The variable `sm` will be the cumulative result of adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration over `n` iterations.
- The variable `sp` will be the initial `sp` plus the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
- The variable `bp` will be the initial `bp` plus the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
- The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` will determine the output:
  - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the output will be "Bodya".
  - If `bm` is less than `sm`, the output will be "Sasha".
  - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the output will be "Draw".
