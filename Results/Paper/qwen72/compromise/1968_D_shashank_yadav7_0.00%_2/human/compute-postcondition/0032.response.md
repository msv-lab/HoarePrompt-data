The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**
