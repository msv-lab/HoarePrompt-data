Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `j` is the second character in `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0, making the number of 'A' characters (`l`) greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`). If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 3, making the number of 'A' characters (`l`) less than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`). In both cases, the relationship between `l` and `h` is maintained as specified.***
