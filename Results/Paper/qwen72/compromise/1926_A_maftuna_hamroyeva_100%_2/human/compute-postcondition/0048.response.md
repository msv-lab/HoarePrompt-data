Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If `l` > `h`, the relationship between `l` and `h` is such that `l` is greater than `h`. Otherwise, the relationship between `l` and `h` is maintained such that `l` is less than or equal to `h`.***
