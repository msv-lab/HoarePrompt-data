Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 2. In both cases, if `l` > `h`, the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is not greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`). Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.***
