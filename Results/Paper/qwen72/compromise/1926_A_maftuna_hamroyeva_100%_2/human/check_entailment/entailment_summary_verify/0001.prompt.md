You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 'A' or 'B' has been printed based on the comparison of counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, processing each test case individually. This is done with `for i in range(t):`.

3. **Reading Each String**: Inside the loop, the program reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. This is correctly handled using `a = input()`.

4. **Counting 'A' and 'B'**: The program initializes two counters, `l` for 'A' and `h` for 'B', both set to 0. It then iterates through each character in the string `a` and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'. This is done with the following code:
   ```python
   l = 0
   h = 0
   for j in a:
       if j == 'A':
           l += 1
       else:
           h += 1
   ```

5. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program checks which counter is greater and prints the corresponding character. If `l` (count of 'A') is greater than `h` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This is done with:
   ```python
   if l > h:
       print('A')
   else:
       print('B')
   ```

6. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the most frequent character for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the specified requirements. It reads the input, processes each test case, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
