### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(number):** This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is a straightforward and correct implementation for the modulo operation.
   - **func_2(arr):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues with this function:
     - The initialization of `new_segment` and `max_segment` as lists is inconsistent. `new_segment` should be a single integer representing the current segment sum, and `max_segment` should be a tuple or list containing the maximum segment sum and its indices.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has negative numbers, leading to incorrect results.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\).
   - **func_3(number, quantity):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the final answer, but it is not implemented.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we should focus on the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, inserting it will not increase the sum, so we should just return the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to use a more reliable method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, such as Kadane's algorithm.
   - We then need to calculate the final sum after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation.

### Detailed Analysis of Provided Functions:

- **func_1(number):**
  - This function is correct and should be used to ensure the final result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **func_2(arr):**
  - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray but is flawed:
    - **Initialization:** `new_segment` should be initialized as a single integer, and `max_segment` should be a tuple or list containing the maximum sum and its indices.
    - **Updating Logic:** The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect. It does not handle negative numbers properly and does not reset `new_segment` correctly.
    - **Appending to `segments_variants`:** This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
    - **Final Loop:** The loop to find the maximum segment is flawed because it does not handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\).

- **func_3(number, quantity):**
  - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It should calculate the final answer by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`, the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` does not implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
