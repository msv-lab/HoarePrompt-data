### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(number):** This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is a straightforward and correct implementation for the modulo operation.
   - **func_2(arr):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, the implementation has several issues:
     - **Initialization and Usage of `new_segment` and `max_segment`:** `new_segment` is initialized as an empty list but is used inconsistently. It should be a list with a single element or empty, but the code treats it as a list with multiple elements.
     - **Logic for Updating `max_segment` and `new_segment`:** The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has negative numbers. Specifically, the condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is incorrect because `new_segment` might be empty, and the logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is redundant and can lead to incorrect results.
     - **Final Loop to Find Maximum Segment:** The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed. It initializes `total_max_segment` to \([-1]\), which can lead to incorrect results if no valid segment is found.
   - **func_3(number, quantity):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the final answer, but it is not implemented.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we should focus on the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, inserting it will not increase the sum, so we should just return the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to use a more reliable method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, such as Kadane's algorithm.
   - We then need to calculate the final sum after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:

- **State Before `func_2` Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers such that \(-10^9 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(0 \leq i < len(arr)\).

- **Inside `func_2`:**
  - The function initializes `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` as lists.
  - It iterates through the array, attempting to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
  - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
  - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
  - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed, as it initializes `total_max_segment` to \([-1]\), which can lead to incorrect results if no valid segment is found.

- **State After `func_2` Call:**
  - `max_segment` is supposed to be the segment with the highest sum, but due to the flawed logic, it may not be correct.
  - The function returns `max_segment`, which is a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If no valid segment is found, it returns \([-1]\).

- **Main Program:**
  - The main program reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment, and calculates the final answer.
  - The formula used to calculate the final answer is incorrect. It should be \( \text{max\_segment\_sum} \times (2^k - 1) + \text{sum}(a) \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues in the provided functions, particularly the flawed logic in `func_2` and the incorrect formula in the main program, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
