The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The state of `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop, and `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
