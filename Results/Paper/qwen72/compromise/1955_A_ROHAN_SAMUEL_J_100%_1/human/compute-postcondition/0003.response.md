Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
