Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the price of two yogurts at the promotion price is less than or equal to the price of two yogurts at the regular price, but the number of yogurts is odd. In such a case, the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price, even when it might be cheaper to buy an additional pair at the promotion price and discard one yogurt.

Example Input:
```
1
3 5 9
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
Actual Output:
```
14
```

Example Input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
Expected Output:
```
13
```
Actual Output:
```
15
```

In the second example, the program should output 13 because it is cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price (8 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles), totaling 13 burles. However, the program outputs 15, which is incorrect.
