Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Odd `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price `b` is cheaper than buying them individually at the regular price `a`.
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buys the last yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Logic for Even `n`**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price `b` is cheaper than buying them individually at the regular price `a`.
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price, resulting in `n // 2 * b`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for both odd and even values of `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
