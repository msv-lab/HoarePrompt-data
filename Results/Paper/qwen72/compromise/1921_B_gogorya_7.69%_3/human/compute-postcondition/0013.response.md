Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `i` is 0. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and remains greater than -1. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.***
