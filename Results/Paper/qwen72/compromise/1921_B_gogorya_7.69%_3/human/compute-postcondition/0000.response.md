Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
