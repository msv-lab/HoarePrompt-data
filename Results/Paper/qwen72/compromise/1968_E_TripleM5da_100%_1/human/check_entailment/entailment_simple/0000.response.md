Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program takes an integer \(t\) as input, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes an integer \(n\) and prints \(n\) points that should maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\) using `int(input())`.

2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints the point \((1, 1)\) as the first point.
   - The program prints the point \((1, 2)\) as the second point.
   - For the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).

3. **Manhattan Distance Analysis:**
   - The Manhattan distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The Manhattan distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1\).
   - The Manhattan distance between \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \(3 \leq i < j \leq n\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2(j-i)\).

4. **Distinct Distances:**
   - The distances generated are:
     - \(1\) (from \((1, 1)\) to \((1, 2)\)).
     - \(2(i-1)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).
     - \(2(i-1) - 1\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).
     - \(2(j-i)\) for \(3 \leq i < j \leq n\).
   - These distances are distinct because:
     - \(1\) is unique.
     - \(2(i-1)\) and \(2(i-1) - 1\) are distinct for each \(i\).
     - \(2(j-i)\) for \(3 \leq i < j \leq n\) are distinct and different from the previous distances.

5. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The program ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the maximum number of distinct distances by strategically placing points.
   - For \(n = 2\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.
   - For larger \(n\), the program continues to generate distinct distances, ensuring the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case \(n = 2\) correctly by printing \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - For \(n \geq 3\), the program prints points that ensure the maximum number of distinct distances.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
