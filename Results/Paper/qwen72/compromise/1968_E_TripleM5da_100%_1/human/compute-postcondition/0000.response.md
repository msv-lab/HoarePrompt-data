The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute based on the input value, so the input must be a positive integer. The variable `i` will start at 0 as per the loop definition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
