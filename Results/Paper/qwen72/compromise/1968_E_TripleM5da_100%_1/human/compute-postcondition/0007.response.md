Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is 1.

The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly defined as 1, the output will be:

Output: **1 1**
