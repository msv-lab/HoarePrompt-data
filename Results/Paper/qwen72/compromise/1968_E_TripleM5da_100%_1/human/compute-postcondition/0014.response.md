Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 50.
   - For each of the `t` test cases:
     - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\). This means `n` can be any integer from 3 to 1000.
     - `i` is set to the value of `n`.
     - `n` is then updated to an input integer greater than or equal to the previous value of `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - It simply prints the integers 1 and 2.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will always print the same values regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the given code snippet is:

Output: **1 2**
