The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 2**
