Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` will be reinitialized to 3 by the loop.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is reinitialized to 3 by the loop, the value of `i` at the time of the `print` statement is 3. Therefore, the `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **3, 3**
