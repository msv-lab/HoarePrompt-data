To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is now an input integer greater than or equal to the previous value of `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(3, n + 1)` is not empty. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop starts, but this is not relevant to the loop head. The loop will reinitialize `i` to 3 for each iteration.
4. **State of `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. The given state already ensures that `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, so `n` is already in a valid range for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is not relevant to the loop head and will be reinitialized by the loop.
- `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute, which is already satisfied by the given state.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3, and `i` will be reinitialized to 3 by the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` will be reinitialized to 3 by the loop**.
