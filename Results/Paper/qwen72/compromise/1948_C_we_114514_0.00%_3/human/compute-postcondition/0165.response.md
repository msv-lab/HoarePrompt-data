The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
  - `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the rows.
  - `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, while each 'NO' indicates that the robot cannot do so.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, and 'NO' if the robot cannot do so.**
