Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then: if `row1[j]` is '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is updated to True. Otherwise, if `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `reachable_first_row` is False, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `reachable_second_row` is True.**
