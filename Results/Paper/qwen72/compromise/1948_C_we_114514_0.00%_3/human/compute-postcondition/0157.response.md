Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n - 1`. `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, and their final values depend on the characters in `row1` and `row2` at each position `j` from 0 to `n - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The list `test_cases` still contains at least 3 test cases.
- The variable `test_case` is still the third test case in the list.
- The variable `n` is still the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0.
- The variables `row1` and `row2` are still the second and third elements of the third test case, respectively.
- The list `results` still contains the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.
- The loop variable `j` will have iterated through all positions from 0 to `n - 1`, and will end up with the value `n - 1`.
- The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. Specifically:
  - If `reachable_first_row` is True at any point, and the character at position `j` in `row1` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` will become True if `j` is the last position (`j == n - 1`).
  - If `reachable_first_row` is True at any point, and the character at position `j` in `row1` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` will become False. If `j` is not the last position and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` will become True.
  - If `reachable_second_row` is True at any point, and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` will remain True.
  - If `reachable_second_row` is False, it will remain False throughout the loop.
- The final values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will depend on the characters in `row1` and `row2` at each position `j` from 0 to `n - 1`.
