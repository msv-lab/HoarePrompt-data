Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is 2. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is not equal to `n - 1`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `row2[j] != '>'`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.***
