Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True, and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

The code snippet does not change any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. The variable `reachable_second_row` is already set to `True` in the initial state, and the code snippet simply reassigns it to `True` again, which has no effect. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.
