t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes; the second line contains a string s of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the initial state of the boxes; the third line contains a string f of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
