The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is understood that the function will process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string `s` of length `n` containing characters '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string `f` of length `n` containing characters '0' or '1' representing the desired state of the boxes. The function processes `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns the number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s`) to the desired state (`f`) for each test case. If the transformation is impossible, the function returns an appropriate error message for that test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `s` representing the initial state of `n` boxes, and a string `f` representing the desired state of `n` boxes. It returns the number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state for each test case, or an error message if the transformation is impossible.**
