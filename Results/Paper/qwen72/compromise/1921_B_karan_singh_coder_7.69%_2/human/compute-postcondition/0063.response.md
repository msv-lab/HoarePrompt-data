Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `s` representing the initial state of `n` boxes, and a string `t` representing the desired state of `n` boxes. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` to the desired state `t`. The number of operations is determined based on the number of differing positions between `s` and `t` and the difference in the count of '1' characters between `s` and `t`. If the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t` is the same, the function prints the count of differing positions if there are any, otherwise it prints 0. If the number of '1' characters differs, it calculates the number of operations as the sum of the absolute difference in '1' counts and half the remaining differing positions. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. **
