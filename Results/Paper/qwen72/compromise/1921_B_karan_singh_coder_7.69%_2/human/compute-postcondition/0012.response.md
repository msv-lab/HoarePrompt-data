Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is different from `t[2]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the character at index 2 of `s` is different from the character at index 2 of `t`.
- If `s[2]` is the same as `t[2]`, `cnt` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
