arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the sizes of the piles in a game. The length of arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and each inner list has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all inner lists does not exceed 2·10^5.
