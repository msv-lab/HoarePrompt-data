You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take four integers as input, representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively. These integers are non-negative and do not exceed 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the value of `cnt` for each iteration of the loop, where `cnt` is calculated based on the input list `a` and the condition specified. The variables `a` and `cnt` will be re-initialized in each iteration, and their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. The input list `a` will contain four integers, and `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus 1 if all elements in `a` are odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win in a game where the winner is decided by the bitwise XOR of the sequence of numbers.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero; Alice wins if it is non-zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence have even counts.
   - XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if at least one of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s is odd.

3. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, Bob wins once (since the XOR will be zero).
   - This is because the XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0, and having an odd count of each will make the overall XOR zero.

4. **Removing Numbers:**
   - Each time Eve removes a number, she can potentially change the parity of the counts.
   - Removing a number from an odd count makes it even, and removing a number from an even count makes it odd.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s become even as often as possible.

5. **Counting Wins:**
   - For each test case, we need to count how many times Bob can win.
   - Initially, if all counts are odd, Bob wins once.
   - For each number in the sequence, removing it can potentially make the counts even, contributing to Bob's wins.

6. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The given program starts by checking if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd. If they are, it increments the win count by 1.
   - Then, it adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the win count. This is because removing pairs of numbers (which is the maximum number of pairs that can be removed from each count) will make the counts even, contributing to Bob's wins.

7. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial condition where all counts are odd.
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed from each count, which is a valid way to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The program does not consider the count of 4s in the initial condition check, but since 4 is 0 in binary, it does not affect the XOR result and can be safely ignored.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct in determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
