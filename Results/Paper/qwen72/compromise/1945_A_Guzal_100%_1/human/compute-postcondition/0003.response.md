The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function accepts three parameters, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The output of the function is not provided, so it is not possible to describe what the function returns. 

To fulfill the task, I will assume that the function definition should include these parameters, and I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function's return value is not specified, so its output cannot be determined from the given information.**
