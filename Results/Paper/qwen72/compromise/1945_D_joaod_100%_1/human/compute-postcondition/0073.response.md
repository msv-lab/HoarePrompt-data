The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v` and `na_frente`. The loop iterates backwards from `na_frente` to 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be decremented by 1, and `na_frente` must remain the same or be greater than `v`.

At the end of the last iteration, `v` is `na_frente`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be `na_frente - 1`, and `na_frente` must be at least 0. Since `v` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `v` is `na_frente - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` was greater than the new `total`, `best` is updated to this new value; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.**
