Output State: **`na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`na_frente` must be at least 0**: This is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`v` is -1**: After the loop completes, `v` will be -1 because the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` to -1.
- **`total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0**: The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0, and at each step, it adds the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` to `total`.
- **`best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`**: If `v` (the current index) is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the loop checks if `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current `best` and updates `best` if it is. This means `best` will be the smallest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.
