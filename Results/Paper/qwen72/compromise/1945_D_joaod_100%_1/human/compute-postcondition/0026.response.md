To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over the range starting from `na_frente` down to 0, decrementing by 1 each time. The loop will execute one more time if `v` is still greater than or equal to 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5
- `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `c` is 0
- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input
- `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller
- `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged
- If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains the maximum float value

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is the current value of the loop variable
- `na_frente` is the starting value of the loop variable

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `v` is decremented by 1, so `v` is now `v - 1`
- `na_frente` remains the same, as it is the starting value of the loop and does not change within the loop
- The loop will execute one more time if `v - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `v` must be greater than 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged, `v` is `v - 1`, and `v` must be greater than 0**
