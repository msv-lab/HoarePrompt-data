Postcondition: **`na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum representable floating-point number, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change `a` at index `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass `b` at index `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
