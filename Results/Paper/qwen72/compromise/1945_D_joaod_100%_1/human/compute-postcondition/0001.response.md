The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `c` is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 before the first iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` must be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
