Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `a` and `b` have swapped their values, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[1]` > `a` and `a` > `b` did not cause a swap.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1 if `l[1]` is greater than the original value of `a` and the original value of `a` was greater than the original value of `b`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.
