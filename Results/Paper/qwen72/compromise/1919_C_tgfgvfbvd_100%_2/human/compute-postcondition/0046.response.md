Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. The current value of `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and the current value of `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. Both `a` and `b` are now `float('inf')`, and the condition that `a` was greater than `b` is no longer valid. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
