Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0 or 1, `a` is equal to `l[1]`.**

The value of `a` is updated to the value of the second element in the list `l` (since `x` is 1). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
