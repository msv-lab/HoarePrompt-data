The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
