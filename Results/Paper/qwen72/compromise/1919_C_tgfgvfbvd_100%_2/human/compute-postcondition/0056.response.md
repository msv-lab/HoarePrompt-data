Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')`. The element `l[0]` is greater than the previous value of `a`.***
