Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1. If `l[1]` ≤ `b`, then `b` is equal to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l[1]` > `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values, and `c` is increased by 1.***
