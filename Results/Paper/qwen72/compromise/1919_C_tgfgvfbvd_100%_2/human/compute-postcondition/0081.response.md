Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `a` and `b` are both set to `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` (which were the smallest and second smallest integers in the list `l`) are no longer valid.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
