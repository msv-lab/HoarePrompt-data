Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def maximize_product(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two strings `x` and `y` representing the integers. Each string `x` and `y` consists of digits from 1 to 9 and are of the same length.
