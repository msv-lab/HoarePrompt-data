Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
- The list `palka` is the same as the input list of integers.
- The dictionary `d` now contains the count of each unique integer in `palka`.
- The list `pl` contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- The variable `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the counts in `d` by 3 for all integers that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
