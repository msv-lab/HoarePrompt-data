Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`, which means `d` now holds no key-value pairs. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
