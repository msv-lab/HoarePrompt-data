Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `j` is the second element of `pl`, `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `shapes` is updated by adding `d[j] // 3` to its current value.
- If `d[j]` is at least 3, `d[j] // 3` will be a positive integer, and `shapes` will be incremented by this value.
- If `d[j]` is less than 3, `d[j] // 3` will be 0, and `shapes` will remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, `j`) retain their original values and conditions.
