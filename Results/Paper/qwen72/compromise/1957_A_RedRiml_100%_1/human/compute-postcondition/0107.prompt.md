Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, and `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 (if `i` was not initially in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` was not initially in `d`, its value is set to 1 and `i` is appended to `pl`. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` was not initially in `pl`, it is now appended to `pl`, and if `i` was not initially in `d`, its value is set to 1. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
