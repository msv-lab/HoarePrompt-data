Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list that now contains the first element of `palka`, the second element `i`, the third element `i`, and the third element `i` appended again.**
