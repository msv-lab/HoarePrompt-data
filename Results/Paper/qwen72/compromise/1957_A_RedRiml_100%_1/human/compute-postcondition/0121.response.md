Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is 0, `_` is `w-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka` for each iteration of the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `w` iterations, the following state will be true:

- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100 for each test case.
- The variables `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain integers within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `w` is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- The loop counter `_` is `w-1`, meaning it has reached the last iteration index.
- For each iteration, `ln` is an input integer representing the length of the list `palka`.
- `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, with `n` elements.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, in the order they first appeared.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka`, and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
- `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appears at least 3 times in `palka`, for each iteration of the loop. This means that for each list `palka` processed, the number of shapes (groups of 3 identical integers) is calculated and printed.
