The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `palka` must have at least one more integer, and `i` will be set to the next integer in `palka`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first integer in `palka`, and `palka` must have at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 integers, and `i` will be set to the second integer in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 (if `i` was not initially in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`).**
