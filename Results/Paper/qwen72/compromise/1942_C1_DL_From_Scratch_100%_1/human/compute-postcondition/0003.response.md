The function `max_triangles` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, with the constraint 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, with the constraint 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5). `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices of the polygon, excluding the vertices in `chosen_vertices`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon), `x` (an integer representing the number of chosen vertices), and `chosen_vertices` (a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices).
