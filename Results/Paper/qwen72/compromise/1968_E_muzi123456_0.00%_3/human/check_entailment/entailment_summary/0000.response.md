Reasoning:  
The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided, however, does not attempt to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Instead, it always prints the same set of points for any given \(n\), specifically the points \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\).

Let's analyze why this approach is incorrect:

1. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\). This means that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will only contain the values \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\). The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(n\), which is not necessarily the maximum possible size.

2. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\)**: To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), we need to choose points such that the set of all possible Manhattan distances between any pair of points is as large as possible. For example, for \(n = 3\), the optimal arrangement given in the problem description is \((2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), a set of size 4.

3. **General Strategy**: A general strategy to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) is to choose points that are spread out across the grid. For example, for \(n = 4\), the points \((1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)\) result in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 6, which is larger than the set produced by the program.

4. **Program Output**: The program always outputs points in the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). This results in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) that is not maximized for \(n > 2\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
