Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

2. **Output Generation**: For each test case, the function prints `n` points in the format `(1, i)` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`. This means that all points are on the first row of the grid.

3. **Manhattan Distance Analysis**:
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points `(1, i)` and `(1, j)` is `|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|`.
   - The possible values of `|i-j|` range from 0 to `n-1` because `i` and `j` can be any integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Therefore, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1`, which means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is `n`.

4. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), which is the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For an \(n \times n\) grid, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is `n`, as shown above.
   - The function achieves this by placing all points in the first row, ensuring that the distances between any two points cover all values from 0 to `n-1`.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The function does not output an empty line at the end of each test case, which is explicitly stated as not necessary in the problem description.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required points for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
