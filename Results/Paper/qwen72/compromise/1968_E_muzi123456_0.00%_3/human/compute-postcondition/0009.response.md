Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `t` is then updated to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The update to `t` and the value of `n` do not affect the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
