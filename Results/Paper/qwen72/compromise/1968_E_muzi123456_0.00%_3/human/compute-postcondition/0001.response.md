The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) provided by the user. Since `t` is already a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), representing the size of an n x n grid. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) provided by the user.**
