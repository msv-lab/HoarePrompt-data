Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
   - `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The values of `t` and `n` are not directly relevant to the `print` statement, as `i` is the only variable being printed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
