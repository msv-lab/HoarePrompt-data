Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
- `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` with the `end` parameter set to `' '`. This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line and add a space.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output of this specific statement.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.
Output: **1 **
