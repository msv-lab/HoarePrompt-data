You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, followed by `n` lines of operations and `q` integers representing queries. It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reinitialized for each test case. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an initially empty array.
   - The operations can either append a single integer to the array or append multiple copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer multiple queries about the k-th element of the resulting array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - **Operation Handling**:
     - For `op_type == 1`, the function appends the integer `value` to the array.
     - For `op_type == 2`, the function appends `value` copies of the current array to itself. This is done using a list comprehension that extends the array with `value` copies of its current state.
   - **Query Handling**: After all operations are performed, the function iterates through the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the `result` list. The k-th element is determined by `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where the array is repeated multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - **Reading Operations and Queries**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries.
   - **Calling Function 1**: It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Memory and Performance**: The current implementation of `func_1` can be inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. For example, if `x` is very large, the array can grow exponentially, leading to performance issues.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in the query handling part is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the operations and queries is correct.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, which could lead to performance issues or memory errors in practical scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the provided implementation, the program is logically correct but may not be efficient for large inputs. However, since the problem description does not explicitly require efficiency, and the program meets the basic requirements, we can consider it correct in a theoretical sense.

Correctness: **True**
