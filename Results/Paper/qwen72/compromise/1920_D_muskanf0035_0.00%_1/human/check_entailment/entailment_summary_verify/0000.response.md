### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The issue lies in the implementation of the second type of operation in `func_1`. According to the problem description, when the operation type is 2, the array should be extended by `x` copies of itself. However, the provided code only appends one copy of the array, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Operation 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - Operation 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result`.
     - It iterates through the operations:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends one copy of the current array to itself, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to append `x` copies of the array.
     - After processing all operations, it processes the queries by appending the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
     - Finally, it returns the result list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
     - It reads the operations and queries from the input.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation for the second type of operation should be:
     ```python
     array.extend(array * (value - 1))
     ```
     This ensures that `x` copies of the array are appended.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     5 10
     1 1
     1 2
     2 2
     1 3
     2 3
     1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
     ```
   - After the first operation: `array = [1]`
   - After the second operation: `array = [1, 2]`
   - After the third operation (2 2): `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (should be 2 copies of `[1, 2]`)
   - After the fourth operation: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
   - After the fifth operation (2 3): `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` (should be 3 copies of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`)

   - The expected output for the queries is:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1
     ```

   - The actual output from the provided program is:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the second type of operation correctly. The function `func_1` should append `x` copies of the array to itself, but it only appends one copy. This leads to incorrect results for queries that depend on the repeated structure of the array.
