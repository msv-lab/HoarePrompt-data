Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. If op_type is 1, then 1 <= value <= n. If op_type is 2, then 1 <= value <= 10^9. queries is a list of positive integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after all n operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `array` contains the elements appended and extended based on the operations list, and `result` remains an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `array` remains unchanged, and `result` contains the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple represents an operation type and a value, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It modifies an internal array based on the operations provided: if the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array; if the operation type is 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements. After processing all operations, the function returns a list `result` containing the elements from the array at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes the modified array and the returned `result` list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. n and q are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2. queries is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2, `queries` is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations. The loop will have printed the results of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will be reinitialized for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, followed by `n` lines of operations and `q` integers representing queries. It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reinitialized for each test case. The function does not return any value.
