Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `b · gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. The solution is structured into two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the point where `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1, ensuring that both `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, effectively processing each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly identifies pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and ensures that both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.
  - The condition `b · gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is implicitly checked by the gcd condition and the constraints on `x` and `y`.
  - The function correctly counts the number of valid pairs and prints the result.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.
  - This ensures that the program processes each test case independently and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Both functions work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
