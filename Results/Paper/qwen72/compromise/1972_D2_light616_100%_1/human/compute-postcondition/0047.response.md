Output State: **`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, `y` is increased by 1, and `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`; `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`**

Explanation:
- `n` remains at least 20.
- `x` and `y` remain integers.
- `y` is increased by 1.
- The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must still be satisfied.
- `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of the two values: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This means `cnt` is updated to reflect the addition of this minimum value.
