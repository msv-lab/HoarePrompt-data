To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` must be at least 12
   - `m` must be at least 10
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 2
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 (let's assume `cnt` was initially 0, so now `cnt` is 1)

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     - `x + y` is `3 + 2` which equals `5`
     - `5 * x` is `5 * 3` which equals `15`
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
     - `x + y` is `3 + 2` which equals `5`
     - `5 * y` is `5 * 2` which equals `10`
   - Calculate `n // 15`:
     - Since `n` is at least 12, `n // 15` is `0` (because 12 divided by 15 is less than 1)
   - Calculate `m // 10`:
     - Since `m` is at least 10, `m // 10` is `1` (because 10 divided by 10 is exactly 1)
   - Determine `min(n // 15, m // 10)`:
     - `min(0, 1)` is `0`

3. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is increased by `0`
   - Therefore, `cnt` remains `1`

4. **Final Output State:**
   - `n` must be at least 12
   - `m` must be at least 10
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 2
   - `cnt` is 1

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 1**
