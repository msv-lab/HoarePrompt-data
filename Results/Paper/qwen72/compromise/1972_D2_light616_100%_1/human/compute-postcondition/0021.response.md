Output State: **`n` and `m` as the input integers, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is set to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The calculation for `cnt` still depends on the conditions specified in the initial state, but now `y` is explicitly set to 1.
