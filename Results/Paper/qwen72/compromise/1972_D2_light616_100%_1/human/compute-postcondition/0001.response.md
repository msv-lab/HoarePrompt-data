The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer and is expected to be within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0.

Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, no adjustment is needed for `_`.

Therefore, the state should reflect that `t` is within the specified range and the loop is ready to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4**
