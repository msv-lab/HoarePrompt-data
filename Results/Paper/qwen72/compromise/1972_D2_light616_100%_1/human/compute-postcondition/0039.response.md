To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is at least 18.
   - `m` is at least 18.
   - `x` is 4.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `cnt` is increased by 2 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it can be ignored).

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substitute the current values of `x` and `y` into the condition:
     - `(x + y) * x = (4 + 1) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20`.
     - `(x + y) * y = (4 + 1) * 1 = 5 * 1 = 5`.

4. **Check the Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true:
     - `20 <= n` (since `n` is at least 18, this condition is not satisfied because 20 is greater than 18).
     - `5 <= m` (since `m` is at least 18, this condition is satisfied).

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - To make the loop execute, we need to ensure that `20 <= n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 20.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 20, `m` is at least 18, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by 2**.
