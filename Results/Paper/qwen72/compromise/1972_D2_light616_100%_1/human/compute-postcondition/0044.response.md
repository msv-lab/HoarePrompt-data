Output State: **`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged. `y` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the GCD of `x` and `y` and the potential increment of `cnt` remains valid.
