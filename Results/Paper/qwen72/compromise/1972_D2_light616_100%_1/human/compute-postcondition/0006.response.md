The function `func_1()` is called, but without knowing what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables or the program state. However, since the function call itself does not modify the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`), we assume that `t` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies it.

Given that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0 (one iteration has passed, so `t` is now effectively `t - 1`), the output state remains the same unless `func_1()` changes it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` must be greater than 0 (one iteration has passed, so `t` is now effectively `t - 1`).**
