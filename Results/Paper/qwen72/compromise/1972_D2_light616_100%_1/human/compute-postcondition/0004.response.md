The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or what changes it might make to the program state. However, based on the initial state provided, we can only state that the function has been called, and no explicit changes to the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`) are observed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` must be greater than 0. The function `func_1()` has been called.**
