For the given task, let's analyze the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but it is incremented by the `range(t)` function.
- The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` will take values from 0 to `t-1`.
- After each iteration, the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since it is not used, we don't need to track its value explicitly.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

### State Adjustments:
- Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only relevant state is `t`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 (since the loop has already executed once, `t` must be at least 1).

### Final State:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` must be greater than 0**
