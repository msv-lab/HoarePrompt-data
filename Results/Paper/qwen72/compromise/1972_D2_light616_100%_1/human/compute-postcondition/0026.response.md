The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition `gcd(x, y) == 1` is still true because the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2 is 1. Therefore, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
