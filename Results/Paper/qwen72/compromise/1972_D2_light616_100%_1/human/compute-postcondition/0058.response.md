The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, given the context of the parameter constraints (n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), it can be inferred that these parameters might be used within the function, but they are not part of the function's input parameters.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with such constraints, the function might perform some operation involving `n` and `m` and return a result based on these values.

Given the lack of specific output details, the best we can do is describe the function's expected behavior based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function operates with two positive integers, n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, but does not explicitly accept them as parameters. The function's return value is not specified, so its exact functionality cannot be determined without additional information.**
