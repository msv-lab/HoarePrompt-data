The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented to the next value, which is 3, and `n` must be such that `3 * 3` (or `9`) is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` and `m` as the input integers, `x` is 3, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied.**
