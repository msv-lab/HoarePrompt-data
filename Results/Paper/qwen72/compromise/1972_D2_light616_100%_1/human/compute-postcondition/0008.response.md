The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraint that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function signature does not include any parameters. Assuming `t` is supposed to be a parameter, the function would need to be defined to accept `t`.

Given the lack of information about the output, I'll assume the function is intended to return something based on the value of `t`. Since the specific output is not provided, I'll describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with such constraints.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept a parameter `t`, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to perform some operation or computation based on the value of `t`.**
