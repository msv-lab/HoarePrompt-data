Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array to determine if the operation can be applied to make all elements zero. However, the problem requires checking the entire array to ensure that the operations can be applied to make all elements zero. The conditions checked in the solution are not sufficient to determine the correctness for the entire array.

A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 and if the array can be transformed to zero by applying the operations correctly. The given solution does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the solution is incorrect:

1. The condition `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` only checks the first and last elements, which is not enough to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.
2. The operations described in the problem can be applied to any index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), and the solution does not consider the effect of these operations on the entire array.
3. The sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero using the given operations, and this check is not performed in the solution.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to implement a more comprehensive algorithm that checks the feasibility of the operations across the entire array.
