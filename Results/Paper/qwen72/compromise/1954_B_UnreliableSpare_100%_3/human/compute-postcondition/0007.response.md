Output State: **The value of `flag` will be False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are not equal. Otherwise, if all consecutive elements in the list `arr` are equal, `flag` will remain True. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged. `ans` is now `Decimal('Infinity')`. `val` is now `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is now 0.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same except that `val` is now set to the first element of the list `arr`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
