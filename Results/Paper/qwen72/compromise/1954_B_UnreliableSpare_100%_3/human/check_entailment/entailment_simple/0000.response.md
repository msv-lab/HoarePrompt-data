### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are not equal.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and the array is inherently beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. In this case, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` (which is `arr[0]`).
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found so far.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the array.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True`, the program outputs `-1` because the array is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program outputs `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Consecutive Elements Check:**
  - The program only checks for consecutive elements being the same, but it does not correctly handle the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. The logic of counting consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` and finding the minimum count is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements at positions where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and `a_i` is different.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - For the first test case `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because all elements are the same.
  - For the second test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct because removing the last element makes the array non-beautiful.
  - For the third test case `[1]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because a single-element array is always beautiful.
  - For the fourth test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because removing the element at index 3 (value `5`) makes the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the condition for making the array non-beautiful by removing elements. It only checks for consecutive elements being the same and does not consider the specific operation described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
