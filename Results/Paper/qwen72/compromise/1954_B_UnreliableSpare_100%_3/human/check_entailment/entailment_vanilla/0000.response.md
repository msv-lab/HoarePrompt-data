Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated by any valid count.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - After the loop, it ensures `ans` is updated with the count of the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not all the same, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array has only one element correctly by outputting `-1` (since a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a single pass through the array to determine the minimum number of elements to remove, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).

However, there is a potential issue with the use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for `ans`. While it works for the purpose of finding the minimum, it is not necessary to use `Decimal` for this problem. A simpler and more efficient approach would be to use a large integer like `float('inf')` or `math.inf`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct but can be improved for efficiency and simplicity.

Correctness: **True** (but can be optimized)
