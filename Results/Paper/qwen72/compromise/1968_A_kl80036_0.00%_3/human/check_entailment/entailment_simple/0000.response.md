### Reasoning:

The task is to find any integer \( y \) (1 â‰¤ \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided attempts to solve this by choosing \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (i.e., the integer division of \( x \) by 2).

Let's analyze why this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Properties**:
   - The GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) will be at most \( x // 2 \) because \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that can be a divisor of \( x \) (if \( x \) is even, \( x // 2 \) is exactly \( x/2 \); if \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x/2 \)).

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - If \( y = x // 2 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even (since \( x \) is divisible by \( x // 2 \)).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) will be the largest integer less than \( x/2 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be 1 (since \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime).
   - In both cases, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be maximized because \( y \) is the largest possible value less than \( x \) that can be chosen.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), so \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \). \( \gcd(21, 10) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 100 // 2 = 50 \). \( \gcd(100, 50) = 50 \), so \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 // 2 = 1 \). \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 1000 // 2 = 500 \). \( \gcd(1000, 500) = 500 \), so \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \), so \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

In all these examples, the chosen \( y \) (which is \( x // 2 \)) indeed maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it consistently chooses \( y = x // 2 \), which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
