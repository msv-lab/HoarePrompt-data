Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which is not guaranteed to be the optimal \( y \).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
- \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).

However, if we consider \( y = 6 \):
- \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \).

In this case, \( y = 5 \) is indeed correct, but this is not always the case. For \( x = 21 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 10 \).
- \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \).

However, if we consider \( y = 18 \):
- \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \).

Here, \( y = 18 \) is the correct answer, but the program outputs \( y = 10 \).

To find the correct \( y \), a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as iterating through possible values of \( y \) and checking the \( \gcd \) to find the maximum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
