### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length in `num_list`. This is an efficient way to group and count the sticks by their lengths.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3}\) and adds it to `res`.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\) and adds it to `res`.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

4. **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies that for three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - Given that the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2 (e.g., \(2^a + 2^b < 2^c\) if \(a, b < c\)).

5. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using \(\binom{cnt}{3}\).
   - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length by not adding any combinations to `res`.
   - It also handles the case where there are no valid triangles by printing 0.

7. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case, which is the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The function `func_1` is described accurately in terms of its input and output.
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks, handles all edge cases, and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
