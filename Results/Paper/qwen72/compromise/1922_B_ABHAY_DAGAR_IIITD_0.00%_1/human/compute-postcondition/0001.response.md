The loop head contains the variable `_` and the object `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be an iterable, and in this case, it should be a list with at least one element. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `results` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks.
- The length of `test_cases` is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must have at least one test case.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
