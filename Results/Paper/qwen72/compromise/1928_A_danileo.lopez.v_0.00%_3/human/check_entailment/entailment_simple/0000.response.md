Reasoning:  
The program is designed to determine if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90° rotation are considered the same. The logic of the program is based on the observation that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original one. This is because an even side can be divided into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then any cut will result in rectangles that, when recombined, will either be the same as the original or a 90° rotation of it, which is not considered different.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates \(t\) times.
2. **Dimension Reading**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
3. **Condition Check**: It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
4. **Output**: If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The logic is correct because:
- If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and then form a new rectangle of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is also even) or \(2 \times \frac{ab}{2}\) (if \(b\) is odd).
- If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles and then form a new rectangle of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is also even) or \(a \times 2\frac{b}{2}\) (if \(a\) is odd).
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in rectangles that, when recombined, will either be the same as the original or a 90° rotation of it, which is not considered different.

Given the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
