Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by checking if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is not a 90-degree rotation of the original. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle because cutting an odd-sided rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that, when rearranged, will form the same rectangle (or a 90-degree rotation of it). The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description and outputs the correct answers based on the given logic.
