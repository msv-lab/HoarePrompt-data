Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a non-negative integer value from `func_3` and uses this value to call `func_6` the same number of times. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to execute `func_6` a specific number of times determined by the result of `func_3`. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called `testcases` times, where `testcases` is a non-negative integer. **
