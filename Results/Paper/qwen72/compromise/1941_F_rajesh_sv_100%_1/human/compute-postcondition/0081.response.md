Output State: **`l` is either `mid + 1` or `h - 1`, `h` is either unchanged or set to `mid`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is `h - 1` and `h` is set to `mid`. Ensure `l < h`.**

The code snippet `mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f` updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the current values of `mid`, `D`, and `f`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are now `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
