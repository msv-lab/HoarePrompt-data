Postcondition: **`f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `l` remains the index where `D[index]` is the first value greater than `left - f`. `h` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `h` remains the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f` and `h` must be greater than `l`; otherwise, `h` is set to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.**
