Postcondition: **The loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`. `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. `l` is now `h - 1`. `mid` is `h - 1`. `mid_sum` is `D[h - 1] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is `D[h] + f`. The current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than the current value of `right - mid_next_sum`.**
