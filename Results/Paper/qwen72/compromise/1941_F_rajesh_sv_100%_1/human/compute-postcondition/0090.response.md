Output State: **`f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is the index where `D[index]` is the first value greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index where `D[index] + f` is the closest value to `right - left` without exceeding it, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.**
