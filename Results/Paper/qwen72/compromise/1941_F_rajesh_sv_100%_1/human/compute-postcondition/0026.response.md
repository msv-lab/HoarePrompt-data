The code snippet `next_max_diff = max_diff` assigns the current value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` is now equal to `max_diff`, and `index` is 3 if `diff` > `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None.**
