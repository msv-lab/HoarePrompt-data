The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is 1 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.**
