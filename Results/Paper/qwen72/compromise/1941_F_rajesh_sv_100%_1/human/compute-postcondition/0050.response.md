Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, `h` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `h` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
