Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n, and two strings of arrows a and b, each of length n. After processing, it prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in b is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The values of t, n, a, and b are not retained after each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined.**
