The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` is a list of integers, where each element `n[i]` represents the number of sticks for the i-th test case, and 1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 100. `a` is a list of lists, where each sublist `a[i]` contains the lengths of the sticks for the i-th test case, and each stick length `a[i][j]` is an integer with 1 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to form a square using any four of the sticks provided. If it is possible to form a square, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a list of integers representing the number of sticks for each test case), and `a` (a list of lists containing the lengths of the sticks for each test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if it is possible to form a square using any four of the sticks for the corresponding test case, and "No" otherwise.**
