Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains `False` unless `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1), in which case `flag` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
