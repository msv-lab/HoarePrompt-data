Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it prints `2` when it finds a pair of friends who are best friends with each other, and it prints `3` otherwise. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
3
2
```

For the second test case, the program will print `3` because it does not find a pair of friends who are best friends with each other. However, the correct answer is `3` because sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 attend the party.

The program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of invitations required in cases where there are more complex relationships between friends, such as chains or cycles of best friends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
