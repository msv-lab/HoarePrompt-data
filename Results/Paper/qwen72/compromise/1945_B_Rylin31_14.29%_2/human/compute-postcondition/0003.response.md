The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`, and an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of `a`, `b`, and `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^18, and `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. However, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
