You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
        
    #State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The loop has completed all iterations, and the final values of a, b, and m are the same as their initial values for each test case. The output for each test case is either (min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1 or (min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b, depending on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Specifically, the program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m` and then uses this value to determine the number of fireworks. However, this approach does not correctly account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every 4 minutes. Each firework is visible for 11 minutes (from `x` to `x + 10`).

- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, ...

At time 12, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks will be visible from time 12 to time 22. Therefore, at time 12, there are 7 fireworks visible in the sky (from the first installation: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21; from the second installation: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24).

However, the provided program calculates `mn = min(3, 4) + 10 = 13` and then outputs `13 // 3 + 13 // 4 = 4 + 3 = 7`, which is correct for this specific case. But the logic is flawed and will not work for other cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time within the LCM period. The LCM will help you identify the points where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously, and you can then count the number of fireworks visible at those points.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the LCM period.
3. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time within the LCM period, considering the visibility duration `m`.

The provided program does not follow this correct approach and thus is incorrect.
