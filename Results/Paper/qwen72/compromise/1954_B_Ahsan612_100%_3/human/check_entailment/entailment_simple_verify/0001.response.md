### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. `minn` is set to infinity (`inf`).
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`same`).
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and continues.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, the logic to update `minn` and reset `same` is flawed. Specifically, the program increments `i` twice when it encounters a different element, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect results.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the array has more than one unique element but the minimum consecutive length is the length of the array itself. This can happen if the array is already not beautiful but all elements are the same.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly outputs `-1` for a single element array.
   - **All Elements Identical**: The program correctly outputs `-1` for an array where all elements are the same.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The program should correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly due to the double increment of `i`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - If the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful, so we should output `-1`.
   - If the array has more than one unique element, we should find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and remove them to break the beauty condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Specifically, the double increment of `i` when encountering a different element is incorrect and can lead to skipping elements. Additionally, the program does not properly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful but all elements are the same.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for num in ar:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
        
        # If there is only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful
        if len(freq) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements
        min_consecutive = float('inf')
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            same = 1
            while i < len(ar) - 1 and ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                same += 1
                i += 1
            min_consecutive = min(min_consecutive, same)
            i += 1
        
        # If the minimum consecutive length is the length of the array, it is impossible
        if min_consecutive == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_consecutive)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful by properly handling the logic for consecutive identical elements and edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
