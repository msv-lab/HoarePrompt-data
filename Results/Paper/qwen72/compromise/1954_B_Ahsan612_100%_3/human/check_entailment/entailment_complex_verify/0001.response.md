### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. `minn` is set to infinity (`inf`).
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`same`).
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and continues.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, the logic to update `minn` and reset `same` is flawed. Specifically, the program increments `i` twice in the `else` block, which can cause it to skip elements and incorrectly update `minn`.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful or where the array consists of a single element correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly outputs `-1` for a single element array.
   - **All Elements Identical**: The program correctly outputs `-1` for an array where all elements are the same.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It may skip elements and incorrectly update `minn`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - If the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful, so we should output `-1`.
   - If the array has more than one unique element, we should find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and remove them to break the beauty condition.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Single Element Array**:
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` for a single element array.
  - This is handled by the condition `if minn == inf or minn == len(ar): print(-1)`.

- **All Elements Identical**:
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` for an array where all elements are the same.
  - This is handled by the condition `if minn == inf or minn == len(ar): print(-1)`.

- **Mixed Elements**:
  - The program's logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is flawed.
  - The `else` block increments `i` twice, which can cause it to skip elements and incorrectly update `minn`.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will skip the second `1` and incorrectly update `minn`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for num in ar:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
        
        # If there is only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful
        if len(freq) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements
        min_consecutive = float('inf')
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            same = 1
            while i < len(ar) - 1 and ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                same += 1
                i += 1
            min_consecutive = min(min_consecutive, same)
            i += 1
        
        # If the minimum consecutive length is the length of the array, it is impossible
        if min_consecutive == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_consecutive)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the program's logic, particularly in the handling of the `else` block and the incorrect updating of `minn`. The program does not correctly handle the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, which can lead to incorrect outputs for mixed elements.

Final: **False**
