Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
5. `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
6. `i` is `len(ar)`.
7. `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
8. `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`.
9. `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.
10. `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(minn)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ar`**: This is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements. The exact values of the elements are not provided, but we know it has at least 2 elements.
2. **`i`**: This is the length of the list `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, `i` is at least 2.
3. **`num`**: This is the last integer in the list `ar`.
4. **`same`**: This is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`. For example, if `ar` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `same` would be 3 because the last sequence of consecutive identical integers is `[3, 3, 3]`.
5. **`minn`**: This is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. The initial value of `minn` is not explicitly given, but it is guaranteed to be neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of the previous `minn` and the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`.
- Since `minn` is guaranteed to be neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`, it must be a finite integer less than `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of the previous minn and the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in ar)**

This output is the most precise description based on the given precondition.
