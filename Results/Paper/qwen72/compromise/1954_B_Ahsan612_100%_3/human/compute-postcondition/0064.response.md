The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, `minn`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` depending on the initial conditions, `same` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, `i` is 3, 4, or 5 depending on the initial conditions.**
