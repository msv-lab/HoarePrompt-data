Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
5. `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.
6. `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
7. `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.
8. `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
9. `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.
10. `minn` is now the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.
11. `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(minn)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ar` is a list of integers input by the user.**
   - This means `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, and its length is `i`.

2. **`minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.**
   - This means `minn` is the smallest length of any subarray in `ar` where all elements are the same.

3. **`num` is the last integer in `ar`.**
   - This means `num` is the last element of the list `ar`.

4. **`same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.**
   - This means `same` is the length of the subarray at the end of `ar` where all elements are the same as `num`.

5. **`minn` is now the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.**
   - This means `minn` is updated to be the smaller of the original `minn` and `same`.

6. **`minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.**
   - This means `minn` is a finite value and is not equal to the length of the entire list `ar`.

### Final Output:
The `print(minn)` statement will print the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer, after updating `minn` to be the minimum value between the original `minn` and the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.

Since the exact values of `ar` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated minimum length.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer, updated to be the minimum value between the original minn and the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer)**
