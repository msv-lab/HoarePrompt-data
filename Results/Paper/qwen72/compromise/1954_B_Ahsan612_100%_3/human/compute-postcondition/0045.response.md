Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.**

The code snippet `minn = inf` sets `minn` to `inf`, which is the initial value provided. Therefore, the value of `minn` remains `inf`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
