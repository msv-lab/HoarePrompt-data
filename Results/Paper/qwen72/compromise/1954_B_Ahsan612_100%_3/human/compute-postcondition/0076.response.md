Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and the current value of `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the value printed is independent of the initial state and is always `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
