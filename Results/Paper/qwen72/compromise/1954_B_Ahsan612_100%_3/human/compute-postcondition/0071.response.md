Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `same` is 2, 3, or 4 if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, `i` is 4, 5, or 6 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6.**
