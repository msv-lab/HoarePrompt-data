Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `len(ar)` is greater than 4, `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 5, `minn` is 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[4]` if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is updated to `ar[5]`, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is initially set to infinity if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise it is set to 1.
- `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise it is 1.
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to the minimum of its current value and `same`.
- If `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, `minn` is initially infinity, and `same` is 3, so `minn` becomes 3.
- If `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, `minn` is initially 1, and `same` is 1, so `minn` remains 1.
- Therefore, in both cases, `minn` is 1 after the code execution.
