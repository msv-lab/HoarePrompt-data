The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, 4, or 5 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is 3, 4, or 5, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, the loop can certainly execute one more time if `i` is 3 or 4. If `i` is 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted if `i` is 3 or 4. If `i` is 5, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` depending on the initial conditions, `same` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, `i` is 3, 4, or 5 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 5**
