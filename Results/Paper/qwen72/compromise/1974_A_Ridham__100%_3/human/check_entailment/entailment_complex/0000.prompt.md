Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each of the `n` test cases, based on the given conditions. The length of `result` is equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` units of space for one type of element and `y` units of space for another type of element, where each screen can hold up to 15 units of space for the second type of element. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The final state of the program is that `n` lines have been printed, each containing the number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` are not modified by the function.
