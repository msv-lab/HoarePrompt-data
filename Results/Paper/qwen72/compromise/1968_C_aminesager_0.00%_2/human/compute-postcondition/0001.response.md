For the given task, the loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero). Given the state right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is inherently non-zero and thus truthy.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
