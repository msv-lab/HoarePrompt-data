Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `0`, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` updates the value of `T` to be a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
