To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is the last index of the list `T`.
2. **`n` remains the same**: `n` is the length of the list `T`.
3. **`a` is a list of integers**: The list `a` is constructed as follows:
   - The first element is `(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2]`.
   - The second element is `(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-3]) - T[n-3]`.
   - This pattern continues until the last element, which is `1000 - T[0]`.
   - The final element is `1000`.
4. **`result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces**: This means `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and concatenated with spaces in between.
5. **`t` is `0`**: This variable is not used in the print statement.
6. **`line` is the new input string**: This is a string that is split and converted to a list of integers `T`.
7. **`T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer**: This means `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Construct the list `a`**:
   - The list `a` is constructed based on the formula provided. Each element of `a` is derived from the list `T` and the constant `1000`.
   - For example, if `T = [100, 200, 300, 400]` and `n = 4`, then:
     - `a[0] = (1000 - 100 - 200 - 300) - 400 = 0`
     - `a[1] = (1000 - 100 - 200) - 300 = 400`
     - `a[2] = (1000 - 100) - 200 = 700`
     - `a[3] = 1000 - 100 = 900`
     - `a[4] = 1000`
   - Therefore, `a = [0, 400, 700, 900, 1000]`.

2. **Convert the list `a` to a string `result`**:
   - The list `a` is converted to a string where each element is separated by a space.
   - For the example above, `result = "0 400 700 900 1000"`.

3. **Print the string `result`**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the string `result`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 400 700 900 1000 (where the elements of `a` are derived from the list `T` and the constant 1000 as described)**

This output is based on the specific example provided. If the actual values of `T` are different, the elements of `a` will be calculated accordingly, but the format of the output will remain the same.
