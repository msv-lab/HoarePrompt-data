### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The function checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If this condition is true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable than using the promotional price. Therefore, the profit is `n * a`, which is correct.

3. **Promotional Price Calculation:**
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the function calculates the optimal number of buns to sell at the promotional price, which is `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the promotional price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{ans} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\). This formula correctly calculates the sum of the prices from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total profit, which is the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` can be 0, meaning no buns are sold at the promotional price.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning all buns are sold at the promotional price.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient and works within the constraints of \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering both the usual price and the promotional price. The calculations and conditions are accurate, and the function handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
