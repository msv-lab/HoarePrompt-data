Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are now the input integers provided. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `ans2`) and conditions (`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0) remain unchanged.
