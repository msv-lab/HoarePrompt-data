The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `a[2]` is subtracted twice from `ans1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + a[2])`.**
