Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` must still be greater than 0.
- `x` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of input integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` remains `x-1`.
- `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- `ans` is now the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
