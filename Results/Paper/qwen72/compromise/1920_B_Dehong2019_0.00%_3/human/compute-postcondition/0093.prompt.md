Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k and x are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. No other variables have been changed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` minus `2 * a[j + x]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` where `j + x < n`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` minus twice the sum of `a[j + x]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` where `j + x < n`, `ans2` remains equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
