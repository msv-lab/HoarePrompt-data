Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than `x`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is now `ans1 + a[x]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value at index `x` in the list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
