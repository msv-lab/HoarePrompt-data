Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[2]` from its current value. The current value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`. After the execution, `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
