Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[x] - 2 * a[x + x] + a[x + 1]` if `i + x < n` or `ans1 + a[x] + a[x + 1]` otherwise, `ans2` remains equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is assigned the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is now the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
