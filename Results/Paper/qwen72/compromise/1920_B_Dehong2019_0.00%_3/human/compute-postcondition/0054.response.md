Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[1 + x] * 2`, and `ans2` retains its value from the previous iteration. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` retain their values from the previous iteration. In both cases, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.***
