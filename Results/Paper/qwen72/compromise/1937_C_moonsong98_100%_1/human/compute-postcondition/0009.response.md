The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is not relevant since it is controlled by the loop itself. However, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The state of `max_index` and `min_indices` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing `[n-1]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
