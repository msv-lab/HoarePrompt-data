Output State: **`n` is 2, and 2 <= `n` <= 10^4. `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer with the value 2, and it is within the range 2 to 10^4.
- The code snippet calls the function `func_2` with arguments 0 and 1.
- Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its impact on the program state or any return value.
- Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `n` and includes the fact that `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.
