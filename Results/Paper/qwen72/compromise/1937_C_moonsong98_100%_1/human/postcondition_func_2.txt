The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of calls to `func_1`. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the maximum index and the minimum index (which is not equal to the maximum index, if such an index exists). The function does not return any value; it returns `None`.
