### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for n = 2**:
   - The program first checks if `n` is 2. If it is, it directly outputs the indices `0` and `1` because for `n = 2`, the maximum XOR value is always `1` (since the only possible permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`).
   - This is correct and efficient for the smallest case.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The program initializes `max_index` to 0.
   - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and compares `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `(p_0 | p_max_index) < (p_0 | p_i)`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `max_index` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when ORed with `p_0`, gives the maximum value. This is a good strategy because the OR operation tends to increase the value, and the maximum value will likely involve the largest elements in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
   - The program initializes `min_indices` with the current `max_index`.
   - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and compares `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) < (p_max_index | p_i)`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
   - If `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) == (p_max_index | p_i)`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
   - This step ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices `i` such that `(p_max_index | p_i)` is the minimum possible value. This is a good strategy because the XOR operation is maximized when the two numbers have the most different bits, and the minimum value of the OR operation helps in finding such pairs.

4. **Selecting the Minimum Index**:
   - The program initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It iterates through all indices in `min_indices` and compares `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `(p_min_index | p_min_index) == (p_min_index | p_i)`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `min_index` is the index of the element in `min_indices` that is different from `max_index` and has the same OR value with `max_index`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `max_index` and `min_index` using the `func_2` function.
   - This is the correct final step as it provides the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Query Count:
- The program makes at most `n` queries to find the `max_index`.
- It then makes at most `n` queries to find the `min_indices`.
- Finally, it makes at most `n` queries to select the `min_index`.
- Therefore, the total number of queries is at most `3n`, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. It also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed `3n`.

### Correctness:
**True**
