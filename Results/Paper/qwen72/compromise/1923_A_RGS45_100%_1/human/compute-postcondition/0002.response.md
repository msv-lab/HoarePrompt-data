Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each test case, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged. After all iterations, the loop will have completed its execution, and the final state of `t` will be the same as the initial state.**
