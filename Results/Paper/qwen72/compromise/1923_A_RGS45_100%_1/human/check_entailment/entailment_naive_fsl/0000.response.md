Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple chips and the closest free cell to the left is not the optimal choice for minimizing the number of moves. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be `2` because you can move the chip at position 4 to position 2, and then move the chip at position 5 to position 3, resulting in the block `1 1 1 1 0`. However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not the correct approach for determining the minimum number of operations.
