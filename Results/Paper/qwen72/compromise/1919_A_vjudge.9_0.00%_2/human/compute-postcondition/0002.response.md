The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `results` is an empty list**
