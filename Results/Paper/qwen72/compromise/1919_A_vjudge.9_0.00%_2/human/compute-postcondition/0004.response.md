The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. Given the state before the loop starts, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This ensures that `results` is not empty, as it contains at least one element (since `t` is at least 1). Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `result` will be the first element in `results` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, `result` is the first element in `results`**
