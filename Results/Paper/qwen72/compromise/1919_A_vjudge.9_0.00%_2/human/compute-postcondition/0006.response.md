The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it is implied that the function might use a variable `t` internally, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. However, we can infer that the function is likely to return a value or perform an action based on the internal use of `t`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It uses an internal variable `t` which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The specific return value or action based on `t` is not provided.**
