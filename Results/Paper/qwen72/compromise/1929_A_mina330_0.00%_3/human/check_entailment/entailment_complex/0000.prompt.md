Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: `ntest` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` for the first half of the list, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list for the first half of the list. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the input values for `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `a`, and `kq` are no longer relevant as they are local to the function.
