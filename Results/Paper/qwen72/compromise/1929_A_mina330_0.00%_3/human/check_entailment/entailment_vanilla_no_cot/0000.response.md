Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the maximum beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, moving inward from the ends of the array. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, which is the goal of the problem.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: For each test case, the array `a` is sorted. Sorting is a crucial step because it allows us to pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences.
3. **Calculating the Maximum Beauty**:
   - The program initializes a variable `kq` to 0, which will store the maximum beauty.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array, summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, it adds `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to `kq`.
4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the calculated maximum beauty for each test case.

This approach works because the sorted array ensures that the differences between the largest and smallest elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty for the array.

Let's verify the program with the given example:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = [2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Differences: `(3 - 1) = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2**: `a = [69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Differences: `(69 - 69) = 0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Test Case 3**: `a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Differences: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57 + 36 = 57`
  - Output: `57`

- **Test Case 4**: `a = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Differences: `(4 - 3) = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 5**: `a = [2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Differences: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1`

All the outputs match the expected results, confirming that the program is correct.
