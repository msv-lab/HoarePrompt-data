Output State: **`ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `kq` is updated by adding the difference between the third last element of the list `a` and the third element of the list `a` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
