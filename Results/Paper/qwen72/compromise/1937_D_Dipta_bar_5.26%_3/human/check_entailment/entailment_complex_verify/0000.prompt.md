You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and prints a sequence of integers representing the number of balanced pairs of '<' and '>' that can be formed by considering each position in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` contain intermediate values used for the computation, but they are not accessible to the user. The final state of the program is that the sequence of integers has been printed, and the function has completed its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'. For example, consider the input where `s` is ">>>>" or "<<<<". In such cases, the pinball should move in a single direction until it leaves the grid. However, the program's logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and may not handle these edge cases correctly.

For a more concrete example, let's consider the input:
```
1
4
<<<<
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2 3 4
```
However, the program's logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball may not produce this output correctly due to the way it calculates the time for each cell. Specifically, the program's handling of the `A` and `B` arrays and their indices may not work as intended for such simple, uniform cases.
