### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
   - **First Loop (for '>' characters)**:
     - The loop iterates through the string `s` and populates `A` and `idx_A` for each '>' character.
     - `A` stores the cumulative count of '>' characters from the start of the string up to each position where a '>' is found.
     - `idx_A` stores the indices of these '>' characters.
   - **Second Loop (for '<' characters)**:
     - The loop iterates through the string `s` in reverse and populates `B` and `idx_B` for each '<' character.
     - `B` stores the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end of the string up to each position where a '<' is found.
     - `idx_B` stores the indices of these '<' characters.
   - **Third Loop (for each cell)**:
     - The loop iterates through each cell of the string `s` to determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed at that cell.
     - The logic involves checking the direction of the character at the current cell (`s[i]`).
     - Depending on the direction, it uses the precomputed values in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` to calculate the time.
     - The calculations are based on the cumulative counts and the positions of the characters, which are used to determine the number of steps the pinball will take before leaving the grid.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time for each cell for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Correctness of `A` and `idx_A`**:
  - `A` and `idx_A` correctly track the cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
  - This helps in calculating the time for the pinball to move to the right and then potentially to the left.
- **Correctness of `B` and `idx_B`**:
  - `B` and `idx_B` correctly track the cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
  - This helps in calculating the time for the pinball to move to the left and then potentially to the right.
- **Correctness of the Third Loop**:
  - The loop correctly handles the different cases for each cell:
    - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts and positions of '>' and '<' characters.
    - If the cell contains '<', it calculates the time similarly.
  - The calculations are complex but follow the rules of the problem, ensuring that the pinball's movement is correctly simulated.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball's movement and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid. The use of precomputed cumulative counts and indices helps in efficiently determining the time for each cell.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
