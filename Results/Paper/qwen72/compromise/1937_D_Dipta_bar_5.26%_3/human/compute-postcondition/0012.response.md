To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables `l`, `r`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are modified within the loop. Given the initial state and the loop code, let's analyze the changes step by step.

### Initial State:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `idx_A` remains unchanged.
- `B` is `[0, 1]`.
- `idx_B` is `[5, 4]`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is 2.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the string `s` from `0` to `n-1`. The values of `l` and `r` are modified based on the characters in `s`. Let's assume `s` is a string of length `n` and contains characters `>` and `<`.

#### Iteration 1 (i = 0):
- `s[0]` is either `>` or `<`.
- If `s[0] == '>':`
  - `l` is incremented by 1.
  - `r` remains 2.
  - The condition `l < r` is true.
  - `a = A[0]` (since `l = 0`).
  - `x = 2 - (0 + 2) = 0`.
  - `b = B[1]` (since `r - 1 = 1`).
  - `b = b - B[0]` (since `x = 0`).
  - `b = b - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1]) * (0 + 1)`.
  - `b = (idx_B[1] - 0) * (0 + 1)`.
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + 0 + 1, end=' ')`.

- If `s[0] == '<':`
  - `r` is decremented by 1.
  - `l` remains 0.
  - The condition `l <= r` is true.
  - `a = 0` (since `l = 0`).
  - `b = B[1]` (since `r = 1`).
  - `b = b - B[1 - 0]` (since `r - l = 1`).
  - `b = b - (idx_B[1 - 0] - 0) * (1 - 0)`.
  - `b = b + (idx_B[1] - 0) * 0`.
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + 0 + 1, end=' ')`.

#### Iteration 2 (i = 1):
- `s[1]` is either `>` or `<`.
- If `s[1] == '>':`
  - `l` is incremented by 1.
  - `r` remains 2.
  - The condition `l < r` is true.
  - `a = A[1]` (since `l = 1`).
  - `x = 2 - (1 + 2) = -1` (not valid, so `x` is not used).
  - `b = B[1]` (since `r - 1 = 1`).
  - `b = (idx_B[1] - 1) * (1 + 1)`.
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 + 1, end=' ')`.

- If `s[1] == '<':`
  - `r` is decremented by 1.
  - `l` remains 0.
  - The condition `l <= r` is true.
  - `a = 0` (since `l = 0`).
  - `b = B[0]` (since `r = 0`).
  - `b = b - B[0 - 0]` (since `r - l = 0`).
  - `b = b - (idx_B[0 - 0] - 1) * (0 - 0)`.
  - `b = b + (idx_B[0] - 1) * 0`.
  - `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 + 1, end=' ')`.

### Final State:
After the loop finishes, the values of `l` and `r` will be modified based on the characters in `s`. However, the values of `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, and the values of `B` and `idx_B` are not modified within the loop.

Given the initial state and the loop code, the final state of the variables will be:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `idx_A` remains unchanged.
- `B` remains `[0, 1]`.
- `idx_B` remains `[5, 4]`.
- `l` will be the number of `>` characters in `s`.
- `r` will be `2 -` the number of `<` characters in `s`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `B` is `[0, 1]`, `idx_B` is `[5, 4]`, `l` is the number of `>` characters in `s`, `r` is `2 -` the number of `<` characters in `s`.**
