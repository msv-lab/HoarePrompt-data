The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a new string that is a concatenation of all unique characters from the initial string `s` in their original order, plus any characters that were not in the unique set initially, inserted at the beginning of the list.
