Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from user input, creates a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list is printed in the format [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 3, n-1, 1], where elements at even indices are in reverse order and elements at odd indices remain in their original positions. The function does not return any value. **
