Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` is not retained after each iteration.**
