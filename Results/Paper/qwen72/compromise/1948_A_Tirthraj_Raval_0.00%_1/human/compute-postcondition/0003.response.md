The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. `n` is an integer representing the number of special characters required in the string, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

The function returns a string containing exactly `n` special characters for each of the `t` test cases. If `t` is 1, the function returns a single string with `n` special characters. If `t` is greater than 1, the function returns a list of `t` strings, each containing exactly `n` special characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` is the number of special characters required in the string (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). It returns a string with exactly `n` special characters if `t` is 1, or a list of `t` strings, each containing exactly `n` special characters if `t` is greater than 1.**
