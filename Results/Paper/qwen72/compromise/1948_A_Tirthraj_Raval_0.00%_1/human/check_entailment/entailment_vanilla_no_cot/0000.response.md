Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., AA, BB).

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and constructs a string of length `n` with exactly `n` special characters. The pattern used is alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed using a loop that appends pairs of 'A' and 'B' characters to the list `pattern`. The expression `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` ensures that the characters alternate, and `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` ensures that the next character is the opposite of the current one. This results in a string like "ABABAB..." for even `n`.

5. **Output**: The constructed pattern is then joined into a string and printed.

The program adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem, ensuring that the output string is of length at most 200 and contains exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it correctly reports that no such string exists. Therefore, the program is correct.
