Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The issue lies in the way the function `func_1` constructs the sequence `nums`.

### Problem with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Distribution of Values**:
   - The code sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, if `k = 5` and `n = 2`, the correct output should be `5 0` or `4 1`, but the code will output `3 2`, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

2. **Sum Constraint**:
   - The code subtracts the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` from `k` for each element in the sequence, which can lead to negative values of `k` if `n` is large enough. This violates the constraint that the sum of the sequence should be equal to `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence, you should distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence such that each bit is set in at least one of the numbers. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(k.bit_length()):
        if k & (1 << i):
            nums[i % n] |= (1 << i)
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] += 1
            k -= 1
    return nums
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Bit Distribution**:
   - Iterate over each bit position of `k` from 0 to `k.bit_length() - 1`.
   - If the bit at position `i` is set in `k`, set the corresponding bit in `nums[i % n]`. This ensures that each bit is set in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

2. **Remaining Sum**:
   - After distributing the bits, if `k` is still greater than 0, distribute the remaining sum (which is the number of 1s that were not set in the initial distribution) across the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

### Example:
For `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
- The binary representation of `5` is `101`.
- The bits are distributed as follows:
  - Bit 0 (1) is set in `nums[0]`.
  - Bit 2 (4) is set in `nums[0]`.
- The sequence becomes `[5, 0]`, which is correct.

For `n = 6` and `k = 51`:
- The binary representation of `51` is `110011`.
- The bits are distributed as follows:
  - Bit 0 (1) is set in `nums[0]`.
  - Bit 1 (2) is set in `nums[1]`.
  - Bit 4 (16) is set in `nums[4]`.
  - Bit 5 (32) is set in `nums[5]`.
- The remaining sum is `51 - (1 + 2 + 16 + 32) = 0`, so no further adjustments are needed.
- The sequence becomes `[1, 2, 0, 0, 16, 32]`, which is correct.

This approach ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized while maintaining the sum constraint.
