Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates `n` times, setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This value is subtracted from `k` in each iteration.
   - Finally, the remaining value of `k` is added to the last element of the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` generates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit set in `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary 1010), `k.bit_length()` is 4, so `(1 << 3) - 1` is 7 (binary 111).
   - This approach ensures that each number in the sequence has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.
   - However, the function subtracts this value from `k` in each iteration, which can lead to negative values of `k` if `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is small. This is incorrect because `k` should always be non-negative.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is very small (e.g., 1) and `n` is greater than 1, the function will set each number in the sequence to 0 and then add `k` to the last number. This is incorrect because the sum of the sequence will not be `k` if `k` is subtracted multiple times.
   - If `n` is 1, the function will set the single number to `k`, which is correct because the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

5. **Ensuring the Sum**:
   - The function ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` by adding the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence. This is a valid approach if `k` remains non-negative throughout the iterations.
   - However, if `k` becomes negative, the sum of the sequence will not be `k`.

6. **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
   - By setting each number in the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the function ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible, assuming `k` remains non-negative.
   - If `k` becomes negative, the function's logic breaks down, and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is not maximized.

7. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the sequence into a string and appending it to the results list.
   - The results are then printed with each sequence on a new line.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `k` becomes negative during the iterations, leading to incorrect sums and potentially incorrect bitwise OR results.

Final: **False**
