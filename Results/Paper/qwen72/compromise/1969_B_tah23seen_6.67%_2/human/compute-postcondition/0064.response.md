Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is now `left + 1` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.**

Explanation:
- The value of `left` is incremented by 1, making it `left + 1`.
- The conditions regarding `sChar`, `s`, `right`, and `cost` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `left` is still less than `len(s)`.
- The relationship between `left` and `right` (where `left` is less than or equal to `right`) is maintained.
- The calculation of `cost` continues to be based on the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1, summed over each iteration.
