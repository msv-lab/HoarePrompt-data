To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is updated to `left + 1` and is less than `len(s)`.
   - Therefore, `left` is already within the bounds of `s`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` has been incremented, and `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s[left]` must not be '1'. Since `right` is the next index where a '0' exists, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `s[left]` should be a '0' (or some other character that is not '1').

Given these conditions, the loop can execute one more time if `left` is still less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `left` is already less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` should be a '0' (or another non-'1' character), no adjustments are needed.

State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is now `left + 1` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.**
