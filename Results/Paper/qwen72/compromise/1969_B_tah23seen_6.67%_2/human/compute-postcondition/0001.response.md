To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `sChar`.

- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one character.
- `i` is the variable that will take on each character value from `sChar` during each iteration of the loop.

Given that `sChar` is already defined as having a length of at least 2, it inherently meets the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start with the first character of `sChar`.

Since `s` is an empty list and not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the first character of `sChar`, `s` is an empty list**
