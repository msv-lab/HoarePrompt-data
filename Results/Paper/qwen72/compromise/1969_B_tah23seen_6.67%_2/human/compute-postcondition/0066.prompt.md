Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):
    if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
        s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
        cost += right - left + 1
    while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
        right += 1
    while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
        left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the last '1' in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no more '1's exist, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
