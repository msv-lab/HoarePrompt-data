Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is 3, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', and `s[2]` must not be '1'.** 

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
