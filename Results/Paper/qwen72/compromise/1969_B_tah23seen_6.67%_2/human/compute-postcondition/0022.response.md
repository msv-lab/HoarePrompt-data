Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2, and `s[1]` is '1'.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `right` until it finds the first '0' in the list `s` starting from index 1.
- If no '0' is found in the list `s` from index 1 onwards, `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`.
- The variable `left` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- The variable `cost` remains 2 throughout the loop.
- The character at index 1 in `s` is '1', which is a condition that was set before the loop started and remains unchanged.
- The loop does not modify any other elements in the list `s` except for the conditions specified in the problem statement.
