To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

- The current state indicates that `left` is 1, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
- For the loop to execute again, `left` must be less than `len(s)`, and the character at `s[left]` must not be '1'.

Given that `left` is 1, it is already less than `len(s)` (since `s` has a length of at least 2). Therefore, the primary condition to check is whether `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `right` is defined as the index of the first '0' starting from index 1, and `left` is 1, it implies that `s[left]` is either '0' or some other character (but not '1').

Thus, the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any state, as the conditions are already met.

State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is 1, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.**
