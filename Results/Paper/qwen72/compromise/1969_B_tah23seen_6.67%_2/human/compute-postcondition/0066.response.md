Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, but with all '1's moved to the front and all '0's moved to the back, `left` is equal to the number of '1's in `s`, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `cost` is the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.** 

### Explanation:
- **`sChar`**: The original binary string remains unchanged in terms of its length and content.
- **`s`**: The list `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar`, but the characters have been rearranged such that all '1's are moved to the front and all '0's are moved to the back.
- **`left`**: This variable ends up being the index of the first '0' in the rearranged list `s`, which is also the count of '1's in the original string.
- **`right`**: This variable ends up being `len(s)`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
- **`cost`**: This variable accumulates the total cost of swapping operations performed during the loop, calculated as the sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration.
