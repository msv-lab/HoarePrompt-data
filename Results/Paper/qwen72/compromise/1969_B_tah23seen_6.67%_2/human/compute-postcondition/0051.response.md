Postcondition: ***`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is an index where a '0' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`. If `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, then `left` is updated to an index where a '0' now exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to an index where a '1' now exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.***
