### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a line of slimes, each with a size. Every second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger. The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. It uses the `bisect_left` function to efficiently find this index.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, which is not relevant to the problem since `x` is always within the valid range.
   - If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index `inx` where `a[inx]` is the first element greater than `x`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten from the left side.
   - It initializes two lists: `left` to store cumulative sums and `last` to store the index of the last occurrence of each element up to the current index.
   - For each slime `i` (starting from 1 to `n-1`):
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it means the slime `i` can be eaten by `a[i-1]` in 1 second, so `ans[i]` is set to 1.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum up to `i-1` minus `a[i]` minus 1.
     - It then uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also uses the `last` list to find the index `inx2` of the last occurrence of `a[i-1]` up to `i-1`.
     - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
     - If `inx` is valid (not -1), it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.
   - The function returns the list `ans`.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and their sizes `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to get the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from either direction.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

### Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly finds the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
  - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in 1 second.
  - The cumulative sum list `left` and the `last` list are used to efficiently find the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten.
  - The logic for updating `ans[i]` based on `inx` and `inx2` is correct.

- **Main Program**:
  - The main program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It calls `func_2` twice to consider both directions (left and right).
  - It combines the results to get the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
  - The final output is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
