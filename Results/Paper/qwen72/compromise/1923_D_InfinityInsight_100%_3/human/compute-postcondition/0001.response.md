Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1.**

The code snippet `last = [-1]` initializes the list `last` with a single element, -1. The values of `a`, `n`, and `left` remain unchanged.
