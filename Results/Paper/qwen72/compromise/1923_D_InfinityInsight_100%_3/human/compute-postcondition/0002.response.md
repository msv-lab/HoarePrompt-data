Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1.**

The code initializes a new list `ans` with a length equal to `n`, and each element in the list is set to -1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) remain unchanged.
