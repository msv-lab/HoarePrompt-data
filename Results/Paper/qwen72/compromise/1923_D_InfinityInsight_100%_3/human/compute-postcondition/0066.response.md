The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies the constraint 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`. Each element in `ans` is set to `i + 1 - inx` for each index `i` where the condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx`. If the condition is not met, the element remains -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is `i + 1 - inx` if the condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx` for the index `i`, otherwise the element remains -1.**
