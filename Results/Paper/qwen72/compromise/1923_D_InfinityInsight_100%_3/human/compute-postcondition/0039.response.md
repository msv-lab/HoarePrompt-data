Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[0]`. If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `i + 1 - inx`.
- Since `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is set to `1 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `2 - inx`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
