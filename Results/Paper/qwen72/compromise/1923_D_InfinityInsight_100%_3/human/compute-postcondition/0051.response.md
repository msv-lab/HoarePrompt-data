Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`, and `ans[2]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`. `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` updates the value of `ans[2]` to `2 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `3 - inx`.
- The initial value of `ans[2]` was -1, but it is now updated to `3 - inx`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
