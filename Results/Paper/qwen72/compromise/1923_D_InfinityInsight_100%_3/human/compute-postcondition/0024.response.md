Output State: **`a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the last element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `a` is still a non-empty list, and `i` is now the last element of `a`.
- The list `last` remains unchanged, still holding the indices of the last occurrences of each element in `a` up to the current index.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged, with all elements still set to -1.
- The list `left` has grown to include `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index. The first element of `left` is the initial value, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the current element from `a`.
