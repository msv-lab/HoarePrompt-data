To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), representing the number of integers.
- The list of integers \(a_1, \ldots, a_n\) consists of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\).
- The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `times` is an integer input by the user.
- `check` is 2147483647.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(times):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and `times`.
- The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `times` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, ..., a_n`, `check`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
