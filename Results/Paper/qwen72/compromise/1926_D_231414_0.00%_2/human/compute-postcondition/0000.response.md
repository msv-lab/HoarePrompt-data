Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of integers. The list of integers a_1, ..., a_n consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. times is an integer input by the user.**
