Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if 4 * n - 2 == k` and the subsequent calculation `print(k // 2 + 1)` does not accurately handle the scenario where all diagonals need to be covered. Additionally, the general case `print(ceil(k / 2))` is not always correct for all values of `k`.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid. Each cell in the grid can be part of two diagonals: one from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonal) and one from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonal). Therefore, coloring a cell can cover at most two diagonals.

The minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals can be determined by the following logic:
- If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring \( k \) cells in a single row or column.
- If \( k \) is greater than \( n \), we need to color cells in both rows and columns to cover the remaining diagonals. The number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

However, there is a special case when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \). In this case, we need to color all cells in the grid, but the solution provided does not handle this correctly.

### Revised Program:
```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))

func()
```

This revised program correctly handles the cases where \( k \) is less than or equal to \( n \) and where \( k \) is greater than \( n \). It also avoids the incorrect special case handling for \( k = 4n - 2 \).
