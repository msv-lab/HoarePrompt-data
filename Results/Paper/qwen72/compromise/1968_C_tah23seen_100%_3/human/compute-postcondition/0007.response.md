Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and `i` is `n - 5` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 5`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
