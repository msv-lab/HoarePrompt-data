The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies the constraint 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged.
