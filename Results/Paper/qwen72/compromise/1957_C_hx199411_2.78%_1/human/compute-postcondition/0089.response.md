To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 as per the `range(k)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1 (this does not affect the loop execution directly)
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input (we need to ensure `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute)
- `num` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution directly)

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 0**
