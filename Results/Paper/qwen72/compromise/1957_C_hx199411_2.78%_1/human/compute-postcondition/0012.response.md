The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers from user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.**
