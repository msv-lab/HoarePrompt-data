Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where \( 0 < t \leq 10^4 - 1 \).
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- The current value of `m` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The value being printed is a constant integer `0`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(0)` statement will always print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, or `m`.

Output: **0**
