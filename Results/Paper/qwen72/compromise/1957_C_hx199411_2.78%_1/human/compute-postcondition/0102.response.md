The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `k`. However, it sets the stage for the subsequent condition that will determine the value of `num`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input.**
