Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last integer value provided by the user input, `k` is the last integer value provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program prints 0. If `m` is 1, the program prints 1. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the program prints `dp[m]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 each time it runs, and the loop stops when `t` reaches 0.
- **`n` and `k`**: These are the last values provided by the user input for the final test case.
- **`i`**: This is `k-1` because the inner loop iterates `k` times, and `i` is the loop variable.
- **`num`**: This is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop. For each pair `(c, r)`, if `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is incremented by 2.
- **`m`**: This is calculated as `n - num`.
- **`dp`**: If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros. The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are set to 1 and 3, respectively. For each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The final value of `dp[m]` is printed.

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
