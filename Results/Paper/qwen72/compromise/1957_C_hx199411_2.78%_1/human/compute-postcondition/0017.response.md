The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now 2), and for the loop to execute again, `k` must still be greater than `i` (so `k` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.**
