The provided code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This changes the values of `c` and `r` from their initial state (which were integers provided by the user input) to new values also provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are now the new integers provided by the user input, and `num` is set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is set to 2.**
