Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations the loop will run.
- The variable `i` ends up being `k-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`.
- The variable `num` accumulates the value of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Therefore, `num` is the sum of these increments over all `k` iterations.
