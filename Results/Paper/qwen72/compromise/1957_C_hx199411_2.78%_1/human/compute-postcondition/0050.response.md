Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is 1, `m` is `n`. Additionally, `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `c` is equal to `r` remains valid.
