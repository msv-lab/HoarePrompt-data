The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `num` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is increased by 2.**
