To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input.
- `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `dp[1]` is set to 1.
- `dp[2]` is set to 3.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(3, m + 1)` is not empty.
- For the range to be non-empty, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop iterator and will be automatically managed by the `range` function.
- The variable `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `dp[1]` is set to 1.
- `dp[2]` is set to 3.

### State:
**`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3**
