To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-zero integer where \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `k` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`.
   - `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - For each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to \((dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `k` are user inputs, but they do not directly affect the calculation of `dp[m]`.
   - `num` is a value derived from pairs `(c, r)`, but its exact value is not provided. However, it affects `m` which is `n - num`.
   - `m` must be at least 3, so `dp` will have at least 4 elements.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with zeros, and specific values are set for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The `dp` array is filled using the formula:
     \[
     dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula suggests a recursive relationship where each `dp[j]` depends on the previous two values `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]`.

4. **Final Value of `dp[m]`:**
   - The value of `dp[m]` is computed based on the above formula and the initial conditions.
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `num` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, we know that `dp[m]` will be the result of the dynamic programming calculation up to index `m`.

Given the initial state and the dynamic programming logic, the `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]` after the dynamic programming calculation is complete.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed by the dynamic programming formula for the given m, and m is n - num with m being at least 3)**
