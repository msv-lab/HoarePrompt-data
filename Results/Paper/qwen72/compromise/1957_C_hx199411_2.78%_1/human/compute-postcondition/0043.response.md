To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k-1`
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop
- `m` is `n - num`
- If `m` is 0, no further changes are made.
- If `m` is 1, `i` is `k-1`.
- If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, each calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration specifies that `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is non-zero. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `m`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made. If `m` is 1, `i` is `k-1`. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, each calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.
