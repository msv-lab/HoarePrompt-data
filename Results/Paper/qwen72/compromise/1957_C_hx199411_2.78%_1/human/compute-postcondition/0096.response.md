The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2.**
