Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `m - 1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `m - 1`, and the list `dp` will have been updated such that each element from index 3 to `m` follows the formula `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
