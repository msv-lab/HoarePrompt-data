Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`.***
