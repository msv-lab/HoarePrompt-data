Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The value of `1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **1**
