Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial moves (r, c) and (c, r) are such that they do not overlap with any previously placed rooks. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of configurations by only considering the number of overlapping moves (where `r == c`), and it does not account for the remaining positions on the board where rooks can still be placed without attacking each other.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
The program will output `3`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider a more complex case:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
Here, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` because after the initial moves, there are still three possible configurations for placing the remaining rooks:

1. Place a white rook at (3, 4) and a black rook at (4, 3).
2. Place a white rook at (4, 3) and a black rook at (3, 4).
3. Place a white rook at (3, 3) and a black rook at (4, 4).

The program fails to correctly calculate the number of configurations in this and similar cases.
