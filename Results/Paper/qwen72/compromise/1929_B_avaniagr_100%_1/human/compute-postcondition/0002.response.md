Output State: **The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop iterates over the input test cases and prints the calculated values based on the conditions provided. The variables `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration according to the input test cases, but they are not stored or returned by the function. The state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
