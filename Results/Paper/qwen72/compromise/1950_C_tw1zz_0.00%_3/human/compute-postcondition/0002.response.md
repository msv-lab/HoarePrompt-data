The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 to 1440. `s` is a string representing a time in 24-hour format, "hh:mm", where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The input string `s` is always a valid time.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It processes `t` test cases, each with a valid time string `s`, and returns the processed results for each test case.**
