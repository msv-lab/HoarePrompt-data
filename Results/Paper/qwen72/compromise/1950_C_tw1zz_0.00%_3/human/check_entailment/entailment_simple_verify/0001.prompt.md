You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the input time in 24-hour format will be converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and printed. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their values will not persist outside the loop. After all iterations, the loop will have completed and the program will terminate.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format using `input().split(':')`, which splits the input string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour `h` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets `h1` to the same value and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including `00:00` and `12:00`.

5. **General Validity**:
   - The program assumes valid inputs as described in the problem statement, which is reasonable.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly convert the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handle all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
