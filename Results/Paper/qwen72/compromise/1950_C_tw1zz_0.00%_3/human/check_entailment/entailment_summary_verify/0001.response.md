Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format using `input().split(':')`, which splits the input string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour `h` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets `h1` to the same value and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`. However, this is incorrect. According to the 12-hour format, `12:00` should be `12:00 PM`, not `12:00 AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles most edge cases correctly, including `00:00` and `12:00` (except for the incorrect handling of `12:00` as `AM` instead of `PM`).

5. **General Validity**:
   - The program assumes valid inputs as described in the problem statement, which is reasonable.
   - However, the incorrect handling of `12:00` as `AM` instead of `PM` is a significant error that affects the correctness of the program.

Given the above points, the program is mostly correct but has a critical error in handling the `12:00` case.

Final: **False**
