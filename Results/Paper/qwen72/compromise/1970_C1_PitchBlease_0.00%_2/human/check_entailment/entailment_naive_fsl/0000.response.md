Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting node is one of the leaves. In such a case, the player who starts (Ron) would immediately lose because there is no inactive neighbor to move to. However, the current implementation will still compute the distances to the other leaves and incorrectly determine the winner based on those distances.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
In this case, the starting node is one of the leaves (node 1). The program will still compute the distances from node 1 to the other leaves and return "Ron" or "Hermione" based on those distances, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "Hermione" because Ron cannot make a move and loses immediately.
