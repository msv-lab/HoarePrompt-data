The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tree[current]` and the `neighbor` variable. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must contain at least one more element that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and the loop has processed one of those elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, and `neighbor` will be set to the next element in `tree[current]`.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it must contain at least one element but the first element has been removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, including `current`. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not been processed.**
