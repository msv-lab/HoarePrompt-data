Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing the integers `start` and `neighbor`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is in the `visited` set.**
