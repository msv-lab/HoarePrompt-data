The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over all elements in `tree[current]`. At the end of the last iteration, `neighbor` was the next element in `tree[current]` that had not been processed, and `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `neighbor` must be set to the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`, and `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element that has not been processed.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it now contains at least one element but the first element has been removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, including `current`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is also added to `visited`. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not been processed.**
