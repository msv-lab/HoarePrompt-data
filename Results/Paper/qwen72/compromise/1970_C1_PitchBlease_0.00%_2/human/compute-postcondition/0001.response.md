Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

The initial state is updated to include the set `visited` which now contains the integer `start`. All other variables remain unchanged.
