Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `tree[start]` must have at least one more neighbor, `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set, and the tuple `(neighbor, 1)` has been appended to the `queue`.**
