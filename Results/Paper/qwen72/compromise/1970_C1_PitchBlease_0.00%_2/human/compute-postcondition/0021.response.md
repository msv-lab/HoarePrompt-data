The variable in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially and must contain at least one element. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.**
