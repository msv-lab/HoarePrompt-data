Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is still a dictionary representing the graph. `queue` is now an empty deque, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, which includes all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If `target` was found, the function returned the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph. If `target` was not found, the function exits the loop without returning a distance, and `current` and `dist` will be the last processed node and its distance from `start`, respectively.**
