Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is still a dictionary representing the graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed, with their respective distances from `start`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph. If `current` does not equal `target` and the `queue` is empty, the function will exit the loop without finding the `target`.**
