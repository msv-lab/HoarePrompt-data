#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and represents the edges of the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and represents the edges of the tree, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game, `tree` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and for each tuple (u, v) in `edges`, `tree[u]` includes `v` as an additional element, and `tree[v]` includes `u` as an additional element.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` list, identifies the leaf nodes, and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaf nodes. The function returns 'Ron' if the distance to either of the first two leaf nodes is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers such that 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is still a dictionary representing the graph. `queue` is now an empty deque, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, which includes all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If `target` was found, the function returned the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph. If `target` was not found, the function exits the loop without returning a distance, and `current` and `dist` will be the last processed node and its distance from `start`, respectively.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the graph, and the search concluded without finding a path from the start node to the target node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, and a dictionary `tree` representing a graph. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node in the graph. If the `target` node is found, the function returns the shortest path distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, the function returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node. The function does not modify the `tree` dictionary or the `start` and `target` integers.
