Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given the distribution of cards. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of integers representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list `a` and the integer `n`.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and populates `count_a` with the count of each integer.
   - It initializes `max_score` to 0.
   - It iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in `a`. If it does, it increments `max_score` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns `max_score`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Counting Occurrences**:
  - The dictionary `count_a` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

- **Calculating Maximum Score**:
  - The program iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in `a`.
  - If an integer appears exactly twice, it means you have both cards of that integer, and you can score a point when you play the second card if Nene has not already played the matching card.
  - However, the program does not consider the optimal play strategy of Nene, which is crucial for determining the maximum score you can achieve.

### Optimal Play Strategy:

- **Your Strategy**:
  - You should play the cards that appear exactly twice in `a` as late as possible to maximize the chance that Nene has not played the matching card.
  - If an integer appears only once in `a`, you cannot score a point for that integer.

- **Nene's Strategy**:
  - Nene will always play the matching card as soon as possible to minimize your score.
  - If Nene has a card that matches one of your cards, she will play it immediately to prevent you from scoring a point.

### Correctness of the Program:

- The program correctly identifies the integers that appear exactly twice in `a`.
- However, it does not account for the optimal play strategy of Nene, which is essential for determining the maximum score you can achieve.
- The program assumes that you can always score a point for each integer that appears exactly twice in `a`, which is not necessarily true if Nene plays optimally.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal play strategy of Nene, which is a critical part of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
