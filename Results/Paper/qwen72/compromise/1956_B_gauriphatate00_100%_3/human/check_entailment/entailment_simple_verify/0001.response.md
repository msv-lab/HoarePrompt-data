### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed between you and Nene, each receiving n cards.
   - The goal is to maximize your score by playing optimally, given that Nene will also play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If you have a card with an integer x that appears twice in your hand, you can play one of these cards and score a point when you play the second card.
   - Nene, being optimal, will always play a card that does not give you a point if she has a choice. Therefore, if you have a card x that appears only once in your hand, Nene will play the second card x before you, ensuring you do not score a point for that card.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, n)` to compute the maximum score you can achieve.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to n and checks if it appears twice in your hand. If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It correctly identifies the integers that appear twice in your hand and increments the score for each such integer.
   - The program does not explicitly account for the optimal play of Nene, but it implicitly does so by only counting the integers that appear twice in your hand. This is because if an integer appears only once in your hand, Nene will play the second card before you, and you will not score a point for that integer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where an integer appears only once in your hand by not incrementing the score for that integer.
   - The program also handles the case where an integer does not appear in your hand at all by not incrementing the score for that integer.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene will also play optimally. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
