The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will be set to the first element of the list `a` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
- `count_a` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `a` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` must be at least 1, `num` is the first element of `a`, each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`, `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**
