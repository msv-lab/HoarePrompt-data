Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers a, b, and c from the input. Depending on the values of a, b, and c, it will print 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of a, b, and c will be updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be the values read in the last iteration. The value of t will remain unchanged.**
