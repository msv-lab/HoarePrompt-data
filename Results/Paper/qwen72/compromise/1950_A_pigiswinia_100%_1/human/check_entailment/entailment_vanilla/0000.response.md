### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It then checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should correctly output "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are not in a strict increasing or decreasing order, which should correctly output "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are `1 <= t <= 1000` and `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`, which are respected by the program's input handling.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
