The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `p`. The loop iterates over each character in `p`, so the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next character in `p` for the loop to execute one more time. The string `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some character in `p`.

To determine the next state, we need to identify the current character of `i` and then set it to the next character in `p`. Since `p` is a fixed string, we can assume that `i` will be the next character in the sequence 'ABCDEFG'.

For example, if `i` was 'A' at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 'B' at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 'F', it will be 'G'. If `i` was 'G', the loop will not execute again because 'G' is the last character in `p`.

However, the exact current value of `i` is not provided, so we will generalize the state adjustment:

- If `i` is 'A', the next `i` will be 'B'.
- If `i` is 'B', the next `i` will be 'C'.
- If `i` is 'C', the next `i` will be 'D'.
- If `i` is 'D', the next `i` will be 'E'.
- If `i` is 'E', the next `i` will be 'F'.
- If `i` is 'F', the next `i` will be 'G'.
- If `i` is 'G', the loop will not execute again.

Given that `i` is some character in `p` at the end of the previous iteration, the next state will be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, and `i` is the next character in the sequence 'ABCDEFG'**.
