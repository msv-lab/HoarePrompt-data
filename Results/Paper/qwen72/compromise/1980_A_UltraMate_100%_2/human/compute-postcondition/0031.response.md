Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is increased by the total of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`, `_` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are now assigned the input integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
