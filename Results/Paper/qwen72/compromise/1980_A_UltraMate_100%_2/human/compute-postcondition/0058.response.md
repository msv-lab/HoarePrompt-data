Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this value is not directly used in the code snippet).
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object with the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `_` is incremented by the number of key-value pairs in `hmp` (this value is not directly used in the code snippet).
- `ans` is calculated as follows:
  - The total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum.
  - Plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`hmp` Calculation**:
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "ABCD"`, then `hmp` will be `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`.

2. **`ans` Calculation**:
   - `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG', which contains 7 characters.
   - We need to count how many characters in `p` are not in `hmp` and each of these characters will contribute `m` to `ans`.
   - For each character `i` in `hmp` that is also in `p` and has a count less than `m`, we add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `s = "ABCD"`, `m = 3`.
   - `hmp` will be `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`.
   - Characters in `p` not in `hmp` are `E`, `F`, and `G`. Each of these characters contributes `m` to `ans`, so `3 * 3 = 9`.
   - For characters in `hmp` that are also in `p` and have a count less than `m`:
     - `A` contributes `3 - 1 = 2`.
     - `B` contributes `3 - 1 = 2`.
     - `C` contributes `3 - 1 = 2`.
     - `D` contributes `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - Sum of these contributions: `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8`.
   - Total `ans` is `9 + 8 = 17`.

### General Description:
- `ans` is the sum of:
  - `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`.
  - `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` that is also in `p` and has a count less than `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`)**.
