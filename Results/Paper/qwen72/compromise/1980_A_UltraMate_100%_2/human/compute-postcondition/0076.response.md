The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the object `hmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `hmp`. If `hmp` is not empty, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. For the loop to execute, `hmp` must have at least one key (i.e., at least one character in `s`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `hmp` is not empty and that `i` is the first key in `hmp`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s` that must have at least one key, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 7, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`**
