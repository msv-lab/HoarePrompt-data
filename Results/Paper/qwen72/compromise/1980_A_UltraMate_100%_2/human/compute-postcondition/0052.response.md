Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the difference `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
