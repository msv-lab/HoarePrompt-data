Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are now assigned the input integers provided by the user.
- The initial state of `t` being greater than 0, `s` being an input string, `p` being 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` being a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` being incremented by 1, and `ans` being the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, remain unchanged.
