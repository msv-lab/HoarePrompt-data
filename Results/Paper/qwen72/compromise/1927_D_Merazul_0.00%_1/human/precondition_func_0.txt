t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) queries. Each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
