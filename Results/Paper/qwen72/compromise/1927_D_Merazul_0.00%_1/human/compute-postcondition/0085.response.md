To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `f` is `1` if every integer from `1` to `k` is in either `a` or `b`, otherwise `0`
   - `m` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers from `1` to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`
   - `n` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers from `1` to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses a string slicing technique: `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`
   - Let's break down the expression inside the brackets:
     - `f ^ 1` is the bitwise XOR operation. If `f` is `1`, then `f ^ 1` is `0`. If `f` is `0`, then `f ^ 1` is `1`.
     - `m | n < 0` is the bitwise OR operation. This part is a bit tricky because of the operator precedence. The expression `m | n < 0` is evaluated as `m | (n < 0)`. Since `n < 0` is a boolean, it will be `0` if `n` is non-negative and `1` if `n` is negative.
     - The `or` operator returns the first truthy value or the last value if none are truthy. So, `f ^ 1 or m | (n < 0)` will evaluate to:
       - `0` if `f` is `1` and `m | (n < 0)` is `0`
       - `1` if `f` is `0` or `m | (n < 0)` is `1`

3. **String slicing:**
   - The string `'YNEOS'` is sliced based on the value of the expression `f ^ 1 or m | (n < 0)`.
   - If the expression evaluates to `0`, the slice `::2` will start from index `0` and take every second character: `'YNEOS'[0::2]` results in `'YEO'`.
   - If the expression evaluates to `1`, the slice `::2` will start from index `1` and take every second character: `'YNEOS'[1::2]` results in `'NN'`.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - If `f` is `1` (every integer from `1` to `k` is in either `a` or `b`), then `f ^ 1` is `0`. The expression `0 or m | (n < 0)` will be `0` if `m | (n < 0)` is `0`, and `1` if `m | (n < 0)` is `1`.
     - If `m` and `n` are both non-negative, then `m | (n < 0)` is `0`, and the output will be `'YEO'`.
     - If `m` is negative or `n` is negative, then `m | (n < 0)` is `1`, and the output will be `'NN'`.
   - If `f` is `0` (not every integer from `1` to `k` is in either `a` or `b`), then `f ^ 1` is `1`. The expression `1 or m | (n < 0)` will always be `1`, and the output will be `'NN'`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:

- **'YEO'** if every integer from `1` to `k` is in either `a` or `b` and both `m` and `n` are non-negative.
- **'NN'** otherwise.

Output: **'YEO' if every integer from 1 to k is in either a or b and both m and n are non-negative, otherwise 'NN'**
