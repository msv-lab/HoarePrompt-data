Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is now `t - 1`, representing the number of remaining test cases. Each test case still contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) queries. Each query is still defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `R` is still a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers. `k` is the last integer in the iterator returned by `R()`. `a` is a set containing the integers read from the input for the current test case. `b` is a set containing the integers read from the input for the current test case. `f` is 1.**
