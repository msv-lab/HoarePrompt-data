To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head condition: `low + 1 < high`.

### Initial State:
- `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`.
   - Substituting the initial values: `0 + 1 < n - 1`.
   - Simplifying: `1 < n - 1`.
   - Further simplifying: `2 < n`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
