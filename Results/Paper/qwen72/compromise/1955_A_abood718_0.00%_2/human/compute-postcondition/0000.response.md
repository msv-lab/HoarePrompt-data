The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly set before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
