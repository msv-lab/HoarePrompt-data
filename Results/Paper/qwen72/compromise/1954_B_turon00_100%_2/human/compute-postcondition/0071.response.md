Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and the element at index `i` of the list `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Since `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 0. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, the minimum of `n` and 0 is 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
