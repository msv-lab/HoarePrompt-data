Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is assigned the value 0.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` is not provided, so it remains as "incremented by 1."
- `n` is still greater than 0 and must be greater than the new value of `i`.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, which is now 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0.
