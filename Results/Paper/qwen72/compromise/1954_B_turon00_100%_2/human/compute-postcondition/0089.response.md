To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from the end of the list `a` to the beginning, checking for consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `cnt` is updated to count these consecutive elements.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

4. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - Since `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`, it will be a value that is less than `n` (as `ans` is not equal to `n`).
   - The value of `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the loop execution, the output will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the list `a` found in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the list `a` found in the list `a`)**
