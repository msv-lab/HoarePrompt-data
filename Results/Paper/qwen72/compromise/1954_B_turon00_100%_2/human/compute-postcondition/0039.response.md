The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The other conditions (`n` must be greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
