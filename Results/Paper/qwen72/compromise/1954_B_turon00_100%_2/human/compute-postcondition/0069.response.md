Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `tmp`.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
