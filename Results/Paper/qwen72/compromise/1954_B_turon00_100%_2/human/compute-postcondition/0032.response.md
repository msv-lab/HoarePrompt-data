Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
