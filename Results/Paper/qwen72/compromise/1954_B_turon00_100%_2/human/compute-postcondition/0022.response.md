Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

The value of `cnt` is reset to 0, but since it was already 0 in the initial state, no change is observed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
