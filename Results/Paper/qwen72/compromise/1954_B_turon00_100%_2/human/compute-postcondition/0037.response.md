To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop uses `i` as the loop variable, and it will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head since `i` is redefined by the `range(n)` function at the start of each iteration.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because `range(n)` will produce an empty range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user (not relevant to the loop head)
- `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the new list `a` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (will be redefined by the loop)
- `cnt` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `ans` is `n` (not relevant to the loop head)

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
