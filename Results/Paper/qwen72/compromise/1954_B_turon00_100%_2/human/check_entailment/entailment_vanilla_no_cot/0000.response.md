Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`). However, this approach does not consider the structure of the beautiful array, which allows operations based on the condition `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. The program should instead focus on identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**: The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element by printing `-1`.

3. **Handling of Arrays with All Elements the Same**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.

4. **General Case**: For arrays where not all elements are the same, the program's logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It should consider the positions where the array can be broken to stop being beautiful, which involves more complex logic than just counting consecutive elements.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the positions where the array can be broken to stop being beautiful by ensuring that no valid `i` exists such that `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        if n == 1 or len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
            else:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 2)
        
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property by iterating through the array and looking for positions where `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. If such a position exists, it can be broken by removing one element. If no such position exists, it can be broken by removing two elements. If the array cannot be broken, it prints `-1`.
