### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array length \( n \) and an array \( a \).
   - The output should be the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case, or -1 if it's impossible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the array length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` for consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - If the array length \( n \) is 1 or `ans` is equal to \( n \), it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( n = 1 \) by printing -1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing -1.
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element, which is a reasonable approach to identify the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty condition.
   - However, the program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which might not be sufficient. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output 1 because it only checks for consecutive `1`s, but the correct answer is 1 (removing the last `1`).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array is already non-beautiful (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one unique element (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which might not be the optimal approach. It should consider all possible segments of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output 1 (which is correct), but it might fail in more complex cases where the first element is not the key to breaking the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect because it only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not a comprehensive approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program fails to consider other segments of consecutive elements that might be more optimal for breaking the beauty condition.

Final: **False**
