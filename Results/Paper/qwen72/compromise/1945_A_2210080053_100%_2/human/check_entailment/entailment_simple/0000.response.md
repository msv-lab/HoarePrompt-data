### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input (stdin). It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Logic for Tents Calculation:**
   - The program increments `b` by `c`, which means it considers all universals as potential extroverts. This is incorrect because universals can be used to fill any role, not just as extroverts.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents needed. This expression is intended to account for the fact that each introvert needs a tent alone, and each tent can hold up to 3 people. However, the use of `- -b // 3` is problematic and does not correctly handle the logic for distributing extroverts and universals.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` is used to determine if it is impossible to accommodate all participants. If `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent, so `a` tents are needed for introverts.
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly 2 others. If there are `b` extroverts, we need `b` to be a multiple of 3 for them to be accommodated. If `b % 3 != 0`, we need to use universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, then `b // 3` tents are needed for extroverts.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If `c >= b % 3`, we can use `b // 3` tents for extroverts and `c - b % 3` universals to fill the remaining spots. If `c < b % 3`, it is impossible to accommodate all participants, and the program should output `-1`.
   - The remaining universals can be accommodated in the minimum number of tents. If `c - b % 3` is the number of remaining universals, the number of tents needed for them is `(c - b % 3 + 2) // 3`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The expression `b += c` is incorrect because it assumes all universals are extroverts, which is not the case.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is incorrect and does not correctly calculate the number of tents needed. It should be `a + b // 3 + (c - b % 3 + 2) // 3` if `c >= b % 3`, otherwise `-1`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the distribution of universals and extroverts, and the logic for calculating the number of tents is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
