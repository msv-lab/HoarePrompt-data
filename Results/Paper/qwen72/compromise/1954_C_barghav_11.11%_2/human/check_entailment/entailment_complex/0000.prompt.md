Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same number of digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: The first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `a` will contain the minimum values. Conversely, the first half of the list `b` will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `b` will contain the maximum values. The length of both lists remains the same, and the number of test cases `t` is unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop prints the elements of the first half of list `a` which contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, followed by the elements of the second half of list `a` which contain the minimum values. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their values and lengths, and the number of test cases `t` is also unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop prints all elements of list `b` in sequence, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their values and lengths, and the number of test cases `t` is also unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a list of digits (1-9) of the same length. The function then modifies these lists such that the first half of the first list contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the two lists, and the second half contains the minimum values. Conversely, the first half of the second list contains the minimum values, and the second half contains the maximum values. After processing, the function prints the modified first list, followed by a blank line, and then the modified second list, each on a new line. The number of test cases `t` is not handled within this function.
