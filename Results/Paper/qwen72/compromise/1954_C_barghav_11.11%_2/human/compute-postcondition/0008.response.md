The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `b`. If `b` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and this is the state at the start of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 1 element, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`a` and `b` are lists where `b` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `t` is unchanged**
