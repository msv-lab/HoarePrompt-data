Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. Additionally, `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list.
- The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- If `n` is not 1, `ans` is updated to a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
- `temp` is set to \(2^i\).
- All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
