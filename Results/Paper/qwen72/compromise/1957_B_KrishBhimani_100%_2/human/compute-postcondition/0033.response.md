Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `k`. If `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.***
