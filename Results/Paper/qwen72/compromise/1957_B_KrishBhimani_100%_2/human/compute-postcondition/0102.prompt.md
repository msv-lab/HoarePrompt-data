You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. If `n` is 1, the output for that test case is `k`, and `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, the output for that test case is a list of length `n` containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. The variable `temp` is \(2^i\) for each test case where `n` is not 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it returns or prints a list of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
