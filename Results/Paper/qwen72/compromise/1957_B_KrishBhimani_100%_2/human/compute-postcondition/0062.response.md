The code snippet `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, and `temp` is \(2^i\). The value `(1 << i)` is equivalent to \(2^i\), and subtracting 1 from it gives \(2^i - 1\).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`
- `temp` is \(2^i\)

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` now contains the value \((2^i - 1)\)
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value \((2^i - 1)\), `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, `temp` is \(2^i\).**
