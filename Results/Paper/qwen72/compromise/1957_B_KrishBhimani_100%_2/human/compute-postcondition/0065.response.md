The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending zeros until its length matches `n`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The length of `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The current length of `ans` is 2 (since it contains two elements: \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\)).
   - The number of zeros to append is `n - len(ans)`, which is `n - 2`.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `ans` will now have `n` elements, where the first two elements are \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\), and the remaining elements are zeros.

5. **Output State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\), \((k - 2^i + 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\), \((k - 2^i + 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, `temp` is \(2^i\).**
