The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is set to 1 if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `i` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the value of `i` will depend on the initial condition.

If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` was initially 1, and after incrementing, `i` becomes 2. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k`, then `i` was initially 0, and after incrementing, `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1, `temp` is now `temp * 2`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
