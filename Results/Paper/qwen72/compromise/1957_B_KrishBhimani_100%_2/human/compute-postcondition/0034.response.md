The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run a certain number of times specified by `int(input())`. The loop does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, or `ans` for its execution condition. The loop will execute a fixed number of times regardless of these variables.

Since the loop is controlled by the input value, and the state at the end of the previous iteration does not affect the loop's continuation, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only contains the loop counter `_`, we can infer that the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list if `n` is not equal to 1, `k0` is equal to `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, and `_` is incremented by 1**.
