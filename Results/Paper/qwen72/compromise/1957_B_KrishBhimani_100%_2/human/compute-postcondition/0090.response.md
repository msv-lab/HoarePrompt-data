The value of `temp` is doubled due to the operation `temp *= 2`. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on the updated value of `temp`. Since the initial value of `temp` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after the multiplication, but we know it has been doubled.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is doubled.**
