Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, and `_` is incremented by 1.**
