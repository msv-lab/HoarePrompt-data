The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `l1`. This changes the value of `l1` from its initial state to a new list of strings.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are now the integer values of the first and second elements of the new `l1`, respectively.
- `arr` remains an empty list if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `k0` remains equal to `k` if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` remains a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k` if `n` is not equal to 1.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list if `n` is not equal to 1, `k0` is equal to `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k` if `n` is not equal to 1, and `_` is incremented by 1.**
