The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the parameter `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop's continuation depends on whether `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m-3`, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Since `_` was `m-3` at the end of the last iteration, incrementing `_` by 1 gives us `m-2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than `m-2`.

State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` for any tuple in `val`, the program prints 'no' and exits the loop. If all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition, the program prints 'yes'.**
