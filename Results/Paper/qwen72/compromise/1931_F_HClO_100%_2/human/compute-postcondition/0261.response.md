Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and moves to the next iteration.**
