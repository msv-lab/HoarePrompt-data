Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`. `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input. `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is `m-3`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, the program continues with the next steps in the loop.***
