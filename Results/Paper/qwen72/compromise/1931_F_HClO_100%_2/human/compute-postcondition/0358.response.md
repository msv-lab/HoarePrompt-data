Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` is the first integer from another new user input (if applicable), `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input (if applicable), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2` and `l` is now equal to `l1`. Otherwise, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `n - 2` and `l` is now equal to `l1`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `n - 2` and `l` is now a reference to `l2`.***
