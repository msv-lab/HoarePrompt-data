The code appends a tuple containing the value of `a3` and the list `l3` to the list `val`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `val`, we assume it is an existing list before this operation.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element.**
