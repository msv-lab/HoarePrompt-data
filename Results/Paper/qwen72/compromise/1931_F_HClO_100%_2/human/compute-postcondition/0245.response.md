Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 2.
- `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
- `a3` is the first integer from the input for the first iteration.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input for the first iteration.
- `val` is no longer an empty list but contains `m-2` elements.
- The list `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- It directly prints the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **no**
