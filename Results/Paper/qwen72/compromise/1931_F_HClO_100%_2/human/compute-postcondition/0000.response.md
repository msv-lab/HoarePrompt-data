Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5), where n is the number of chat participants and k is the number of participants who posted screenshots. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are distinct), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different.**
