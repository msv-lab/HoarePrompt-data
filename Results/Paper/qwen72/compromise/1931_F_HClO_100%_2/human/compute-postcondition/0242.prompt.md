Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `l1` is updated by inserting `a1` at the position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values, and `val` is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element, and `val` has one more element than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element, and `val` has one more element than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
