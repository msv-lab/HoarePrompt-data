Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed:

1. **Loop Completion**: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`.

2. **Conditions for `idx1` and `idx2`**:
   - If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx2` is set to `n-2`.
   - If `idx1` was initially -1 and `idx2` was a non-negative integer, then `idx1` is set to `n-2`, `idx2` remains a non-negative integer, and `p2` is set to 1.
   - If `l2[i + p2] == a1` was true for any `i`, then `idx2` is set to that `i` value, and `p2` is set to 1.
   - If none of the conditions involving `l1[i + p1] == a2` were met throughout the loop, `idx1` remains -1, and `p1` remains 0.

3. **Final Conditions**:
   - `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.
   - The value of `m` is 2.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible values of `idx1` and `idx2`:

- If `idx1` is not -1, then `idx2` must be `n-2` (since `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` and not greater than `idx2`).
- If `idx1` is -1, then `idx2` must also be -1 (since `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`).

However, the condition `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` and not greater than `idx2` implies that `idx1` and `idx2` must be equal. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that both `idx1` and `idx2` are `n-2`.

Given this, the `print('yes')` statement will execute without any dependency on the values of `idx1` and `idx2` or any other variables. The statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
