The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be at least 3, because `m - 2` would then be at least 1.

State: **`m` is at least 3, and user input has been consumed.**
