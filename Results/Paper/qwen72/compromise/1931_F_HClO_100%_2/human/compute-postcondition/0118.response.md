Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is `m-3`, where `m` is at least 3.
2. `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val`.
3. `val` is a list containing at least one tuple.
4. The list `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'no'`.
- The initial state provides information about variables and lists, but none of this information affects the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'no'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the contents of the lists mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **no**
