The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n - 1` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`**.
