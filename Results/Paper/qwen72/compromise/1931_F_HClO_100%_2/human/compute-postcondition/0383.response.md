Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. The loop has iterated through all tuples in `val`, and for each tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l3` was equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`. The loop completes without breaking, and the final output is 'yes'.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has successfully checked all tuples in the list `val`. For each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, the list `l3` matched the list of elements from `l` excluding the element `a3`. Since no mismatches were found, the loop completed its execution, and the final output is 'yes'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
