The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `idx1`. Given that `i` is 1, `idx1` will also be 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
