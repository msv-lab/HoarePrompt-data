The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder indicating the number of times the loop should run. The loop runs based on the value of `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `m - 2 > 0` must hold true, meaning `m` must be greater than 2. However, since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `m` must be greater than 3, this condition is already satisfied.

Given that the loop uses `m - 2` to determine the number of iterations, and `m` is greater than 3, the loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is positive. Since the loop does not modify `m`, the state of `m` remains unchanged. The placeholder `_` is incremented implicitly by the loop mechanism, but it is not a state that we track explicitly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for all variables except for the implicit increment of the loop counter (which is not tracked in the state).

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element, and `val` has one more element than before.**
