To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
- The program prints 'yes'.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`.
- `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input.
- `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3, and `_` should start at 0 (as it is typically used as an iterator variable in Python loops).

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 0**
