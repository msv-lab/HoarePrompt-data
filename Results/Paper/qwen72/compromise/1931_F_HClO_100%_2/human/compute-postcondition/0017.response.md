The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `m`. The loop can execute if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `_ < m - 2` to hold true.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than 2, `l11` and `l22` are not equal**
