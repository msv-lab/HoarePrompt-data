### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program correctly prints "yes" because a single screenshot always corresponds to some order.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the author and the order of participants.
   - It then checks if the lists `l11` and `l22` (which exclude the author of the other screenshot) are equal. If they are not, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.
   - If they are equal, it proceeds to find the positions of the authors in the lists `l1` and `l2`.

4. **Finding Positions of Authors:**
   - The program iterates through the lists to find the positions where the authors of the screenshots appear.
   - It handles the cases where one author appears before the other and adjusts the lists accordingly.

5. **Handling Remaining Screenshots:**
   - For the remaining screenshots, it checks if the order of participants matches the adjusted list `l`.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no".
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `m` is 2 or when the authors of the screenshots are in different positions.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given constraints and edge cases. It follows the logic required to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that all screenshots could correspond to.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
