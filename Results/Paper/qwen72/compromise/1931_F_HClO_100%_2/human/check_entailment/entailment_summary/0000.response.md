### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the function immediately prints 'yes' because a single screenshot can always be consistent with itself.

2. **Comparing First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and checks if they can be made consistent by removing the author of the other screenshot from each list.
   - If the lists `l11` and `l22` (which exclude the author of the other screenshot) are not equal, the function prints 'no' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding Insertion Points:**
   - The function then tries to find the positions where the authors of the first two screenshots should be inserted into each other's lists to make them consistent.
   - It iterates through the lists to find the indices `idx1` and `idx2` where the authors can be inserted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If one index is found and the other is not, the missing index is set to `n-2` (the second-to-last position).
   - If both indices are found, the function decides which list to modify based on the relative positions of the authors in the third screenshot (if available).

5. **Checking Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The function then checks the remaining screenshots to ensure they are consistent with the modified list.
   - If any screenshot is inconsistent, the function prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots are consistent, the function prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It checks the consistency of the screenshots and handles edge cases appropriately. The logic for finding insertion points and checking consistency is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
