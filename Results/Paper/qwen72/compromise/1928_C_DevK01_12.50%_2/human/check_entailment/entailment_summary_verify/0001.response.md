### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining how many different values of \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) can fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received.
   - The pattern of numbers repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions, and the pattern can be broken down into two segments: the first \(k\) positions and the next \(k-2\) positions.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - Each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(x\).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), the position \(n\) can be expressed as \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + r\), where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(r\) is the remainder.
   - The remainder \(r\) must be within the valid range for the pattern to fit.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The pattern can be described as:
     - For the first \(k\) positions: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - For the next \(k-2\) positions: \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\)
   - This means that for a given \(n\) and \(x\), \(n\) must be congruent to \(x\) modulo \(2k - 2\) or \(n\) must be congruent to \(2k - x\) modulo \(2k - 2\).

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - It checks if \(y\) is odd. If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \(q = (y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find possible values of \(k\).
   - It also checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional possible values of \(k\).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

6. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It first checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). This check is not necessary for finding all divisors.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \(q\) and checks if they are divisors of \(q\).
   - If a divisor is found, it adds it to the list \(M\).
   - It also adds the quotient \(q // i\) to the list if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

7. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd by printing 0.
   - The logic for finding divisors in `func_1` is correct, but the square root check is unnecessary and can be simplified.
   - The program correctly combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
   - The program correctly prints the number of unique values of \(k\).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem constraints. However, the square root check in `func_1` is not necessary and can be simplified. Despite this, the program's overall logic and implementation are correct and will produce the correct output for valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**

The given program is correct.
