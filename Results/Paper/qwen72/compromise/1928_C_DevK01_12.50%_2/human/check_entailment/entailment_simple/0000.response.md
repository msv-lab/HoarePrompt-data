### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a pattern in which the line of students is numbered in a specific way. The pattern repeats every \(2k-2\) positions, and the numbers assigned to the students follow a sequence of increasing and then decreasing values.
   - We need to determine how many values of \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) fit the given position \(n\) and the number \(x\) received by Vasya.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).
   - It calculates \(y = n + x\) and checks if \(y\) is odd. If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because no valid \(k\) can satisfy the condition.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1` with this value and \(x\).
   - It then checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and, if so, calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - It combines the results from the two calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes two parameters \(q\) and \(x\).
   - It initializes an empty list \(M\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(q\) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). If so, it adds this integer to \(M\).
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \(q\), checking if each integer is a divisor of \(q\). If a divisor is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\), it adds it to \(M\).
   - It also adds the corresponding quotient \(q // i\) to \(M\) if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - Finally, it returns the list \(M\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd by printing 0.
   - The program correctly calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) and uses these values to find potential \(k\) values.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\), which are potential \(k\) values.
   - The program combines the results from the two calls to `func_1`, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \(k\) values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 3x - 2\) correctly by not calling `func_1` with a negative or zero value.
   - The program ensures that \(k > 1\) by checking the divisors and only including those that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
