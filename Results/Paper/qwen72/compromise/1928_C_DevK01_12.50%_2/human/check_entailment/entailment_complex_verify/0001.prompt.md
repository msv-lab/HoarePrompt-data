You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q and x are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.

    #State: `q` and `x` remain unchanged, `M` contains integers that are divisors of `q` and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
    return M
    #The program returns the list `M` which contains integers that are divisors of `q` and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`. The function does not modify the input variables `q` and `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern of assigning numbers to positions in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), we need to determine how many different values of \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) can fit the constraints.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - Each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(x\).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The pattern of numbers repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - If \(n\) is the position and \(x\) is the number received, then \(n\) and \(x\) must satisfy the pattern.
   - The pattern can be broken down into two segments: the first \(k\) positions and the next \(k-2\) positions.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), the position \(n\) can be expressed as \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + r\), where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(r\) is the remainder.
   - The remainder \(r\) must be within the valid range for the pattern to fit.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - It checks if \(y\) is odd. If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \(q = (y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find possible values of \(k\).
   - It also checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional possible values of \(k\).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

6. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It first checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \(q\) and checks if they are divisors of \(q\).
   - If a divisor is found, it adds it to the list \(M\).
   - It also adds the quotient \(q // i\) to the list if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

7. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd by printing 0.
   - The logic for finding divisors in `func_1` is correct, but it should be noted that the square root check is not necessary for finding all divisors.
   - The program correctly combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
   - The program correctly prints the number of unique values of \(k\).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem constraints. However, the square root check in `func_1` is not necessary and can be simplified.

### Correctness:
**True**
