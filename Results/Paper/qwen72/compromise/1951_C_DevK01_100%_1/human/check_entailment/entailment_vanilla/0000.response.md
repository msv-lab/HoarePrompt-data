### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets that can be bought per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M`. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to consider the cheapest days first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**:
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days needed to buy at least `k` tickets, given the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`. This ensures that the program is considering the cheapest days to buy tickets.

5. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the number of days selected multiplied by the maximum number of tickets per day equals the total number of tickets needed. In this case, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days for each ticket bought.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the number of days selected multiplied by the maximum number of tickets per day does not equal the total number of tickets needed. In this case, the program:
     - Pops the last element from `N` and stores it in `w`.
     - Calculates `mu` as the remaining number of tickets needed after buying `m` tickets on each of the `n-1` days.
     - Adds the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day to the total cost.
     - Recalculates the cost for the remaining days using the same formula as before.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrect. This formula is intended to account for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days, but it does not correctly handle the price increases.
  - The correct way to handle the price increases is to calculate the additional cost for each day based on the number of tickets bought on that day and the subsequent days.

### Corrected Program:
To correctly handle the price increases, we need to adjust the cost calculation to account for the price increases on subsequent days. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        cost = 0
        for i in range(n):
            tickets = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets * (N[i] + i * tickets)
            k -= tickets
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - For each day `i` in the selected days `N`, the program calculates the cost of buying `tickets` (which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining `k` tickets) on that day.
  - The cost for each day is `tickets * (N[i] + i * tickets)`, where `N[i]` is the base price and `i * tickets` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.
  - The program then subtracts the number of tickets bought from `k` and continues to the next day.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed cost calculation.
- The corrected program should correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

Correctness: **False**
