### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The function ensures that `m` is at most `k` by setting `m = min(m, k)`. This is necessary because the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day should not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to consider the cheapest days first, which is optimal for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**:
   - The function calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This determines the minimum number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, given the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form the list `N`. These are the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the total number of tickets bought on the selected days equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If not, the function adjusts the cost by considering the remaining tickets to be bought on the last selected day. It pops the last element `w` from `N`, calculates the number of tickets `mu` to be bought on this day, and updates the cost accordingly.

7. **Output**:
   - The calculated cost is printed for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to calculate the cost for the first `n` days. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series, but it needs to be verified if it correctly accounts for the price increase due to ticket purchases.
  - The formula `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is used to adjust the cost for the remaining tickets. This formula also needs to be verified for correctness.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function should handle edge cases where `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in one day).
  - It should also handle cases where `k` is much larger than `m`, requiring multiple days to buy all tickets.

### Verification:
- **First Test Case**:
  - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `M = [8, 6, 4, 2]`.
  - Sorted `M` is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
  - `q = 2` (since `3 / 2` is `1.5` and the ceiling is `2`).
  - `N = [2, 4]`.
  - `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`.
  - Since `2 * 2 != 3`, the function pops `4` from `N` and sets `mu = 3 - (2 - 1) * 2 = 1`.
  - Cost is `1 * 4 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 * ((2 - 1) * 2 // 2) + 2 * 2 * 1 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16`.
  - This is incorrect. The correct cost should be `10` (buy 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4).

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`, `M = [8, 6, 4, 2]`.
  - Sorted `M` is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
  - `q = 4` (since `8 / 2` is `4`).
  - `N = [2, 4, 6, 8]`.
  - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`.
  - Since `4 * 2 == 8`, the cost is `2 * sum([2, 4, 6, 8]) + 2 * 2 * ((4 - 1) * 4 // 2) = 2 * 20 + 4 * 6 = 40 + 24 = 64`.
  - This is correct.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `m = 100`, `k = 1`, `M = [10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`.
  - Sorted `M` is `[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]`.
  - `q = 1` (since `1 / 100` is `0.01` and the ceiling is `1`).
  - `N = [1]`.
  - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`.
  - Since `1 * 1 == 1`, the cost is `1 * 1 + 1 * 1 * ((1 - 1) * 1 // 2) = 1 + 0 = 1`.
  - This is correct.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - `n = 6`, `m = 3`, `k = 9`, `M = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
  - Sorted `M` is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
  - `q = 3` (since `9 / 3` is `3`).
  - `N = [5, 5, 5]`.
  - `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `k = 9`.
  - Since `3 * 3 == 9`, the cost is `3 * sum([5, 5, 5]) + 3 * 3 * ((3 - 1) * 3 // 2) = 3 * 15 + 9 * 3 = 45 + 27 = 72`.
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function has a logical error in the cost calculation for the first test case. The formula used to adjust the cost when `n * m != k` is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
