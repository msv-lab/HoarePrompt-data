You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, num2 is an integer such that 1 <= num2 <= 500 representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer such that 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is `num2 - 1`, and `order` is the count of indices `j` (0 <= j < num2 - 1) where `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[j + 1]`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers (where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9) and an integer `num2` (where 1 <= num2 <= 500). It returns `True` if the elements in the list `a` are strictly increasing up to the index `num2 - 1`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.

2. **Array Validation**:
   - The program uses a list comprehension to convert the input string into a list of integers `a`.
   - It then checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is zero.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last.
  - Sorting the array in non-decreasing order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not the optimal approach for maximizing the beauty.
  - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the largest elements are placed first and the smallest elements are placed last.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it sorts the array in non-decreasing order, which minimizes the beauty, instead of sorting it in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
