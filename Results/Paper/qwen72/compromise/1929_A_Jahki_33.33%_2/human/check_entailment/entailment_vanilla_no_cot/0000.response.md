Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The problem requires the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements in any way, but the program only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and then computes the beauty based on the sorted array.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this is not necessary for the problem. The goal is to find the maximum beauty, not to determine if the array is sorted.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not maximize the beauty. The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, you should sort the array in non-increasing order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the array in non-increasing order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - Compute the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized for each test case.
