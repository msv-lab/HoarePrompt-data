Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `order` is 2 or 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `order` is incremented by 1.
- Initially, `order` could be 1 or 2 based on the conditions:
  - If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` is 1.
  - If `a[1]` is greater than or equal to `a[2]`, then `order` is 2; otherwise, `order` is 1.
- After the code `order += 1` is executed, `order` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2.
- The other variables (`a`, `num2`, `i`) remain unchanged.
