The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num2`. The loop will execute if `num2` is greater than 1, because `range(1, num2)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `num2 - 1`. If `num2` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The state of `a` and `order` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the state of `i` and `num2` must be considered.

For the loop to execute, `num2` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` must be greater than 1, `order` is 0, `i` is 1**
