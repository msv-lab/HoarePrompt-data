You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, if the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the string `s`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Single Character String:**
     - If the string `s` has only one character, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.
   - **All Characters the Same:**
     - If the string `s` has more than one character but all characters are the same, it is also impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly prints "No" in this case by checking if the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - For strings that can be rearranged, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`.
   - If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as `s`, the program falls back to a simple rearrangement by moving the first character to the end of the string (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` for valid cases.
   - It prints "No" for invalid cases.

### Analysis:
- **Random Shuffling:**
  - The use of `random.sample` to shuffle the string is a valid approach, but it is not guaranteed to produce a different string every time. However, the fallback logic ensures that if the shuffled string is the same as the original, a different string is generated.
- **Fallback Logic:**
  - The fallback logic `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` is correct because it guarantees that the new string `s2` will be different from `s` as long as `s` has more than one unique character.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string has only one character or all characters are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and handles all edge cases and valid inputs appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
