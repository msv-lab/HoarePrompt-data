You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, if the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string has more than one distinct character, but the random shuffling still results in the same string. The program attempts to fix this by swapping the first and last characters if the shuffled string is the same as the original, but this approach is not guaranteed to work for all cases. For example, consider the input string "abab". The random shuffling might produce "abab" again, and swapping the first and last characters will still result in "abab", which is not a valid rearrangement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
