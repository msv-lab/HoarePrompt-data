### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) are correctly implemented to build and root the tree. The `add_edge` method adds undirected edges, and the rooting methods correctly set the parent and children relationships, as well as compute the subtree sizes.

2. **Good Components and Remaining Size Calculation**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree. Both functions use a postorder traversal to ensure that the subtree sizes and good components are computed correctly before processing the current node.
   - `func_1` uses a stack to perform a non-recursive postorder traversal, which is a valid and efficient approach.
   - `func_2` uses a recursive postorder traversal, which is also correct but might be less efficient for large trees due to the recursion depth limit.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine this.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`. This is a correct approach to solving the problem, as it efficiently narrows down the possible values of `x`.

4. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`. The input handling is correct, and the output matches the problem description.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The logic for determining the maximum `x` is sound and follows the problem constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly constructs the tree, roots it, and uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in each remaining connected component having at least `x` vertices.

Correctness: **True**
