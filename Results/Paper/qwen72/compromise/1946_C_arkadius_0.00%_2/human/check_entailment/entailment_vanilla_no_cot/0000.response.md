Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the program's components and their roles:

1. **func_1**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a subtree that has a size of at least `x` after removing edges.

2. **func_2**: This is another DFS function that calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex `v`. It is similar to `func_1` but is used in a different context within the program.

3. **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`. It uses `func_1` to perform the necessary calculations.

4. **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has a size of at least `x`. It leverages `func_3` to check the feasibility of each potential `x`.

5. **func_5**: This is the main function that reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result of `func_4`.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats and uses appropriate algorithms (DFS and binary search) to solve the problem. The logic for determining the maximum `x` and ensuring that each component has at least `x` vertices after removing `k` edges is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
