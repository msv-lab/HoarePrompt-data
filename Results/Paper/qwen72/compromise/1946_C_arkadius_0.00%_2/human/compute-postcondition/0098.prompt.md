You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object with n vertices, s is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), and x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: The loop has completed, and `stack` is an empty list. For each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the total number of good components (subtrees) rooted at `v` where the size of the subtree is at least `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the size of the subtree rooted at `v` after removing all the good components.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the total number of good components (subtrees) rooted at vertex `s` where the size of the subtree is at least `x`, and the size of the subtree rooted at `s` after removing all the good components.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. It returns the total number of good components (subtrees) rooted at vertex `s` where the size of the subtree is at least `x`, and the size of the subtree rooted at `s` after removing all the good components.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of good components (subtrees) rooted at vertex `s` where the size of the subtree is at least `x`, and the size of the subtree rooted at `s` after removing all the good components.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
