The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `s`, and `x`. 

- `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices.
- `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, where 1 ≤ s ≤ n.
- `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component.

The function returns the total number of good components (subtrees) rooted at vertex `s` where the size of the subtree is at least `x`, and the size of the subtree rooted at `s` after removing all the good components.
