The function `func_5` does not take any parameters. However, it reads input values where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `u` and `v` are integers for each edge such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n` and `k` (integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) and for each edge, `u` and `v` (integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
