Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes, and `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` based on the user inputs.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5, inclusive.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last iteration of the loop.
- The value of `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The `tree` instance still has `n` nodes, but now it has `n-1` edges. Each edge was added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` based on the user inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
