Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2, `beg` is less than `end`, `end` is `mid` - 1.**

The value of `end` is updated to `mid` - 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `end` is now `mid` - 1, where `mid` is still calculated as (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2. The conditions for `n`, `k`, and the relationship between `beg` and `end` remain valid.
