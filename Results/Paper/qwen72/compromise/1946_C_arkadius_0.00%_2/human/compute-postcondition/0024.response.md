The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `v`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices. `v` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, with the constraint that `1 <= v <= n`. `x` is a positive integer. The function returns two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

- `good_components` is the sum of `good_components_subtree` for all children of `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- `remaining_size` is the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` for all children of `v` whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of `good_components_subtree` for all children of `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` for all children of `v` whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.**
