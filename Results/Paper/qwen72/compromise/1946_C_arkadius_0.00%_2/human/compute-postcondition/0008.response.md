The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes, and an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.**
