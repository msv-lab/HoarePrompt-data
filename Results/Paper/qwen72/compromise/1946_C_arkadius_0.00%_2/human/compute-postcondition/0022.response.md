Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a non-negative integer `k` such that `1 <= k < n`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` returns `True`. The function returns this value `x`, which is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The state of `tree`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
