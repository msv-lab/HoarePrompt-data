Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes, and an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.** 

The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between the nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `tree` now includes this additional edge, but the specific values of `u` and `v` are not provided, so the exact nodes connected are not specified.
