Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2, `beg` is less than `end`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, `beg` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `end` is updated to `mid` - 1.***
