The only object in the loop head is `stack`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stack` not being empty. At the end of the last iteration, the `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed but still contains at least one tuple.**
