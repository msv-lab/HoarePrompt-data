The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes, and an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.**
