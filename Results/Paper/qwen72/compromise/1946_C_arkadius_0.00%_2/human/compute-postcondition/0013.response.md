To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the function `func_4` in detail.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes.
- `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` based on user inputs.
- The `tree` has been rooted at node 0, and the parent of the root node (node 0) is -1.

### Function Analysis:
The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is not provided in the code snippet, but we can infer its purpose based on the context. Given that `tree` is a rooted tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and `k` is an integer, `func_4` likely performs some operation on the tree related to the value of `k`.

### Possible Function Behavior:
Without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only hypothesize based on common tree operations. One common operation in tree problems is to find the k-th ancestor of a node, or to perform some calculation involving the k-th level of the tree.

### Hypothetical Function:
Let's assume `func_4(tree, n, k)` returns the number of nodes at depth `k` in the tree. This is a reasonable assumption given the constraints and the context.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree has `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, making it a connected acyclic graph (a tree).
2. **Rooting**: The tree is rooted at node 0, and the parent of node 0 is -1.
3. **Depth Calculation**: The depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node.
4. **Function Call**: `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called with the tree, the number of nodes `n`, and the integer `k`.

### Output:
Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of what the function might return based on our hypothesis.

If `func_4(tree, n, k)` returns the number of nodes at depth `k` in the tree, the output will be the count of nodes at that depth.

Output: **number of nodes at depth k in the tree (where k is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n)**

If the function performs a different operation, the output will vary accordingly. However, based on the given information and a common tree operation, the above output is a reasonable description.
