Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 0, `i` is 3, and `j` is 2.***
