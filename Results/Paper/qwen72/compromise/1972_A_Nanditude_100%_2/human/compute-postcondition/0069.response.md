Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, both sorted in non-decreasing order (1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9). The function then calculates and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remaining as they were at the end of the last test case. **
