Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and `cnt` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` was initially 1 and is now 2.
- If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `cnt` was initially 0 and is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
