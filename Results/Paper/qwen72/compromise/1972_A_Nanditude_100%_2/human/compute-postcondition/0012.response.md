Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 0, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is incremented to 1, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i]`.***
