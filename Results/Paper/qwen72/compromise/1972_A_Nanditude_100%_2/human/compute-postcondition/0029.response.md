The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the input integer `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `j` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, and it will iterate up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required)
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `b` is a new list of integers input by the user
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `n-1`
- `cnt` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and `j` to be 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
