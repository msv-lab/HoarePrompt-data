#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first differing character between `a` and `b` has been swapped if `a` was initially less than `b`. The flag `f` is set to 1 if any swap occurred or if `a` was greater than `b` at any point. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `a` are printed in the same order as they are in the list after any potential swaps that occurred based on the initial state. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the flag `f` retains its value from the initial state.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `b` are printed in the same order as they are in the list. The variables `x`, `y`, `t`, and the flag `f` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each expected to be a string of digits from 1 to 9 of the same length. The function ensures that the first differing digit between the two strings, if `a` is initially less than `b`, is swapped. After processing, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` on separate lines, followed by a blank line. The function does not modify any external variables or handle multiple test cases as described in the comments.
