The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It also accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
