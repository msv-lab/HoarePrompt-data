Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0. If `len_a` > 1 and `a[0]` â‰¤ `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0. Additionally, `len_b` is greater than 1. The current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
