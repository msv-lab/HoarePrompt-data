To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, where `len_a` is the length of list `a` and `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
   - `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `d` is `k // 2`.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.

2. **Condition for Printing:**
   - The `print` statement checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means it is the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - `count_a` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The output depends on whether both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `count_a` and `count_b`.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d` (where `d` is `k // 2`), otherwise 'NO' (where `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`)**
