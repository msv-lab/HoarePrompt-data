The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
