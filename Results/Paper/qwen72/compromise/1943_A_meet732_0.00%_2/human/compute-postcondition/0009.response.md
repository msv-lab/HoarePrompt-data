Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 3.** 

The value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
