Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cntl` will have a length of `n + 1`, and each element at index `i` in `cntl` will represent the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any integer in `a` will remain 0. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
