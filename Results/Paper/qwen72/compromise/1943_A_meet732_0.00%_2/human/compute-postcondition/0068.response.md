Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `c` is decreased by 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly given a value of 3 in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `j`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `j` is 3, the `print` statement will print 3.

Output: **3**
