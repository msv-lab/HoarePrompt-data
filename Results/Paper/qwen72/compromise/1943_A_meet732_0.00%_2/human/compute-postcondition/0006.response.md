The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `cntl[i]` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 1**
