The code snippet `cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]` initializes the list `cntl` to have `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This overrides the previous value of `cntl`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**
