The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`, and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements. The next element in `a` will be assigned to `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
