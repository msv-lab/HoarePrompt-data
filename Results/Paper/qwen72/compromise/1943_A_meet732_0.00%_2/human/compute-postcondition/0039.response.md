Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `cntl`) remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains the integers that the user has input, and the length of `a` is now determined by the number of integers provided by the user. The list `cntl` still maintains its original purpose, where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.
