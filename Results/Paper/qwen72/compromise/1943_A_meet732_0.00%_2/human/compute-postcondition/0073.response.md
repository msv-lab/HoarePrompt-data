Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program retains all initial conditions. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is set to `n`, and if the loop has not broken early, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program has broken out of the loop, and the value of `j` where this occurred is printed.***
