Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (the third element of `a`) is 3 and all other elements are 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
- Since the initial state specifies that the element at index `i` in `cntl` is 2, after the increment, `cntl[i]` becomes 3.
- All other elements in `cntl` remain 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains the third element of `a`.
