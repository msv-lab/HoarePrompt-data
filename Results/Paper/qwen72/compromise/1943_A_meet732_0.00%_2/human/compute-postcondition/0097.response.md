The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is now 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
