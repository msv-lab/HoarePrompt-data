Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in the way it handles the binary search for the best position to insert the new problem complexity. Specifically, the use of `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` in the `func_6` function does not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, if the new complexity `D[mid] + f` is exactly equal to one of the existing complexities `left` or `right`, the program might not update `ans` correctly.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 100
50
50
```
In this case, the maximum difference is 90 (between 10 and 100). The program should be able to insert a new problem with complexity 100 (50 + 50), which would reduce the maximum difference to 50. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the binary search logic, leading to an incorrect result.
