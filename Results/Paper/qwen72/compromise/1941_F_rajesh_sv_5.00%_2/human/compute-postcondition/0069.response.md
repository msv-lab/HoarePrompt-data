Postcondition: ***`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The difference `mid_sum - left` is less than the difference `right - mid_next_sum` if the if condition is true, and greater than or equal to the difference `right - mid_next_sum` if the else condition is true.***
