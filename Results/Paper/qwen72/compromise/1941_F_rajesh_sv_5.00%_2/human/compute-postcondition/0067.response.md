Postcondition: **`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the first element in `F`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the difference `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to the difference `right - mid_next_sum`.**
