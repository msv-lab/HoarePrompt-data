Postcondition: **The loop has finished executing, and the variables `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.**
