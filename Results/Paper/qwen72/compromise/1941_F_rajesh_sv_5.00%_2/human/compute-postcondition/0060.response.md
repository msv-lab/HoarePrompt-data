Output State: **`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value is greater than `left - f`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to the index in `D` where the value is greater than `left - f` using `bisect_right`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
- `f` is still the first element in `F`.
- The condition that `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D` is still valid.
