Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
