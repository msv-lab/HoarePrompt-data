The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called.**
