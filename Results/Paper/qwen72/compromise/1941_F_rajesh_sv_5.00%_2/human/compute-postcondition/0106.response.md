Output State: **`l` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `h`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. The expressions for `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are still valid, but their values will be recalculated based on the new value of `l`.
