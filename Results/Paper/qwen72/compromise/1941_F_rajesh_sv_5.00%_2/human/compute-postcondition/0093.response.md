Output State: **`l` is now `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `h` remains the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is still `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is still `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the condition that the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum` still holds.
