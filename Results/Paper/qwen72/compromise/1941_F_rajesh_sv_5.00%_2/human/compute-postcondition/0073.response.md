Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `l` is now `mid + 1`, `h` is one index greater than `l`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- Since `mid` was equal to `l` in the initial state, `l` is now `mid + 1`.
- `h` is one index greater than the new `l`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
