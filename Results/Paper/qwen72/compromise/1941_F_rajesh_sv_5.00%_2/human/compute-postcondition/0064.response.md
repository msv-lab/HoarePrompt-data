Output State: **`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the first element in `F`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid] + f`, where `mid` is equal to `l`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`, where `mid + 1` is equal to `h` (since `h` is one index greater than `l`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
