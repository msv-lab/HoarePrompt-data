You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the user, which determines the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, ensuring that both are between 0 and 9. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the last values of `x` and `y` input by the user are retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` correctly. Specifically, in the `if x > y` block, it prints `x, y` instead of `y, x`, and in the `else` block, it prints `y, x` instead of `x, y`. This means that the program will always print the larger number first, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 9
```
The program will output:
```
9 1
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
1 9
```
