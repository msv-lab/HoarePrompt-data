Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.**
