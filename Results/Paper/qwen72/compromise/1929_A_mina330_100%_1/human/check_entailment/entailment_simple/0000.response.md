Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements is maximized when the elements are in increasing order.

However, the program prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array for each test case, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty. The correct approach should involve calculating the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements after sorting the array.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the maximum beauty as described in the problem. Instead of calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, it calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is a different value.

Correctness: **False**
