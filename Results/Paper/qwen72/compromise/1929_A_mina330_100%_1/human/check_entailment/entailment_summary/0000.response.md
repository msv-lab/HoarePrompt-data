Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The given program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This approach is incorrect because it does not compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and the beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

However, the program only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is correct for the maximum beauty but for the wrong reason. The correct approach should be to sum the differences between consecutive elements after sorting, but the program's output matches the correct answer for the maximum beauty due to the nature of the problem.

Given that the program's output matches the expected output for the provided test cases, it is technically correct for the specific problem, but the reasoning behind it is flawed.

Correctness: **True** (but the reasoning is incorrect)
