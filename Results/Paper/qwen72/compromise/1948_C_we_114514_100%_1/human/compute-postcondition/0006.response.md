To determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop, where `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are the inputs provided during each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list that stores the output of the function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of a loop.
   - The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, `func_1(n, row1, row2)` is called with the same values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know it returns a value that is added to the `results` list.

3. **Joining the Results**:
   - The `print` statement uses `'\n'.join(results)` to join all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not provided, and the function `func_1` is not defined, we can only describe the output in terms of the results of `func_1`.

Output: **Each result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop, printed on a new line.**

This means the output will be a series of values, one per line, where each value is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop.
