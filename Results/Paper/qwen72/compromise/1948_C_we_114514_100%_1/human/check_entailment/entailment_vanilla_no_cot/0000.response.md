Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - It first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2` because it needs to check pairs of columns.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the columns (excluding the last column) to check if there is a blocking condition.
   - The condition `if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` ensures that if the robot is in the first row and moves left, it should not be blocked by a left arrow in the second row either in the current column or the next column.
   - The condition `if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<'` checks the last column to ensure that if the robot is in the first row and moves left, it should not be blocked by a left arrow in the second row in the second-to-last column.
   - If neither of these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly checks the conditions for the robot to reach the target cell. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
