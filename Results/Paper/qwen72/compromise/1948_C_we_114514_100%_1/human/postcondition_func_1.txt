The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It reads these inputs from the standard input, calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` for each test case, and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.
