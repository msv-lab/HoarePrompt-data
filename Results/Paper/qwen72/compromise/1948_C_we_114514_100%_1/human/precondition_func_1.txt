No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it interacts with the input to obtain t, n, row1, and row2. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
