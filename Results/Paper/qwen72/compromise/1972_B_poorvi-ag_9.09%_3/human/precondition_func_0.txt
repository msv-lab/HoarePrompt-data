The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". The function should read the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) from the input, and for each test case, it should read n and s.
