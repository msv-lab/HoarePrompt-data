### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - The function checks if `n` (the number of coins) is even. If it is, the result is 'no' because if the number of coins is even, Bob will always have a move after Alice, and thus Alice cannot force a win.
   - If `n` is odd, the function counts the number of 'U' (facing up) and 'D' (facing down) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is greater than the number of 'D' coins, the result is 'yes' because Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with fewer 'U' coins, eventually forcing Bob to lose.
   - Otherwise, the result is 'no' because if the number of 'U' coins is not greater than the number of 'D' coins, Bob can always counter Alice's moves, and Alice will eventually lose.

3. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Even Number of Coins (`n % 2 == 0`):**
  - If `n` is even, the game will always end with Bob having a move after Alice, so Alice cannot win. This is a correct condition.
- **Odd Number of Coins (`n % 2 != 0`):**
  - If `n` is odd, the game can end with Alice having the last move if she can always force Bob into a position where he has fewer 'U' coins. The condition `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')` ensures that Alice has more 'U' coins to play with, which is a valid strategy for her to win.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
  - Output: `YES`
  - Reason: `n` is odd (5), and there are 3 'U' coins and 2 'D' coins. Alice can always force Bob into a position where he has fewer 'U' coins, so Alice wins.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Reason: `n` is odd (5), but there are 2 'U' coins and 3 'D' coins. Bob can always counter Alice's moves, so Alice loses.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2`, `UU`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Reason: `n` is even (2), so Bob will always have a move after Alice, and Alice cannot win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given conditions. It handles all the edge cases and test cases as described in the problem statement.
