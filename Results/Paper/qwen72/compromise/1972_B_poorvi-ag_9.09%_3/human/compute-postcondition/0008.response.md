Functionality: ** The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines and prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the following conditions: if `n` is even, the result is 'no'; if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, the result is 'yes'; otherwise, the result is 'no'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the results for all test cases. **
