Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer.** 

The value of `numInteger` is set to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `numCases`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
