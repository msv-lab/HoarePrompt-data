Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `numCases` is an integer where \(2 \leq numCases \leq 5000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(suma)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`numbers` is an empty list**: This means there are no integers in the list initially.
2. **`suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`**: Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs of integers to remove, and thus no minimum values to sum. Therefore, `suma` must be 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(suma)` statement will print the value of `suma`, which is 0 because `numbers` is empty and there are no pairs to consider.

Output: **0**
