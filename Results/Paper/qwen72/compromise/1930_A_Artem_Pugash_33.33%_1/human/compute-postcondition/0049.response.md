The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has two less elements but still contains at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 2 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order and contains at least one element (but now has two less elements), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`**
