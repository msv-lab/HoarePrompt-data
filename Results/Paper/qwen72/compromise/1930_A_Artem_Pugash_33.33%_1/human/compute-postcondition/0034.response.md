The only object in the loop head is `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` now contains one less element starting from the second element onwards. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `b` is `a`, `suma` is `2 * a`, and `numbers` must contain at least one element**
