You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The loop has printed 'Bob' for test cases where the absolute difference between a and b is even, and 'Alice' for test cases where the absolute difference between a and b is odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game is played in turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The player who ends up with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will be the one who can force the other player to lose.
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the game will always end in a draw or a loss for the player who starts (Alice), because both players will always have the same number of coins and the same moves available.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will have the advantage.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are both even or both odd, the difference \(|a - b|\) will be even.
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are of different parities (one even, one odd), the difference \(|a - b|\) will be odd.

4. **Winning Strategy:**
   - If \(|a - b|\) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice keeps, Bob keeps. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If \(|a - b|\) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will be the one who cannot make a move. Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is even.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - The logic matches the winning strategy described above.

Therefore, the program is correct.
