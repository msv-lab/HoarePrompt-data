Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game is played in turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be reduced to a parity problem. The player who ends up with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will have the advantage.
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the game will always end in a loss for the player who starts (Alice), because both players will always have the same number of coins and the same moves available.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will have the advantage.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are both even or both odd, the difference \(|a - b|\) will be even.
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are of different parities (one even, one odd), the difference \(|a - b|\) will be odd.

4. **Winning Strategy:**
   - If \(|a - b|\) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice keeps, Bob keeps. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If \(|a - b|\) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will be the one who cannot make a move. Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is even.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

6. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the game can be reduced to a parity problem.
   - The assessment correctly states that if the difference \(|a - b|\) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and win.
   - The assessment correctly states that if the difference \(|a - b|\) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position and win.
   - The program logic matches the winning strategy described in the assessment.

7. **Testing the Program:**
   - Let's consider the provided test cases:
     - For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(|1 - 1| = 0\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).
     - For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\), \(|1 - 4| = 3\) (odd), so the program prints "Alice" (correct).
     - For \(a = 5\) and \(b = 3\), \(|5 - 3| = 2\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).
     - For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 5\), \(|4 - 5| = 1\) (odd), so the program prints "Alice" (correct).
     - For \(a = 11\) and \(b = 9\), \(|11 - 9| = 2\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).
     - For \(a = 83\) and \(b = 91\), \(|83 - 91| = 8\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).
     - For \(a = 1032\) and \(b = 9307\), \(|1032 - 9307| = 8275\) (odd), so the program prints "Alice" (correct).
     - For \(a = 839204\) and \(b = 7281\), \(|839204 - 7281| = 831923\) (odd), so the program prints "Alice" (correct).
     - For \(a = 1000000000\) and \(b = 1000000000\), \(|1000000000 - 1000000000| = 0\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).
     - For \(a = 53110\) and \(b = 2024\), \(|53110 - 2024| = 51086\) (even), so the program prints "Bob" (correct).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - The logic matches the winning strategy described in the original assessment.
   - The program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
