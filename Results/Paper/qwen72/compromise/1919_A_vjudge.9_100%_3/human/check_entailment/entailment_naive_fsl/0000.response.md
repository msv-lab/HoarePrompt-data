Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used in the program to decide the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 1
```
According to the program:
- `abs(2 - 1) % 2 == 1`, so the program will output "Alice".

However, the correct output should be "Bob" because:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making the wallets (1, 2).
3. Bob then removes 1 coin from his wallet, making the wallets (1, 1).
4. Alice cannot remove a coin from her wallet without making it empty, so she must swap wallets with Bob, making the wallets (0, 1).
5. Bob then removes the last coin from his wallet, making the wallets (0, 0).
6. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

This test case demonstrates that the program does not handle the game logic correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
