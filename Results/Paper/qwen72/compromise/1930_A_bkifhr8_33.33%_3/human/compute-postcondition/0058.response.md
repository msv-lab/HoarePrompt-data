Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
