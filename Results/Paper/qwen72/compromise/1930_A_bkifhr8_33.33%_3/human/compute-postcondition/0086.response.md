Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is a new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first and third elements have been removed, `ans` is 0 if the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the third element (index 2) from the list `lst`.
- The initial state indicates that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first element has already been removed.
- After removing the third element, the list `lst` now has the first and third elements removed.
- The value of `ans` remains 0 if the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise it is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `ans_f`, `l`) remain unchanged.
