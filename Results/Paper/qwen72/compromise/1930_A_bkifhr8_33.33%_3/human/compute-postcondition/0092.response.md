Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (which is -1), `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from each test case, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, and `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variable `i` is `t - 1`, which is -1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The list `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements for each test case.
- The variable `n` is the last input integer, which must be greater than 0.
- The variable `l` is the last input string.
- The list `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, all but the last two elements will have been removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.
