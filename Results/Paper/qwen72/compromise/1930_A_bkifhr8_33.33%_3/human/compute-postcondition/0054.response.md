Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` converted to integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` after converting them to integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `n`, `l`, `lst`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `n` and `l` are not provided, but `n` must be greater than 0, and `lst` is derived from `l` by splitting it using spaces.
- The condition `t > n * 2` remains valid.
