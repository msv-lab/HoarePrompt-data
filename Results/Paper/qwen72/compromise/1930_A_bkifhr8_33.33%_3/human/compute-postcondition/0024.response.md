Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` added to the previous value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
