The code snippet provided appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `lst`. However, it does update the `ans_f` list by adding the current value of `ans` to it.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**
