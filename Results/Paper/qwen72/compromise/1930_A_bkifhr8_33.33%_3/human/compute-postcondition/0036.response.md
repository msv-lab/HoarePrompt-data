Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (which is 0), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**

The code `lst = l.split(' ')` updates the variable `lst` to be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `l` using spaces as the delimiter. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged.
