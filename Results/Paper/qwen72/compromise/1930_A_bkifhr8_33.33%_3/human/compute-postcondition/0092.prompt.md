Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers for each test case. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000. `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than 2, `lst` will be reduced to a list of length 2 or less, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements removed from `lst` during each iteration. If the length of `lst` was initially 2 or less, `ans` will be the minimum value between the elements of `lst`, and the loop will break after the first iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 4, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
