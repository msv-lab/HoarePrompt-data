The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The list `cases` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The exact nature of the result for each test case is not specified, but it is based on the 2n integers provided in the inner list for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases based on the provided integers.**
