To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n * 2):`, so the relevant objects are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop will iterate over the range `range(n * 2)`, which means `i` will start at 0 and go up to `n * 2 - 1`. The initial state of `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n * 2` is greater than 0. Since `n` is specified to be a new input integer that must be greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied.

3. **Other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `l`, `lst`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is 0**
