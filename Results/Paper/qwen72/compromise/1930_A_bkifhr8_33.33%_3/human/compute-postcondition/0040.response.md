Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (which is 0), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, `lst` has had its first element removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst` (since `0 * 2` is 0).
- The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. After removing the first element, the length of `lst` is reduced by 1, but it is still not equal to 2.
- The value of `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers. Since the first element has been removed, `ans` is now the minimum of the new first and second elements of `lst`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged.
