Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - min(a1 - a2, n)`, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**
