Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2`. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, with `hd` being greater than -1. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2` and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.***
