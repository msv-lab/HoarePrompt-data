Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `hd` is greater than -1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.**
