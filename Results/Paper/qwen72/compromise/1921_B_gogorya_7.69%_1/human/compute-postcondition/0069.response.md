The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is set to `n-1` before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`**
