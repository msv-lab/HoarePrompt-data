Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is decreased by 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
