Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 2, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2`, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1. If `hd` <= 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0', otherwise `res` remains unchanged. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', `hd` and `res` remain as they were before the if statement.***
