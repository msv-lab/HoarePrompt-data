Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
