Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triplets of elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`.
- The initial state specifies that `results` already contains two string representations of `ans`.
- After appending, `results` now contains three string representations of `ans`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
