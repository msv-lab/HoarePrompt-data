Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + 6`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 2, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the integer value of the string at index `idx` in the list `data`.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `x` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, which is different from the previous value of `x` (which was the integer value of `data[idx-1]`).
