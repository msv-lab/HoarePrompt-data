Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans` using the formula `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- The value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, so the formula calculates the number of combinations of 3 elements from `v[i]` and adds this to `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
