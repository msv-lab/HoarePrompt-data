The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0 to ensure `i` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1]`**
