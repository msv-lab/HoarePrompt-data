Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 3, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`**

Explanation:
- The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1.
- Initially, `v[x]` was 2, so after the increment, `v[x]` is now 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
