The code snippet `results.append(str(ans))` converts the value of `ans` to a string and appends it to the `results` list. The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains a single element, which is the string representation of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the corresponding integer `x` appears in `data` from index 2 to `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, calculated based on the counts in `v`.**
