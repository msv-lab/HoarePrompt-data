Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, `idx` is 0, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, and the function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
