Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is `2 + v[2]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`.
- The initial value of `cnt` is 2.
- The initial value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `v[i]` (which is `v[2]`) is added to `cnt`.
- Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `2 + v[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
