### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to parse the number of test cases `t` and the values for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient for large inputs, as it avoids multiple calls to `input()`.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and initializes a list `v` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then reads the stick lengths `a_i` and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Counting Valid Triangles:**
   - The program uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - It iterates through the list `v` to count the number of valid triangles:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and pairs them with any of the previously counted sticks.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `v[i]` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `v[i]` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.

4. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than the next higher power of 2.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a triangle is if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length.
  - It counts the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length, which is the correct approach given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by outputting 0.
  - It also handles the case where there are multiple sticks of the same length and calculates the combinations correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly counts the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle with the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
