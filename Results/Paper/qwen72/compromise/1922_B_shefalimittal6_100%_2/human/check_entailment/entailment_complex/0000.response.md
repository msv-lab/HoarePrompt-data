### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for competitive programming to optimize input reading.
   - The program then iterates over the input data to process each test case. The variable `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of sticks `n` and initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each exponent.
   - It then reads the exponents of the sticks and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - It does this by iterating over the list `v` and:
     - If `v[i]` (the count of sticks with exponent `i`) is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with exponent `i` and one stick with a smaller exponent. This is done using the formula `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
     - If `v[i]` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with exponent `i`. This is done using the formula `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
     - It updates `cnt` to include the count of sticks with exponent `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, as it will not enter the loop for calculating combinations and will append `0` to `results`.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where no three sticks can form a triangle, as it will not add any valid combinations to `ans`.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, where \(n\) is the number of sticks. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
