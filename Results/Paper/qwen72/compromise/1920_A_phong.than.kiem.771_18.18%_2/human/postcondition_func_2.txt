The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It returns a string where each integer from `arr` is converted to a string, followed by `sym`, and all these are concatenated together. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned string contains the elements of `arr` as strings, each followed by `sym`, in the order they appear in `arr`.
