Output State: **The values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `a` times, and during each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. For each pair, it prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.**
