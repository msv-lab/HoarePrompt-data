Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, the program prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `m` moves.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `n` is greater than `m` and both `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), the program prints "Yes". This is because the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for Nikita to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. For example, if `n` is 5 and `m` is 3, Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes (or add 4 cubes and remove 1 cube).
   - If `n` is greater than `m` and `n` and `m` have different parities, the program prints "No". This is because the difference between `n` and `m` would be odd, making it impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
