### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates `a` times to read pairs of integers `(b, c)` from the input. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `b == c`:**
     - If the number of moves `n` (denoted as `b`) is equal to the desired number of cubes `m` (denoted as `c`), then it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes by simply adding one cube per move. The function correctly prints 'YES' in this case.
   - **If `b < c`:**
     - If the number of moves `n` is less than the desired number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes because you can only add or remove one cube per move. The function correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:**
     - If the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes. This is because:
       - If both are even, you can add cubes in pairs (e.g., add 2 cubes, remove 2 cubes) to achieve the desired number.
       - If both are odd, you can add cubes in pairs and then add one more cube to achieve the desired number.
     - The function correctly prints 'Yes' in this case.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - If `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes because the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will always match the parity of the number of moves. The function correctly prints 'No' in this case.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints 'YES', 'Yes', or 'No' as required by the problem description. The case of the output is not strictly enforced, so 'Yes' and 'NO' are acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
