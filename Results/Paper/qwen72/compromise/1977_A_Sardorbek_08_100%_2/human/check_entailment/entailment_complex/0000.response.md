Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates `a` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` for that test case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b == c`, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower.
   - If `b < c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, the function prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by alternating between adding and removing cubes in a way that the final number of cubes matches `m`.
   - Otherwise, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints 'Yes', 'No', 'YES', or 'NO' as required by the problem statement. The case of the letters does not matter, so the output is valid.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles all edge cases correctly, including the minimum and maximum values for `n` and `m` (1 to 100).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
