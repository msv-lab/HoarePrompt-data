Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the result in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`, and the list `p` remain unchanged.
