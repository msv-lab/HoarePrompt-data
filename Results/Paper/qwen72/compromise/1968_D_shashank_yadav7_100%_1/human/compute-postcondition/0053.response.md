Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the next value after `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `s` is the input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. After the if-else block, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively.
- The variables `t`, `i`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are not directly affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.
- The new values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the integers provided by the user input.
- The conditions and calculations involving `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state, but now `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` have specific values from the user input.
