Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 2)`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value.
- The initial value of `sp` was `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- After the addition, `sp` becomes `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.
