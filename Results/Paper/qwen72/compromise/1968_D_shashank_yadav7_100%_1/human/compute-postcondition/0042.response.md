Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the last value before `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` if the loop runs for all `n` iterations. If `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes, `i` will be the last value it had before the loop broke.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`k`**: Decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop. If the loop runs for all `n` iterations, `k` will be the initial value of `k` minus `n`. If the loop breaks early because `k` becomes 0, `k` will be 0.
- **`b`**: The value of `b` is updated by repeatedly applying the transformation `p[b] - 1` for each iteration. The final value of `b` is the result of applying this transformation `i + 1` times.
- **`p`**: Remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`s`**: The value of `s` is updated by repeatedly applying the transformation `p[s] - 1` for each iteration. The final value of `s` is the result of applying this transformation `i + 1` times.
- **`sp`**: Initially, `sp` is the value at index `s` in the list `a`. For each iteration, the value at the new index `s` in `a` is added to `sp`. The final value of `sp` is the sum of the initial value and the values added during each iteration.
- **`bp`**: Initially, `bp` is the value at index `b` in the list `a`. For each iteration, the value at the new index `b` in `a` is added to `bp`. The final value of `bp` is the sum of the initial value and the values added during each iteration.
- **`bm`**: Initially, `bm` is `a[b] * k`. For each iteration, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp` for the current iteration. The final value of `bm` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations.
- **`sm`**: Initially, `sm` is `a[s] * k`. For each iteration, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp` for the current iteration. The final value of `sm` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations.
- **If `k` becomes 0 at any point**: The loop breaks, and both `bm` and `sm` are set to 0.
