Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0 + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now `a[s] * k`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` (or `2 * a[b]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + 3 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
