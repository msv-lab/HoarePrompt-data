The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, which is correct for the loop to begin. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `b` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`**
