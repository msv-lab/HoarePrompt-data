Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the input integer.
- `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations).
- `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations).
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **Draw**
