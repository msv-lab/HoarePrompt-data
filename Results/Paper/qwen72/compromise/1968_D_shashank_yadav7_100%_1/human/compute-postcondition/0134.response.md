The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`**
