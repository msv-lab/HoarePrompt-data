Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `sm` is calculated as the maximum of the previous `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
