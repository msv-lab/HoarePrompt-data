Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now the input integer - 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but the expressions for `bm` and `sm` need to be updated to reflect the new value of `k`. Since `k` was originally the input integer, the new value of `k` is `input integer - 1`, so `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`.
