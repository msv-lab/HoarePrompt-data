The value of `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. The initial value of `bp` is `a[b]`, so after the increment, `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
