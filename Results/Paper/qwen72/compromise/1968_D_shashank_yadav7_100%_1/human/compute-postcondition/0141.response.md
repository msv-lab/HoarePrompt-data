Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + 3 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` to be the maximum of its previous value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
- The previous value of `sm` is not changed if `a[s] * k + sp` is less than or equal to the current value of `sm`.
- The value of `sm` is updated to `a[s] * k + sp` if this expression is greater than the current value of `sm`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, `bp`) remain unchanged.
- If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
