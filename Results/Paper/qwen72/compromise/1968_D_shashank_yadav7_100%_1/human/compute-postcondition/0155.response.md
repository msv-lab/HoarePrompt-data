The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input data through standard input or a predefined method. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the function reads the following:

- The first line contains four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, where `1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`.
- The second line contains `n` integers `p_1, ..., p_n`, representing a permutation where `1 ≤ p_i ≤ n`.
- The third line contains `n` integers `a_1, ..., a_n`, representing an array where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given test cases. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by a permutation of `n` integers and an array of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
