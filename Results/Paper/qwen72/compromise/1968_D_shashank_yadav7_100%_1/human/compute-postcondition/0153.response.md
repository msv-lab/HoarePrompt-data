Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or the input integer - `n` if `k` never becomes 0, `b` is the value of `p[p[...[p[b] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `s` is the value of `p[p[...[p[s] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over `n` iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm <= sm` is true.***
