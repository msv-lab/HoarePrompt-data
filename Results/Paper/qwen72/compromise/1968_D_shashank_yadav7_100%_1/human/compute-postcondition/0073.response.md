The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
