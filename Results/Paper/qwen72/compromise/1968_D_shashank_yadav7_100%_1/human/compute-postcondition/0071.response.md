The code snippet `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `sp` was initially defined as `a[p[s] - 1]`.
- After the execution of the code, `sp` is updated to `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
