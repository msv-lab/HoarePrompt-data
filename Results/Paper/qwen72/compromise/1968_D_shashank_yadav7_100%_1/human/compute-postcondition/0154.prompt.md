Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n representing the permutation, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. The third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n representing the array, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `t` is the number of test cases, which is an integer value provided by the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the last value before `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. After the if-else block, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the input integer, `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or the input integer - `n` if `k` never becomes 0, `b` is the value of `p[p[...[p[b] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `s` is the value of `p[p[...[p[s] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over `n` iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm <= sm` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
