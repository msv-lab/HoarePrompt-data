### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a list of slimes with sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds each slime can be eaten, or -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted, which is not equal to `x`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from the left.
   - It maintains two lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left` keeps a cumulative sum of the sizes of slimes from the start to the current index.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime was different from the previous one.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than its left neighbor, it can be eaten in 1 second.
   - If it is not smaller, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it can be eaten by finding the smallest index `inx` where the cumulative sum of sizes up to `i` minus the size of the current slime minus 1 is greater than or equal to the size of a slime before it.
   - It then updates `ans[i]` with the minimum of `i + 1 - inx` and the last index where the size was different.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from both directions (left and right).
   - It then combines the results from both directions to get the final answer.
   - If a slime can be eaten from either direction, it takes the minimum of the two times. If it cannot be eaten from either direction, it remains -1.

5. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` is called twice: once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - The results from both calls are combined to ensure that the minimum time is considered from both directions.
   - The final output is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or reporting that it is impossible. The use of `func_1` to find the appropriate index and the cumulative sum in `func_2` to calculate the minimum time are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
