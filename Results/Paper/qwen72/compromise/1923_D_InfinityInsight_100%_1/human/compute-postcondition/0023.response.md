Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing integers 0, \(a[0]\), \(a[0] + a[1]\), and \(a[0] + a[1] + a[2]\), `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1, `i` is \(a[2]\).**
