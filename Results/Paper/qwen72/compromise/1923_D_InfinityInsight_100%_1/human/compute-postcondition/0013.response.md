The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (i.e., `1 <= i < n`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 3.**
