Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a). `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. `last` is a list containing a single integer -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
        last.append(i)
    else:
        last.append(last[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a) and n must be greater than 1. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1 and 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing two integers -1, -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, 2, and 3. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, -1, and -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
