Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a). `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. `last` is a list containing a single integer -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1.**
