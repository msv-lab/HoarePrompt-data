The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where `0 <= times <= len(arr)`). It returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` in `arr`. This effectively means it returns the difference between the last element and the element that is `times` positions before the last element, or the first element if `times` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`.
