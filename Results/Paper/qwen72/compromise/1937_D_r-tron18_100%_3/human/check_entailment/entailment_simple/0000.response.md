### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with cells containing either `<` or `>`.
   - When a pinball is placed on a cell, it moves left if the cell contains `<` and right if the cell contains `>`.
   - After moving, the direction of the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s1`.
   - It then calls `func_2(s1, n)` to compute the answers for each starting position.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `pre` is a list of indices where `s1` contains `>`.
   - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices, initialized with 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sum of indices where `s1` contains `<` as we iterate from right to left.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` to store the results for each starting position.
   - The program iterates over the string `s1` from right to left:
     - If the current character is `>`, it calculates the time based on the cumulative sums and updates `preOne` and `totalOne`.
     - If the current character is `<`, it calculates the time based on the cumulative sums and updates `suffZero`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for the current test case.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element in the list `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - It is used to compute the cumulative sums and differences needed for the time calculations in `func_2`.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary data structures.
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is based on the cumulative sums of indices where the characters are `>` or `<`.
   - The program correctly handles the inversion of the characters after each move.
   - The results are computed for each starting position and printed correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string `s1` contains only `>` or only `<`.
   - The program handles the case where the string `s1` is of length 1.
   - The program correctly updates the cumulative sums and indices as it iterates through the string.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the movement of the pinball, the inversion of the characters, and the calculation of the time it takes to leave the grid for each starting position.

Correctness: **True**
