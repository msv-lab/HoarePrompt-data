Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the difference between the sum of indices of all '<' characters to the right of the current index and the sum of indices of all '>' characters to the left of the current index, adjusted by the total length of the string `n` and the initial state of the lists `preOne` and `suffZero`. The lists `preOne` and `suffZero` are empty, and `totalOne` is 0.**
