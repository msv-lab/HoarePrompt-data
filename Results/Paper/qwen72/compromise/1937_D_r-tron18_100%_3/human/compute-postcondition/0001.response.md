Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre`, which represents the indices of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. Therefore, `totalOne` is assigned the value of the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
