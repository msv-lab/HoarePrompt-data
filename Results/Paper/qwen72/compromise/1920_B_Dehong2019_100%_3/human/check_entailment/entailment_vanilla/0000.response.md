### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `ans1`.

3. **Bob's Optimal Moves**:
   - Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The program iterates over the first `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts `2 * a[i]` from `ans1` for each element. This is because multiplying an element by -1 changes its contribution to the sum from `a[i]` to `-a[i]`, which is equivalent to subtracting `2 * a[i]` from the initial sum.

4. **Alice's Optimal Moves**:
   - Alice can remove at most `k` elements to maximize the sum.
   - The program then iterates over the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds `a[i]` to `ans1` for each element. This is because removing an element from the array is equivalent to adding its value to the sum (since it was initially subtracted).
   - For each element removed by Alice, if there are still elements left for Bob to multiply by -1 (i.e., `i + x < n`), the program subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1` to account for Bob's optimal move.

5. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The program keeps track of the maximum possible sum `ans2` after Alice's and Bob's moves.
   - It prints the maximum sum `ans2` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in descending order is a good strategy because Alice should remove the largest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `ans1` is correctly calculated.
- **Bob's Moves**: The program correctly applies Bob's moves by subtracting `2 * a[i]` for the first `x` elements.
- **Alice's Moves**: The program correctly applies Alice's moves by adding `a[i]` for the first `k` elements and adjusting for Bob's moves if applicable.
- **Final Sum**: The program correctly keeps track of the maximum possible sum after both players' moves.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice's and Bob's optimal moves and calculates the final sum accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
