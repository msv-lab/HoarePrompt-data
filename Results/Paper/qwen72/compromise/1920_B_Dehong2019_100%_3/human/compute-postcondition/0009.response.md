Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, where the integers are provided as input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]` minus an additional `2 * a[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `x` must be greater than `i + 1` still holds. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
