Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than `i + 1`, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, where the integers are provided as input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[i]` from the current value of `ans1`. Since `ans1` was initially the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`, after the execution, `ans1` becomes the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
