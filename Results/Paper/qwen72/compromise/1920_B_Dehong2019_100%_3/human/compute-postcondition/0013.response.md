Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans2` is assigned to be the same as `ans1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `_`, `a`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged.
- `ans1` is still the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`.
- `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`.
