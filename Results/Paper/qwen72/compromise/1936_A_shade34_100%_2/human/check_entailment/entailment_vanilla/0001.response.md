### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `mak` such that `p_mak` is the maximum element in the permutation.
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? mak mak i i` to compare `p_mak` with `p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
   - The variable `mak2` is set to `mak`.
   - A list `pans` is initialized to store potential candidates for the second maximum element.
   - The loop iterates over all indices `i` to find indices that are greater than or equal to `p_mak`.
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? mak mak2 i mak2` to compare `p_i` with `p_mak2`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and sets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0.
   - The loop iterates over the list `pans` to find the index `pans[mak]` such that `p_pans[mak]` is the maximum element in `pans`.
   - For each index `i` in `pans`, it queries `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` to compare `p_pans[mak]` with `p_pans[i]`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the answer.
   - It ensures that the output is flushed to avoid the Idleness Limit Exceeded error.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. The logic for finding the maximum and second maximum elements, and then the maximum XOR pair, is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.

**Correctness: **True****
