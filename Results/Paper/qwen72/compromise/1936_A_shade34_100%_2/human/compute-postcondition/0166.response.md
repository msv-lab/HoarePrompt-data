Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

Explanation: The code `mak2 = mak` assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` now holds the same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
