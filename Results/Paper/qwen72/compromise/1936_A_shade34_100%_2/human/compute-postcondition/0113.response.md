The code `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0)
- `i` is 1
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `pans` is an empty list
- `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

After executing `pans.append(i)`, the value of `i` (which is 1) is added to the list `pans`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0)
- `i` is 1
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `pans` is `[1]`
- `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[1]`, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.**
