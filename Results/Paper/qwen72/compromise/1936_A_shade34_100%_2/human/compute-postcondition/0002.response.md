The code snippet assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. This does not affect the values of `_` or `n`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **The input must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `mak` is 0.**
