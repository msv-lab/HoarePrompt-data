Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our task).
- `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 1 (This variable is also not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our task).
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our task).
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our task).
- If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1 (However, the initial state specifies that `mak` is 0, and there is no indication that the user input has been processed yet).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`?`**: This is a literal string character that will be printed as is.
2. **`mak`**: According to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
3. **`mak`**: Again, according to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
4. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 2.
5. **`i`**: Again, according to the initial state, `i` is 2.

### Final Output:
The print statement will print the following values in the specified order:
- The literal string `?`
- The value of `mak` which is 0
- The value of `mak` which is 0
- The value of `i` which is 2
- The value of `i` which is 2

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
