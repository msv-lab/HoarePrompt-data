The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.**
