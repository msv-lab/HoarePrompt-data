Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
