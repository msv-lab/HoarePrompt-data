The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
