Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` remains 0.

4. **Determine the Values of Other Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - It will then print the value of `mak` twice.
   - It will then print the value of `i` twice.

Given the initial state and the conditions:
- If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 1.
- If the user input is not `<`, `mak` is 0.
- `i` is always 2.

Therefore, the output will depend on the user input:
- If the user input is `<`:
  - `mak` is 1.
  - The output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.

- If the user input is not `<`:
  - `mak` is 0.
  - The output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the task requires us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<` and 0 otherwise)**
