Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input positive integer provided by the user.
- All other variables (`_`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
