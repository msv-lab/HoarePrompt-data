Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is initially `n-1`, but it is later set to 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This is set to 0.
2. **`i`**: This is set to 1.
3. **`pans`**: This is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. Let's denote these values as `pans[0]` and `pans[1]`.

### Values in the Print Statement:
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` because `mak` is 0.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` again.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[1]` because `i` is 1.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[1]` again.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- `'?'` (a literal question mark)
- `pans[0]` (the first element of the `pans` list)
- `pans[0]` (the first element of the `pans` list again)
- `pans[1]` (the second element of the `pans` list)
- `pans[1]` (the second element of the `pans` list again)

### Example:
If `pans` is `[3, 5]`, then the output will be:
```
? 3 3 5 5
```

### General Output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] and pans[1] are the first and second elements of the pans list, respectively)**
