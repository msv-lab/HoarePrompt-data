Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is either 1 or 2 depending on the user input.
   - If the user input is not `>`, `mak` is 1.
   - If the user input is `>`, `mak` is 2.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` will be the value at index 1 or 2 of the `pans` list.

2. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` will be the value at index 3 of the `pans` list.

3. **`pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are repeated twice**:
   - The print statement will output the values at these indices twice.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a string starting with `?` followed by the values at the specified indices in the `pans` list.
- Since `mak` can be either 1 or 2, and `i` is 3, the output will depend on the value of `mak`.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 1:
  - Output: **? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]**
- If `mak` is 2:
  - Output: **? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]**

### General Format:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where mak is 1 if the user input is not >, otherwise mak is 2, and pans is a list containing at least 4 values of i for which the user input was =)**
