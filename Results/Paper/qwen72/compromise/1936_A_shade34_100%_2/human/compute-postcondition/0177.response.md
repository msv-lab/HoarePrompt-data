Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, `s` is `=`.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially an empty list, it now contains the single element `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
