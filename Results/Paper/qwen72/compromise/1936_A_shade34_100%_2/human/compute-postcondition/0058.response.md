Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements. The user input is `>`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is `n-1`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`) retain their initial values.
- The user input remains `>`.
