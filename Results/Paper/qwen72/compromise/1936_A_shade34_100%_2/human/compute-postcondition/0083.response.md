Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is updated to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first value in the print statement is a string `'?'`.
   - The second and third values are both `mak`, which is 0 (unless the user input was `<`, in which case `mak` would be 1).
   - The fourth and fifth values are both `i`, which is 2.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
   - The value of `mak` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the user input was `<` or not.
   - The value of `i` is 2.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input was not `<`, `mak` remains 0.
   - If the user input was `<`, `mak` is updated to 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If the user input was not `<`:
  Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
- If the user input was `<`:
  Output: **? 1 1 2 2**

Since the initial state does not specify the user input, we need to consider both cases. However, if we assume no specific user input is given, the default value of `mak` is 0.

Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
