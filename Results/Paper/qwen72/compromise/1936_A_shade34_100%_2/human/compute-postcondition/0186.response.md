The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list. After appending `i`, which is 1, the list `pans` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, `pans` is `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is `[1]`.**
