The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially set to `n`, `mak` will now be equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements.**
