Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[0]`, `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain the current value of `i`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
