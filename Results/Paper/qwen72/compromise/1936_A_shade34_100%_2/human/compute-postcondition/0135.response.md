The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**
