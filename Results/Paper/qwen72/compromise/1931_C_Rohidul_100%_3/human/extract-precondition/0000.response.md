Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array for each test case. The length of each inner list n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def min_burles(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing an array for a test case.
