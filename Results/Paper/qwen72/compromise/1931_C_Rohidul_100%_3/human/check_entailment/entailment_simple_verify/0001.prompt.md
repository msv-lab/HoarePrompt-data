You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array for each test case. The length of each inner list n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` have been updated according to the logic of the loop. Specifically, for each test case, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the result of the computation `le - max(st, end)` unless the first and last elements of `a` are equal, in which case `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. The final output for each test case is the value of `ans`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal using the minimum number of burles.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value `x`.
   - The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1)`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes two counters `st` and `end` to 1, which will be used to count the lengths of the initial and final segments of the array that are already equal.
   - The program then moves the left pointer `l` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element, incrementing `st` each time.
   - Similarly, it moves the right pointer `r` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element, incrementing `end` each time.
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as the total length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal, the program updates the cost to be the total length minus the sum of `st` and `end`, ensuring it is at least 0.
   - Finally, it prints the cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements at the beginning and the end of the array.
   - It calculates the minimum cost by considering the maximum of these segments.
   - If the first and last elements are equal, it further optimizes the cost by considering the combined length of these segments.
   - The program handles all edge cases, such as when the array is already equal or when the array has only one element.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly outputs 0 burles.
   - **Array with All Elements Equal**: The program correctly outputs 0 burles.
   - **Array with Different Elements**: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the minimum cost is 4 burles.
     - For `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the minimum cost is 0 burles.
     - For `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the minimum cost is 2 burles.
     - For `[1]`, the minimum cost is 0 burles.
     - For `[1, 2]`, the minimum cost is 1 burle.
     - For `[1, 2, 3]`, the minimum cost is 2 burles.
     - For `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the minimum cost is 6 burles.
     - For `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the minimum cost is 7 burles.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly solves the problem by identifying the longest segments of equal elements at the beginning and end of the array and calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It handles all edge cases and test cases correctly.
