Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.**

Explanation:
- `st` and `end` are both set to 1.
- The value of `ans` is recalculated as `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
- All other variables (`a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `n > st` is now `n > 1`.
