Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is 2, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
