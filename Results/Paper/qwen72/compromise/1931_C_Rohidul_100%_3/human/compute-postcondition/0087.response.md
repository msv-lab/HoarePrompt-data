Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element and `l` must be less than `n - 1`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- `le` is still the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is still the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, and it must be less than `n - 1`.
- `r` is now the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element.
- `st` is still the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal.
- `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal.
- `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- The input condition `int(input())` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `_` is still 2.
- `n` is still the input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.
