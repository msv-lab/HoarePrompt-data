Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `l` or `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` with a new list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
