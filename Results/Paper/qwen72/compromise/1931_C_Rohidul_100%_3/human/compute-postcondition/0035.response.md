Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**
