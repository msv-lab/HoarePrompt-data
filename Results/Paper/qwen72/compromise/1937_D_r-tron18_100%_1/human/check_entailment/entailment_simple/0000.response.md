### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s1`.
   - It then calls `func_2(s1, n)` to compute the results for each starting position.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of '>', which is the length of `pre`.
   - `preOne` is a cumulative sum list of `pre`, initialized with 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list that keeps track of the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '<' from the end of the string.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` to store the results for each starting position.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
   - If the current cell is '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the `func_1` function.
   - If the current cell is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the `func_1` function.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes a list `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element `times` positions before the last element.
   - This function is used to calculate the cumulative effect of the pinball's movements.

6. **Output:**
   - The results for each starting position are printed as a space-separated list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initialization:**
  - `pre` correctly stores the indices of '>'.
  - `totalOne` correctly counts the number of '>'.
  - `preOne` correctly computes the cumulative sums of `pre`.
  - `suffZero` is initialized to keep track of the cumulative sums of '<' from the end.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly handles both '<' and '>' cases.
  - For '>', it correctly calculates the time to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sums and the number of '>' and '<' characters.
  - For '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time to leave the grid similarly.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly computes the difference between the last element and the element `times` positions before the last element.
  - This is used to handle the cumulative effect of the pinball's movements.

- **Final Output:**
  - The results are correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate.

### Correctness:
