The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1` and `n`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the input string `s1`.

Since the output is not specified in the prompt, I will assume the function returns a count of the number of '<' characters in the string `s1`.
