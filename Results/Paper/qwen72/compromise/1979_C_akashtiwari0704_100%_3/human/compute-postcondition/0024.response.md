Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])` + `int(a[1])`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the value of `a[2]` because `i` is 2.
- `a[2]` is now set to `prod // a[2]`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain as specified in the initial state.
- The value of `sumo` is also unchanged, as it was only increased in the initial state and not affected by the current code snippet.
