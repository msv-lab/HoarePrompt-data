Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])` + `int(a[1])` + `int(a[2])`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[2]` to `sumo`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
- The value of `sumo` is now increased by the integer value of `a[2]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
