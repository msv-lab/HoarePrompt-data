Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty string, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of the updated list `a` followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first three elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
