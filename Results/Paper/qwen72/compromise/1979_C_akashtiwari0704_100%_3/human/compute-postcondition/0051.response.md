Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list. The function updates a variable `g` to the LCM of the elements in `l` by iterating through the list and computing the LCM incrementally. After the function concludes, `g` contains the LCM of all elements in `l`. **
