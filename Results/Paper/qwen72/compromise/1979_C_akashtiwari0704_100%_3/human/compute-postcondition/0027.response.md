Postcondition: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `bets` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
