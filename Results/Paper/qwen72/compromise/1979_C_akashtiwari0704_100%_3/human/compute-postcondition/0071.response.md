Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of the updated list `a` followed by a space, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
