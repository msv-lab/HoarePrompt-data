Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than 0, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**
