Output State: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `ans` is now an empty string.
