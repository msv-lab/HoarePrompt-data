Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is `int(a[0])`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[0])` to it.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a`, `prod`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
