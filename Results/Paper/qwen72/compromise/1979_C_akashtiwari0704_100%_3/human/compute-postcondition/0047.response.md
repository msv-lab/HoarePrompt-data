Output State: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets + 1`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space. `l` must have at least `bets + 1` elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[bets] // gcd(g, l[bets])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- Since `i` is `bets + 1`, the expression `l[i]` refers to `l[bets + 1]`.
- The value of `g` is now `g * l[bets + 1] // gcd(g, l[bets + 1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
