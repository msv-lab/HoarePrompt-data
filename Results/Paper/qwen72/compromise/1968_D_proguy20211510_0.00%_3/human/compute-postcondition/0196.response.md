Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
