To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to -1, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(k)` function at the start of the loop. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is -1, `k` must be greater than 0**
