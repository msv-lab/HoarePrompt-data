Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true, `founds` is true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 0) * maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - (-1 + 1)) * maxa` or `k * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `s`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is -1, `(i + 1)` equals 0, so the expression simplifies to `k * maxa`. Therefore, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
