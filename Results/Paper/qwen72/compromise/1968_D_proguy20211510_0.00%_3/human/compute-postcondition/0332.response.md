Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`.** 

The value of `i` remains 2, `k` remains greater than 2, and the values of `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged. The list `b` now has a new element appended, which is the value of `a[pb - 1]`. The list `s` and the variables `a`, `ps`, and `pb` are not affected by this code snippet.
