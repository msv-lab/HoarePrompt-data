Postcondition: ***`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, and `foundb` is either true or false. If `foundb` is true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is set to true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `founds` is false.***
