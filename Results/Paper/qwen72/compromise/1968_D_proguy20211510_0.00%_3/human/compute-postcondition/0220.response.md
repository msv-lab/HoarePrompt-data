To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `len(s)` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list**
