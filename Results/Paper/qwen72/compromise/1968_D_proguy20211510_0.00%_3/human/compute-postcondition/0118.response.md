Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` has a new element appended which is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and another new element appended which is `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` has a new element appended which is `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]` and another new element appended which is `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The list `pres` still contains `len(s)` elements, each being the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index.
- The value of `rem` remains `k - 2`.
- The list `ptsb` still has the elements `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`.
- The list `ptss` now has an additional element appended, which is `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`. This is because `i` is 1 and `rem` is `k - 2`. The first element in `ptss` is `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`, and the second element is `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`.
