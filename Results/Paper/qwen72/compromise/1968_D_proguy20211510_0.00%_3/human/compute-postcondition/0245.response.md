The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pres`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pres`. If `i` is less than the length of `pres`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `pres` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pres` must have at least three elements.

State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least three elements, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, and `preb[2] + (k - 3) * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the values `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`, and `pres[2] + (k - 3) * s[2]`**
