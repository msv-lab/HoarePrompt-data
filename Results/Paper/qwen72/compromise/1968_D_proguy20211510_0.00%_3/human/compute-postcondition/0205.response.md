Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is true, `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 2) * maxa` and the value `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list that includes the value `maxa` and the new value `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `founds` is false, `s` is a list that includes the new value `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]`.**
