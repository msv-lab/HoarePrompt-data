Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with two elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `rem` is `k - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The list `pres` remains unchanged, with each element being the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index.
- The list `ptsb` initially had one element equal to `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`. After the code execution, a second element is appended to `ptsb`, which is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`.
- The list `ptss` remains unchanged, with one element equal to `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`.
- The value of `rem` remains `k - 2`.
