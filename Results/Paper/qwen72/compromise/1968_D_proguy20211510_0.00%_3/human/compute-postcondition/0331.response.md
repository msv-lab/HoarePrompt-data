Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `foundb` is True, `founds` can be either True or False, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`.** 

The value of `i` remains 2, `k` remains greater than 2, and `foundb` remains True. The value of `founds` can still be either True or False, but `b` now has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`. The states of `a`, `pb`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet.
