Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the values `sb + b[i]` and `sb + b[k]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i]`, `s` must have a length greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`.
- Since `i` is `k`, `b[i]` is equivalent to `b[k]`.
- The value `sb + b[i]` is the same as `b[i] + b[k]`, which is `b[k] + b[k]`.
- Therefore, `preb` now contains the values `sb + b[i]` (from the initial state) and `b[k] + b[k]` (from the current execution).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
