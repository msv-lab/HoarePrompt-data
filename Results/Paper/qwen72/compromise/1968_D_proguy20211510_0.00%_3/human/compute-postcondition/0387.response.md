The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the length of the permutation.
  - `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the duration of the game.
  - `P_B` and `P_S` are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation p.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a.

The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the context, it likely returns a value indicating the winner or the state of the game after `k` moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, which could be the winner or the state of the game after `k` moves.**
