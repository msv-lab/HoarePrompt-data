Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one or two elements, and `b` contains two elements. If `founds` is True, `s` contains one element which is `maxa`, and if `foundb` is True, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`), and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is False, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and if `foundb` is True, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is False, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`), and `founds` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than the new value of `i`, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one or two elements. If `founds` is true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `foundb` is true, `i` is incremented by 1, and the list `b` now includes the value `maxa` appended to it. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, and the list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is true, and `founds` is unknown. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than the new value of `i`, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `s` contains one or two elements. If `founds` is True, `s` contains one or two elements plus `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is True, and `b` now includes the value `a[pb - 1]` at the end of the list. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, the list `b` is updated to include the integer at index `pb - 1` from the list `a`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is True, and `i` is incremented by 1 if `founds` and `foundb` are not both true. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is now the integer value at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. If `founds` and `foundb` are both true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
