Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 2` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with three elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k], b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]]`, `pres` is a list with three elements `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k], s[k - 1] + s[k] + s[k + 1]]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `k + 1`.
- The lists `b` and `s` each have `k + 2` elements.
- `preb` remains the same with three elements: `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k], b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]]`.
- `pres` is updated by appending `ss + s[i]` to it. Since `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]` and `i` is `k + 1`, the new element appended to `pres` is `s[k - 1] + s[k] + s[k + 1]`. Therefore, `pres` now has three elements: `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k], s[k - 1] + s[k] + s[k + 1]]`.
- `sb` remains `b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]`.
- `ss` remains `s[k - 1] + s[k]`.
