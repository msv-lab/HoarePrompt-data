Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, and `len(s)` must be at least 3, `ptsb` is a list with two elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements where the first element is `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and the second element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `rem` is `k - 3`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `pres` remains a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, and `len(s)` must be at least 3.
- The value of `ptsb` remains a list with two elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`.
- The value of `ptss` remains a list with two elements where the first element is `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and the second element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`.
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 3` since `i` is 2.
