Output State: **`foundb` is True or False, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `founds` is True, `s` contains one element which is `maxa`, and if `foundb` is True, `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `s` contains one element which is `maxa`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`, where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
