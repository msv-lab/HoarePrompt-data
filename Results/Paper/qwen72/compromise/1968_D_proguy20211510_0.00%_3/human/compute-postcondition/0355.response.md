Output State: **`i` is `k`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 1` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with two elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k]]`, `pres` is a list with two elements `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k]]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1] + b[k]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `k`.
- `ss` is initially `s[k - 1]`.
- The code `ss += s[i]` adds `s[k]` to `ss`.
- Therefore, `ss` becomes `s[k - 1] + s[k]`.
- The other variables (`b`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`) remain unchanged.
