Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `rem` is `k - 1`.**

The value of `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 1` since `i` is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
