The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, the input should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
