Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `foundb`, and `founds` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, and `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False. These conditions remain unchanged.
- The list `b` now has a new element, which is the value of `maxa`.
