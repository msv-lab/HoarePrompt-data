Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 2. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to `ar[4]`.**
