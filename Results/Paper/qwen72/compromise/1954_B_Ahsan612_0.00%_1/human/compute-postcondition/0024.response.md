Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 3, `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is 1.**
