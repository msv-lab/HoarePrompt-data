The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
