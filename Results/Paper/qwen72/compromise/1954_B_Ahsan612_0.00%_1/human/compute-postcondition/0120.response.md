Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements in `ar`, and `same` is 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it is updated to the length of the first sequence of consecutive identical elements found in `ar`. If no such sequence is found, `minn` remains `inf` and the output is `-1`. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to `inf` and the output is the value of `minn`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of test cases.
- **`n`**: This variable is updated for each test case but is not affected by the loop body.
- **`a`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`ar`**: This variable is updated for each test case but is not modified by the loop body.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to the length of `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- **`num`**: After the loop finishes, `num` is the last element of `ar` because the loop updates `num` to the current element whenever a new sequence of identical elements is found.
- **`minn`**: This variable is updated to the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements found in `ar`. If no such sequence is found, `minn` remains `inf`, and the output is `-1`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum length of these sequences.
- **`same`**: After the loop finishes, `same` is 1 because the loop resets `same` to 1 whenever it encounters a new sequence of identical elements, and the final increment of `i` ensures that `same` is 1 when the loop ends.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has processed all test cases.
