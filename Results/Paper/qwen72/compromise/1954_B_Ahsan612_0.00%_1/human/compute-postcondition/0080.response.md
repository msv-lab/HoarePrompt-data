The only object in the loop head is the range defined by `int(input())`. This means the loop can execute a number of times specified by the user input. The state of the loop is not dependent on the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, or `same` directly, as they are not part of the loop head. However, the loop can execute one more time if the user input allows for it. Since the user input is not provided in the state, we cannot adjust it. Therefore, the state remains the same for the next iteration, except for the fact that the loop counter (represented by `_`) will be incremented, but this is not explicitly tracked in the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to `inf`.**
