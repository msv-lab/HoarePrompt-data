Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is now set to `inf`, `same` is 2, and the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar` (i.e., `ar[1] == num`).**
