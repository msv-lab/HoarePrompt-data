Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`.
   - The current value of `minn` is `inf` (infinity).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
