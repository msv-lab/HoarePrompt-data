Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 or 5 or 6, `same` is 4 or 3 or 2, `minn` is `inf` or 1, and `num` is `ar[2]` or `ar[4]`. If `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5 or 6 or 7, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 or 3, and `num` is `ar[4]` or `ar[5]` or `ar[6]`.**
