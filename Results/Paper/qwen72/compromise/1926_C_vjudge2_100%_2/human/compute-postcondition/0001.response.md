The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `a`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely based on `num`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is 0. Since `num` is already within a range that ensures it is not 0, no adjustments are needed for `num`. The state of `a` does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
