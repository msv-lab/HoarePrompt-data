Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it checks if the list `a` can be made non-decreasing by removing zero or one element. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
