The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements from the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.**
