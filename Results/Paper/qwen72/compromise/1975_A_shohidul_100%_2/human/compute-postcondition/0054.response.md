Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 1.
2. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
3. `n` must be greater than 1.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
6. `i` is 1.
7. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.
8. `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.
9. `check_all_new` is `False`.
10. `new_all` is `False`.
11. Additionally, `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`.

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides a contradiction: `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `False` and `True`. This is logically impossible, but for the purpose of this task, we will assume that the final state of these variables is `True` as stated in the additional information.
- The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
