To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- **`n`**: The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time (i.e., `i` = 2).

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `_` remains the same (0).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` remains the same (a list of integers provided by the user).
- `check_all` remains the same (`False`).
- `i` is now 2.
- The conditions involving `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain the same (if they were `True` or `False` before, they remain so).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.**
