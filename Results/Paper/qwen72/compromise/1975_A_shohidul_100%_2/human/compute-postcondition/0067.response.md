Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is also not used in the code snippet).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
