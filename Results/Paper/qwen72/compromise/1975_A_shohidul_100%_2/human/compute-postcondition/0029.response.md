Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end (or starting from index 1 to the end if `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`), `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
