The given code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis of the Initial State:
- `_` is 2.
- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is set to `n-1` if `check_all` is `False`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

### Explanation:
The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The value of `check_all` and the other variables are not used in the `print` statement itself.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
