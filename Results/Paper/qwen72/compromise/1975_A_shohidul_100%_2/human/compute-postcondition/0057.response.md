Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.
- `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `False`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
