Postcondition: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` ≤ `a[i]`, the values of `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged.**
