Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is increased by 1, `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\)**

The value of `number` remains within the specified range. The value of `size` has been increased by 1. The variable `value` is now equal to the expression \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\), which calculates the difference between 1 shifted left by `size` bits and 1 shifted left by `i` bits.
