To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Current State:
- `i` is greater than or equal to `0`
- `size` is `i + 3`
- `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`

### Loop Condition:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `size` and `i`.
   - `size` is defined as `i + 3`.

2. **Substitute `size` in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition can be rewritten as:
     ```
     while (1 << (i + 3 + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number:
     ```
   - Simplifying the expression inside the loop condition:
     ```
     while (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) <= number:
     ```

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) <= number` must be true.
   - The current state is `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, `size` is `i + 3`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`.
   - We need to ensure that `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) <= number` holds true.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is already greater than or equal to `0`, we need to ensure that `size` is adjusted to `i + 4` for the next iteration.
   - However, `size` is derived from `i`, so we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop condition holds.
   - The loop condition will hold if `i` is incremented by 1, making `size` equal to `i + 4`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1`.
- The new state will be:
  - `i` is `i + 1`
  - `size` is `i + 4`
  - `value` will be recalculated as `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << (i + 1))`

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `size` is `i + 4`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << (i + 1))`**
