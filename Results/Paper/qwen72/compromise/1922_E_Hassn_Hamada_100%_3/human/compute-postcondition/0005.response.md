To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `sequence`, and the parameters of the `range` function.

1. **`i`**: This variable will be set by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted manually.
2. **`sequence`**: The loop's ability to execute depends on the value of `max(sequence, default=0)`. If `sequence` is empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` will be 0, and the loop will not execute because the range will be from 0 to -1, which is invalid. Therefore, `sequence` must have at least one element.
3. **`max(sequence, default=0)`**: This function call ensures that if `sequence` is empty, the loop will start from 0. However, for the loop to execute, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than -1.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18
- `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0)

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `sequence` must have at least one element, and the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than -1.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element and the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (0, 0)**
