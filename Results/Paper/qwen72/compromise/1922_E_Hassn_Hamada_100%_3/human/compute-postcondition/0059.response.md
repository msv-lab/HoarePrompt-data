The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `size`, and `overlap`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `size - overlap` being greater than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1]`
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\)
- `i` is 1
- `overlap` is 0
- `size - overlap` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `size - overlap` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `overlap` is 0, `size` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 2, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than 2**
