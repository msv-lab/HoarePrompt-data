Output State: **`size` is increased by 2, `number` must be at least `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`, `i` is at least `0`, `(1 << i) <= number` is true, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `size` is incremented by 1, so it is now increased by 2 from its original value.
- The condition that `number` must be at least `(1 << size + 2) - (1 << i)` is updated to `number` must be at least `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` because `size` has been incremented.
- The condition that `i` is at least `0` remains unchanged.
- The condition that `(1 << i) <= number` remains true.
- The value of `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` because `size` has been incremented.
