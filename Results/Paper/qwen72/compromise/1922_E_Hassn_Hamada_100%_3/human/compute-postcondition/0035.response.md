Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`), `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i - 1`, and the current value of `value` is less than or equal to `number`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
