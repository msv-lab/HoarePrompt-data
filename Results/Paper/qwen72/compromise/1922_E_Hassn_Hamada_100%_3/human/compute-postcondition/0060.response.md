Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1, 2]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 2, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `sequence.append(i + overlap)` appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`.
- `i` is 2 and `overlap` is 0, so `i + overlap` is 2.
- The list `sequence` initially contains `[0, 1]`, and after appending 2, it becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.
- The values of `number`, `size`, `i`, and `overlap` remain unchanged.
- The condition `size - overlap` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
