To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over `i` starting from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\)
- `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\)
- `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`)
- If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `size_overlap`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The range is defined by `max(sequence, default=0)` and `-1`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.

3. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Given that `i` is `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i - 2`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - The next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`).

The other variables (`size`, `value`, and `size_overlap`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`), `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i - 1` if `value` is less than or equal to `number` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains unchanged.**
