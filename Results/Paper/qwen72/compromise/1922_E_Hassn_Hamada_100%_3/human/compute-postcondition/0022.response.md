Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\), `i` is `i - 1`, and `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.**

Explanation:
- `size` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\), which simplifies to \(2^{(i + 1)} - 2^i\). This is equivalent to \(2^i\).
- `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i - 1`.
- The precondition that `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1` remains valid.
- The value of `number` remains unchanged.
