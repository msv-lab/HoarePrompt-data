Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`number`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is only used in the loop condition and not modified inside the loop.
- **`size`**: The loop continues to increment `size` by 1 until the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\) is no longer true. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `size` will be the smallest integer for which this condition holds.
- **`value`**: The value of `value` is updated in each iteration to \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), where `size` is the current value of the `size` variable. After the loop finishes, `value` will be the last computed value before the condition failed, which is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\) where `size` is the final value determined by the loop.
