Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
