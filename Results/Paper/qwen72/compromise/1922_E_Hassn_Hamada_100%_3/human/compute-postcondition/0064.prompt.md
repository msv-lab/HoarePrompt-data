You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers that will be the output of the function. The function should either return -1 if no such array exists, or a list of integers of length at most 200, where each integer is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function. `number` is not equal to 0.
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i` where `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\) and `i` is the largest integer in the range of the loop for which the condition `value <= number` is true.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It is expected to return either -1 if no valid sequence exists, or a list of integers of length at most 200, where each integer is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, the function always returns 0, 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0, 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
