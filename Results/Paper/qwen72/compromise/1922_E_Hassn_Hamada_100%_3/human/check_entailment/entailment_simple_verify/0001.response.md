### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( n-1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence of integers that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It then appends a sequence of integers to `sequence` to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `number + 1`.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^k \) for some \( k \).
   - The loop in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly calculated.
   - The recursive call in `func_1` handles the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed.

5. **Verification**:
   - **For \( X = 2 \)**:
     - The program should generate an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
     - The output `[0]` is incorrect because it has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`).
     - A correct output for \( X = 2 \) could be `[0, 1]`, which has the subsequences `[], [0], [1], [0, 1]`.

   - **For \( X = 5 \)**:
     - The program should generate an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
     - The output `[0, 1, 0]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]`.

   - **For \( X = 13 \)**:
     - The program should generate an array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
     - The output `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [2], [2], [3], [4], [2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4]`.

   - **For \( X = 37 \)**:
     - The program should generate an array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences.
     - The output `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [-1], [-1], [0], [0], [2], [3], [-1], [-1, 0], [-1, 0], [-1, 2], [-1, 3], [-1, -1], [-1, -1, 0], [-1, -1, 0], [-1, -1, 2], [-1, -1, 3], [-1, -1, -1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 2, 3], [2, 3], [2, 2], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly. The output for \( X = 2 \) should be a sequence with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, but the program outputs `[0]`, which has only 1 increasing subsequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
