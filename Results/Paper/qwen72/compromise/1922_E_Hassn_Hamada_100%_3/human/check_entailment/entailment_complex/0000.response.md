Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the intended functionality as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Return Value in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` always returns `(0, 0)`, which is not the correct behavior. The function should either return `-1` if no valid array can be found, or it should modify the `sequence` list to contain the required array and return the appropriate values.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic inside the function `func_1` is flawed. The loop and the conditions used to determine the `size` and `overlap` do not correctly generate the required sequence. Specifically, the condition `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:` and the subsequent logic do not ensure that the sequence generated will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Incorrect Sequence Generation**: The sequence generated by the function does not necessarily meet the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The sequence is built by appending values in a way that does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call Issue**: The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` is not correctly reducing the problem to a smaller subproblem. The parameters passed to the recursive call are not correctly calculated to ensure the sequence will have the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Base Case Handling**: The base case handling in `func_1` is incorrect. If `number` is 0, the function should return `-1` to indicate that no valid sequence can be found, but it returns `(0, 0)` instead.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
