The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, and the range function. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `i` will be set to 3 for the first iteration of the loop, as specified by the range function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect the conditions under which the loop will start. Specifically, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` will be set to 3 by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
