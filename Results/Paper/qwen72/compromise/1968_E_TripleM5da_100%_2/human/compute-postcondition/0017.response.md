The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 3 and iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3**
