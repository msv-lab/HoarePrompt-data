The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`.

- The variable `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts, but in the loop head, `i` is initialized to 3 by the `range` function.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
