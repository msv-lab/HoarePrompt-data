Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the remaining points as (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not ensure that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|\} = \{0, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |3-3|, |3-3| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]
The optimal size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, but the program's output results in a set of size 5, which includes a duplicate distance (3). Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and is incorrect.
