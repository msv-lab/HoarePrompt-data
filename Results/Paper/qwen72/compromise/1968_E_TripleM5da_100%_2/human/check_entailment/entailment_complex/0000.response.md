Reasoning:

The task requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The function `func` attempts to achieve this by printing a specific sequence of points for each test case.

Let's break down the function and evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The function prints the point (1, 1).
   - It then prints the point (1, 2).
   - For each integer `i` from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it prints the point (i, i).

3. **Evaluation of the Output**:
   - The first two points (1, 1) and (1, 2) are always the same and contribute to the set \(\mathcal{H}\) with the distances 0 and 1.
   - The points (i, i) for \(3 \le i \le n\) are all on the diagonal of the grid, which means the Manhattan distance between any two such points (i, i) and (j, j) is \(|i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|\).

4. **Set of Distances**:
   - The distances between (1, 1) and (1, 2) are 0 and 1.
   - The distances between (1, 1) and (i, i) for \(3 \le i \le n\) are \(i - 1\).
   - The distances between (1, 2) and (i, i) for \(3 \le i \le n\) are \(i - 1 + 1 = i\).
   - The distances between (i, i) and (j, j) for \(3 \le i < j \le n\) are \(2|i - j|\).

5. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The function ensures that the distances 0, 1, and all values from 2 to \(2(n-2)\) are included in \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - This set of distances is indeed maximized for the given points, as it includes all possible distinct distances from 0 to \(2(n-2)\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the function correctly prints (1, 1) and (1, 2), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the function prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
