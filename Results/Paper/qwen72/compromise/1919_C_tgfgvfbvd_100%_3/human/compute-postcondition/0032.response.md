Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, `b` is `l[2]`, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, and `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, if `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[2]`, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 1.**
