Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
