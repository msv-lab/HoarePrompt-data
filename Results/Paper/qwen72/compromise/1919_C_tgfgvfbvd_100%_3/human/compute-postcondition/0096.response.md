Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `a` > `b`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then if `a` > `b`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, the element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `b`, and `a` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. `c` is increased by 1.***
