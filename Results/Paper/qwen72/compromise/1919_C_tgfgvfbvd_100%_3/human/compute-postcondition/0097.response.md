Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[0]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `l[0]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to `l[0]`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b` is updated to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then if `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to `l[0]`. Additionally, `c` is increased by 1.***
