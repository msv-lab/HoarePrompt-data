Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `a`, and the element at index `x` in the list `l` is less than or equal to `b`.**
