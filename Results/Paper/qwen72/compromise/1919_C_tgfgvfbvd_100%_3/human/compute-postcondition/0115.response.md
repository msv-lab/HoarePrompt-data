Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `x` is 2, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[2]` is greater than `a`, then `b` is equal to `l[2]` if `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
