Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`, `a` remains equal to `b`, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to infinity, and `c` is 1. In all cases, `a` and `b` are integers, and `c` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[1]`, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, and `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[2]`, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
