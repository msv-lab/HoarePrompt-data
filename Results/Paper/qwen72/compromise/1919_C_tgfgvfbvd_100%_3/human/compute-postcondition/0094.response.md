Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, the element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `a`. The element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `b`. `a` is now equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`.**
