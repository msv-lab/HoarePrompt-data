Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q`**: These are input integers.
2. **`a`**: This is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`.
3. **`b`**: This is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
4. **`c`**: This remains the same list.
5. **`l_i` and `r_i`**: These are the same as in the queries.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is described as a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`.
   - This means that each element in `a` is the sum of all previous elements in the original `a` up to that index.
   - For example, if the original `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then the cumulative sum `a` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `a` into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print all elements of the list `a`, which is the list of cumulative sums of the original `a`.

Since the exact original `a` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the cumulative sums. However, we can describe the output in terms of the cumulative sums.

Output: **[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of numbers where each number is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index.
