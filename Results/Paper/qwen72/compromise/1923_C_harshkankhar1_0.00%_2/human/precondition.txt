The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `q` queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). The array `c` contains integers `c_i` such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.
