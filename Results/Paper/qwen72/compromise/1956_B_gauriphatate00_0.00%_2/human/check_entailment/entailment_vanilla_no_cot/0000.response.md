Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of cards that the player has (`pairs`).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because the player can only score points for pairs that are not already matched by Nene, and Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. Therefore, the player can score at most `n // 2` points, which is the number of turns the player has where they can potentially score a point.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` and the list of cards `a` in the player's hand.
   - It calls `func_1` with the extracted values and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by considering the pairs of cards in their hand and the optimal play by Nene. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and efficiently processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.
