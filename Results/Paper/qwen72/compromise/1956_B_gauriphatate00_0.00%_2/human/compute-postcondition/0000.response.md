The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of `input` from its default (which is to read a line of input) to reading the entire input stream. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n and appears at most twice in the list, `input` is now the function `sys.stdin.read`.**
