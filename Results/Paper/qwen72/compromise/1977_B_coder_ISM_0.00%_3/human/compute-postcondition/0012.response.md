The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string '1' to the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list that contains '1' if the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `1` results in a non-zero value, and '0' otherwise. The code does not change the condition that determines the initial content of `s`, but it does append '1' to the list. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `s` is a list that now contains the string '1' appended to its previous content.**
