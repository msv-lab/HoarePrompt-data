Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be `length - 1`, `length` will remain either 30 or 31, and `s` will be a list of 30 or 31 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` will be 31, `s[30]` will be '1', and `s[29]` will be '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `length` will remain 30, `s` will remain a list of 30 elements, and `s[29]` will not be '0'. Additionally, any occurrences of the pattern '1' followed by '-1' in the list `s` will be replaced by '-1' followed by '0', starting from the beginning of the list and moving towards the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 29. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. The final value of `flag` will be determined as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If none of these conditions were met, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
