Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `s[29]` and `flag` remain unchanged. `s[29]` is now '-1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[29]` to '-1'. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged. The condition about `flag` and `s[29]` being '0' or '1' is no longer relevant because `s[29]` is now explicitly set to '-1'. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
