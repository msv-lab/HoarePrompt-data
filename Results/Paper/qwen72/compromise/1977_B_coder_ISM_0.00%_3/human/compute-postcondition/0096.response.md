Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `x` is an input integer. If the least significant bit (bit at position 0) of `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' followed by '1'. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' followed by '0'.***
