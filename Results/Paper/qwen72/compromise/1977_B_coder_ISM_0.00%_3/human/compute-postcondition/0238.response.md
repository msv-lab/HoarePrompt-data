Output State: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29), `s[2]` is '0', `s[1]` is '-1', `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**

Explanation:
- The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the list `s` at the index `i - 1` to be '-1'.
- Given that `i` is 2, the index `i - 1` is 1.
- Therefore, `s[1]` is now '-1'.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
