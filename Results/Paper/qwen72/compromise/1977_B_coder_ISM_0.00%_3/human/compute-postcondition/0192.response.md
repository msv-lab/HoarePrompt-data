Output State: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29), `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**

The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
