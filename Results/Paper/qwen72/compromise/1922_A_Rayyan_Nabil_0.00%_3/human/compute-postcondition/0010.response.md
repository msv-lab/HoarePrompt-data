Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'.
