Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If the first character of `a` at index 2 is not equal to the first character of `c` at index 2 and the first character of `b` at index 2 is not equal to the first character of `c` at index 2, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.***
