The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is not modified.**
