The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than `n`, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.**
