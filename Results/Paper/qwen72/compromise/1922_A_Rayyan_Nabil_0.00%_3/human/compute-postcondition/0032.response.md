Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `l` is 'YES'.**

The variable `l` is now set to 'YES'. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions for `l` being 'YES' or 'NO' based on the first characters of `a`, `b`, and `c` have not been checked yet, so `l` is simply set to 'YES' regardless of those conditions.
