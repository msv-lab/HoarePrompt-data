You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. For each iteration, if any character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program aims to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
   - The logic inside the loop checks if for each position `i` in the strings, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is true for all positions, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - However, if the condition is false for any position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the template matching.
   - The `else` block of the `for` loop is executed only if the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement. However, the program does not use a `break` statement, so the `else` block will always be executed after the loop.
   - This means that if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is true for any position, `l` will be set to 'YES', but it will be immediately overwritten to 'NO' after the loop completes.
   - Therefore, the program will always print 'NO' for each test case, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not, the program should:
     - Initialize `l` to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
     - Set `l` to 'NO' if it finds any position `i` where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`.
     - Print `l` after the loop completes.

5. **Corrected Program**:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           n = int(input())
           a = input()
           b = input()
           c = input()
           l = 'YES'
           for i in range(n):
               if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                   l = 'NO'
                   break
           print(l)
   ```

Given the logical flaw in the original program, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
