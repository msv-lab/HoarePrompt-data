The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving an n x n matrix and operations to maximize the sum of its elements. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the matrix size `n` and potentially other inputs as described in the problem. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a parameter `n` (an integer representing the size of the matrix) and possibly other parameters related to the matrix or operations, and return the maximized sum of the elements in the n x n matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (an integer representing the size of the matrix) and possibly other parameters related to the matrix or operations, and returns the maximized sum of the elements in the n x n matrix.**
