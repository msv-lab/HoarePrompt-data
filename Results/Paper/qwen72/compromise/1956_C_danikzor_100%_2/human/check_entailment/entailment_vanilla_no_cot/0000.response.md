Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not produce the correct maximum sum for the matrix. The formula used to calculate the maximum sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), is simply \( n^2 \times n \) because the maximum value each element can take is \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements in total. However, since the operations are performed using permutations, the maximum sum is actually \( n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \), which simplifies to \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * n // 2  # Correct formula for the maximum sum
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))  # Use the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))  # Use the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
```

In this corrected version, the maximum sum is calculated correctly using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \times n \). The operations are also correctly applied to maximize the sum by filling each row and each column with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values, leading to the maximum sum.
