### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Type 1 operation fills a row with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Type 2 operation fills a column with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column will be filled with this permutation, the total sum of the matrix will be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Verification of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the fact that each element in the matrix will be the sum of the row and column permutations.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 20 \).
   - These values match the expected maximum sums for the given problem.

5. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - However, the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) used in the program is incorrect for the maximum sum calculation.
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

### Correct Formula for Maximum Sum:
- The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) in each row and column is:
  \[
  \text{Maximum Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}
  \]

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \), not \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \).

Final: **False**
