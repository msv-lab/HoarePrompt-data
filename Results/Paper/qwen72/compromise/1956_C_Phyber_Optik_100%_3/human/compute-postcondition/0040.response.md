Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is `1`, which will be printed as is.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the range `range(1, n + 1)` will always include at least the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and n - 2 is the value of n - 2)**
