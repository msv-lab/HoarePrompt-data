Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is defined as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Understanding the `sum` variable:**
   - The formula for `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
   - This means `sum` is the sum of the cubes of all integers from 2 to `n`, plus 1.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, then `sum` would be \(1 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36\).

3. **Understanding the `n + n` expression:**
   - `n + n` is simply `2 * n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, then `n + n` would be \(3 + 3 = 6\).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(sum, n + n)` will print the value of `sum` and the value of `n + n`.

Given the initial state and the formula for `sum`, the output will be:
- The value of `sum` which is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
- The value of `n + n` which is `2 * n`.

Output: **sum, 2 * n (where sum is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\) and n is the value of n)**
