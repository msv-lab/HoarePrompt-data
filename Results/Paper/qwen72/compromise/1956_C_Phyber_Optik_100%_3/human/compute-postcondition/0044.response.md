Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is \( \text{previous\_n}^3 \), `i` is \(\text{previous\_n} + 1\), `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user. The values of `t`, `sum`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, but `sum`, `i`, and `j` are now expressed in terms of the previous value of `n` to maintain the initial state's conditions.
