Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2, `i` is 2, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**

The value of `sum` is updated to 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2, which simplifies to 1 + (4 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 3 * 2 = 1 + 6 = 7. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
