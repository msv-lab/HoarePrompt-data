Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is \(n\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `sum` remains unchanged and is still calculated as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still \(n + 1\).
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After the loop has executed all \(n\) iterations, `j` will be equal to \(n\).
