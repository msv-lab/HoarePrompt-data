Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and calculates a sum based on a specific formula. It then prints the sum followed by `2n`. Additionally, for each value from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line starts with `1` followed by `n - j + 1` and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with `2` followed by `n - j + 1` and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0, and the final state for each test case includes the calculated sum and the printed output. **
