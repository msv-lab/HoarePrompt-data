The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. After one iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n**.**
