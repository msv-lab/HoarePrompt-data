The value of `sum` is updated by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the current value of `sum`. Given that `i` is 3, we can calculate the expression as follows:

1. `i * i` is `3 * 3` which equals `9`.
2. `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `(3 - 1) * (3 - 1)` which equals `4`.
3. `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `9 - 4` which equals `5`.
4. `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is `5 * 3` which equals `15`.

So, `sum` is updated by adding `15` to its current value. The current value of `sum` is `7 + 2 * i * i - i`, which with `i` being 3, is `7 + 2 * 3 * 3 - 3` = `7 + 18 - 3` = `22`.

Therefore, the new value of `sum` is `22 + 15` = `37`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 37, `i` is 3**
