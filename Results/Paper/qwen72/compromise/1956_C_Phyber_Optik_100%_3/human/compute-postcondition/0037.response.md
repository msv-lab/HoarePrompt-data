Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is a precondition).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `sum` is \( n^3 \).
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant integer value `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
- The first argument `1` will be printed as `1`.
- The second argument `n - 1` will be printed as `n - 1`.
- The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Example:
- If `n` is 3, the range will be `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The print statement will output: `1, 2, 1, 2, 3`.

### General Case:
- For any `n` greater than or equal to 1, the output will be: `1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is the range from 1 to n inclusive)**
