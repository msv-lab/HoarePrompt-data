Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 22 + (4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4, `i` is 4, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**

In natural language: The value of `sum` is updated to 22 plus the result of the expression (4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4, which equals 22 + (16 - 9) * 4 = 22 + 7 * 4 = 22 + 28 = 50. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 50, `i` is 4, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\).
