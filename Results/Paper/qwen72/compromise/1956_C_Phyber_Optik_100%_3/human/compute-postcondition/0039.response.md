The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3**
