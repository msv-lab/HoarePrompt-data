Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- **`n`**: This variable must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at all.
- **`sum`**: The `sum` variable is updated in each iteration of the loop. The final value of `sum` is the initial value (1) plus the sum of the expression \((k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\) for all \(k\) from 2 to \(n\). This expression simplifies to \(2k - 1\) for each \(k\), so the final `sum` can be written as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1)\).
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be \(n + 1\) because the loop iterates from 2 to \(n\), and the `i` value is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
- **`j`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still \(\text{previous\_n}\).
