Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(sum, n + n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `sum` is calculated as \( n^3 \).
   - `n + n` is simply \( 2n \).

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `sum` and the value of `n + n`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **\( n^3 \), \( 2n \) (where \( n \) is the input integer)**
