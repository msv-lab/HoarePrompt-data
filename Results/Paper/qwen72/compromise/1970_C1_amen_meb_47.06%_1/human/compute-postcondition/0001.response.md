For the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be checked or adjusted for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will always execute at least once because the condition `True` is always true.

State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the function implicitly works with a tree structure that has exactly two leaves, the tree is represented by a series of edges (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node u_1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, and `numbers` is an empty list.**
