To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "="
- `i` is `len(pans) - 1`
- `n` is an input integer

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` in the loop head is determined by the `range` function, which starts at 1. Therefore, `i` does not need to be adjusted; it will be set to 1 by the loop itself.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and the initial value of `i`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and can remain as they are.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
