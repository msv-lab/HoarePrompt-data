Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0 (at the start of the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Given this information, let's determine what will be printed by the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Explanation:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `mak`: This is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<". Since the exact value of `mak` is not provided, we can only describe it as the largest `i` where the user input was "<".
- `mak2`: This is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
- `i`: This is 0, as stated in the initial state.
- `mak2`: This is again equal to `mak`.

### Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<")**
