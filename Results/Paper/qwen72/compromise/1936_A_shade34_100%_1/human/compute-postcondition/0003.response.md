To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized to 1 in the loop head (`for i in range(1, n)`). This means that `i` starts at 1 and will increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:** For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` were 1 or less, the range `range(1, n)` would be empty, and the loop would not run.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0**
