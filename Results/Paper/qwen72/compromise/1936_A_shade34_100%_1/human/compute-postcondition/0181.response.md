Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1` (which implies `i` is incremented by 1).
- `s` is the input string.
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is set to the value of `i`.
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is updated to include the value of `i`.
- Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.
- `mak2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is undefined or has some default value (e.g., `None`).

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
2. **`mak`**: 
   - If `s` is `<`, `mak` is set to the value of `i`.
   - If `s` is not `<`, `mak` remains undefined or has some default value (e.g., `None`).
3. **`mak2`**: Since `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, it will be `None` unless it is defined elsewhere in the code.
4. **`pans`**: 
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is updated to include the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.

### Output:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

Given the initial state and the conditions:
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` will be the value of `i`.
- If `s` is not `<`, `mak` will be `None`.
- `mak2` will always be `None` unless defined elsewhere.
- `i` will be the incremented value of `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] None [i] None (where [mak] is the value of `i` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `None`, and [i] is the incremented value of `i`)**
