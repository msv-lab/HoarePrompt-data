The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<", in which case `mak` is 2.**
