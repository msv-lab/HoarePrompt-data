The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is [0] if `s` is "<", otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not "=", or `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is "=", `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is the user input string.**
