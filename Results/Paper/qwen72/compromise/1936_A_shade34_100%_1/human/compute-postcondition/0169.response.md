To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Variables in the `print` Statement:
- `mak`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `mak2`: This variable is also not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `i`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

### Analysis:
- Since `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are not defined in the initial state, their values are unknown.
- The `print` statement will attempt to print these variables along with the string `'?'`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. Since the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are unknown, they will be printed as they are.

Output: **? mak mak2 i mak2 (where mak, mak2, and i are undefined variables)**
