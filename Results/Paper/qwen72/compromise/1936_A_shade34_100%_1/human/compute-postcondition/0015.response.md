Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<", in which case `mak` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input is "<", then `mak` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is "<":
     - `mak` will be 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input is anything other than "<":
     - `mak` will be 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will depend on the user input. Therefore, the possible outputs are:

- If the user input is "<":
  Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
- If the user input is anything other than "<":
  Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the user input is not specified, both scenarios are possible. However, without additional context, we can only provide the two possible outputs based on the given conditions.
