Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=".
   - `i` is `len(pans)`.
   - `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`.
   - If the current user input is "<", then `mak` is set to `len(pans) - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` is initially 0. If the current user input is "<", then `mak` is set to `len(pans) - 1`.
   - `i` is `len(pans)`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`, `i` (which is `len(pans)`) is a valid non-negative integer.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will print a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the current user input is "<":
     - `mak` will be `len(pans) - 1`.
     - `i` will be `len(pans)`.
   - If the current user input is not "<":
     - `mak` will remain 0.
     - `i` will still be `len(pans)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If the current user input is "<":
  Output: **? len(pans) - 1 len(pans) - 1 len(pans) len(pans)**
- If the current user input is not "<":
  Output: **? 0 0 len(pans) len(pans)**

Since the exact user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, if we assume the current user input is "<" (as it is a common scenario in such problems), the output would be:

Output: **? len(pans) - 1 len(pans) - 1 len(pans) len(pans)**

If the current user input is not "<", the output would be:

Output: **? 0 0 len(pans) len(pans)**

To provide a more precise answer based on the given information, we can generalize:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is 0 if the current user input is not "<" and len(pans) - 1 if it is "<", and [i] is len(pans))**
