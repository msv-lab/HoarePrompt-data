Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `s` is the new user input string.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s` is "<":
     - `mak` and `mak2` are both set to 1.
     - `pans` is [1].
   - If `s` is not "<" but is either "=" or any other value:
     - `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is "<" or "=".
     - Otherwise, `pans` is [1].

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

### Analysis:
- **Case 1: `s` is "<"**
  - `mak` and `mak2` are both set to 1.
  - `i` remains 2.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 1`.

- **Case 2: `s` is not "<" but is "=" or any other value**
  - `mak` and `mak2` remain their initial values (which are the same).
  - `i` remains 2.
  - The print statement will output: `? [initial mak] [initial mak2] 2 [initial mak2]`.

### Final Output:
- If `s` is "<":
  Output: **? 1 1 2 1**

- If `s` is not "<" but is "=" or any other value:
  Output: **? [initial mak] [initial mak2] 2 [initial mak2]**

Since the exact initial values of `mak` and `mak2` are not provided, the output for the second case will depend on those initial values. However, if we assume the initial values are the same as `mak` and `mak2` being equal, the output will be consistent with the initial state.

For the sake of completeness, let's assume the initial values of `mak` and `mak2` are the same and not specified further. Therefore, the output for the second case would be:

Output: **? [initial mak] [initial mak2] 2 [initial mak2]**
