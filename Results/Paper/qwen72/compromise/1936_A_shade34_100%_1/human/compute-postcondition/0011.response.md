The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the standard output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written immediately to the output. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<", in which case `mak` is 1**. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the output buffer has been flushed.
