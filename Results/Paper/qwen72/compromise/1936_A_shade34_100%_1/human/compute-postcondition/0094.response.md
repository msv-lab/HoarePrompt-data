Output State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pans = []` initializes `pans` as an empty list.
- The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
