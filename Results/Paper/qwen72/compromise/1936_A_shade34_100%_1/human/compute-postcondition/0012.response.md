Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. The initial condition that `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<" (in which case `mak` is 1) is overridden by the assignment `mak = i`. Therefore, `mak` is now 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
