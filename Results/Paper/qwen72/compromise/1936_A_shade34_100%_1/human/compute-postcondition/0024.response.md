Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is an empty list.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the console or output stream, but it does not affect the values of any variables in the current state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
