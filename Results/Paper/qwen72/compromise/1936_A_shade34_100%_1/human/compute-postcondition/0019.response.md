Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `mak` will be the last value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to "<" during the loop's execution. If no such input was received, `mak` will remain 0.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, as it increments from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `mak` will hold the value of the last `i` for which the user input was "<". If the user never provided "<" as input during any iteration, `mak` will stay at 0.
