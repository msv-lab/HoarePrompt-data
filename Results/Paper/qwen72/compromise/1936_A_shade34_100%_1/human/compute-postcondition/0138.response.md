To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `mak` is 0 or `n-1`.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
- `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- The last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `n`.
- `len(pans)` is at least `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < len(pans)` must still hold true.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently `n`, it should be incremented to `n + 1`.
2. **Check Condition**: The loop will execute if `i < len(pans)`. Given that `len(pans)` is at least `n + 1`, the condition `i < len(pans)` will be true if `i` is `n + 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `len(pans)` is at least `n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`mak` is 0 or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
