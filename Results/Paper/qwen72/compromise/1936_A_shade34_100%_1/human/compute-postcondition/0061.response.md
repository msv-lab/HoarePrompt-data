Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `mak` is either 0 or 1.
- `mak2` is 0 (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` can be either 0 or 1, `pans[mak]` will be either the first element (`pans[0]`) or the second element (`pans[1]`) of the list `pans`.
2. **`pans[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, `pans[i]` will be the third element (`pans[2]`) of the list `pans`.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 0, the print statement will be:
  ```python
  print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[2], pans[2])
  ```
  This will print the first element of `pans` twice, followed by the third element of `pans` twice.
- If `mak` is 1, the print statement will be:
  ```python
  print('?', pans[1], pans[1], pans[2], pans[2])
  ```
  This will print the second element of `pans` twice, followed by the third element of `pans` twice.

### Final Output:
Since `mak` can be either 0 or 1, the output will depend on the value of `mak`. However, we can describe the output in a general form:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where [pans[mak]] is the element at index `mak` of the list `pans` and [pans[2]] is the third element of the list `pans`)**
