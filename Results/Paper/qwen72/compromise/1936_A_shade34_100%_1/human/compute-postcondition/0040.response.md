Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` is `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is `[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`.
- The initial state specifies that `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, and `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`.
- After appending `i` (which is 1), `pans` becomes `[1]` regardless of the value of `s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
