The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). For each test case, the function removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list, prints the modified list, counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the results (modified lists and zero counts) have been printed. The function does not return any values.
