Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, and `a` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `res` is 1 or 2 depending on the value of `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Initially, `res` was 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[0]`. After the increment, `res` will be 1 if `a[0]` was 0, or 2 if `a[0]` was 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
