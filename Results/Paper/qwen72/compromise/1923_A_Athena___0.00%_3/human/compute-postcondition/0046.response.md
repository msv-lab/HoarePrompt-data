Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and at least one trailing zero removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` initially has at least one trailing zero, after `a.pop()`, the list `a` will have all leading zeros removed and at least one trailing zero removed. The length of `a` is now one less than its initial length, so `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
