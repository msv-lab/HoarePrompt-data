Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0 if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i]`) is not 0. If the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i]`) is 0, `res` is 1.***
