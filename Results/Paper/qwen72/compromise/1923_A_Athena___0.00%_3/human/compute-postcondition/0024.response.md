The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, and `a` must have at least one element. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1 and the length of `a` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, and `a` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `res` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[0]`**
