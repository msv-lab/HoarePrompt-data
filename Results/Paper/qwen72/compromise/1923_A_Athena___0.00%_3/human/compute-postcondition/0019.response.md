To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `res` is 0.

2. **Understanding `a`**:
   - The list `a` is provided by the user.
   - Leading zeros are removed from the list.
   - Trailing zeros are removed from the list.

3. **What will be printed**:
   - The `print(a)` statement will output the list `a` after the leading and trailing zeros have been removed.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions. The list `a` will be printed as it is, but without any leading or trailing zeros.

Output: **a (where a is the list of integers provided by the user with all leading and trailing zeros removed)**
