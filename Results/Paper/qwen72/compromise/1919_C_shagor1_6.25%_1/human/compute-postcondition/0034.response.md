Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is the last element of `inp`.
- `_` is 0.
- `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
- `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`).
- `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `inp`**:
   - `inp` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements.
   - The exact values of the elements in `inp` are not provided, but we know it contains at least `n` integers.

2. **Finding `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, provided it exists and is different from `x`.
   - If all elements in `inp` are the same, `y` does not exist, and the problem does not specify what happens in this case. For the sake of this analysis, we assume `y` exists and is different from `x`.

3. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - This means we need to count how many elements in `inp` are strictly greater than the smallest and the second smallest elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `inp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `inp`)**
