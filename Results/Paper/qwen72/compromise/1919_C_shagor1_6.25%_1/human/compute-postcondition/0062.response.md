Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is the third element of `inp`.**

The value of `y` is now the same as the third element of the list `inp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
