Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `ans` is 1 if the second element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `y` is the second element of `inp`.**
