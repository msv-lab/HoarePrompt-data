The code snippet `x == y` is a comparison that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `x` and `y` are both defined as `n + 1`, the comparison will always evaluate to `True`. However, this comparison does not change any variable values. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `x == y` evaluates to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is greater than `y`, and `x == y` evaluates to `True`.**
