The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, we only need to consider `testcases`.

At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 1, and `func_6()` has been called and has returned. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 1, but it will be decremented by 1 as the loop progresses.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, `func_6()` has been called, and `func_6()` has returned.**
