Postcondition: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` is the length of `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9 and `F` must have at least one element, `f` is the first element of `F`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the element which, together with the previous element, forms the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
