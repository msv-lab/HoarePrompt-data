Output State: **`l` is 1 less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is not true, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements).**

Explanation:
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. Since `l` is 1 less than `h`, `h - l` is 1, and `(h - l) // 2` is 0. Therefore, `mid` is equal to `l`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
