Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Total Matches Calculation**: The calculation of `total_matchs` is incorrect. The total number of matches played should be the total points divided by 2, but it should also be checked if the total points can be achieved by valid games (i.e., the total points should be even and the points should be consistent with the possible outcomes of the games).

2. **Draws Calculation**: The formula for calculating the number of draws is not correct. The number of draws should be maximized while ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins and losses.

3. **Validation of Scores**: The validation of scores is not comprehensive. The solution should ensure that the scores can be achieved by a valid sequence of games, and the total number of matches should be consistent with the possible outcomes.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_wins = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_wins:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = total_points // 2
        if p1 + p2 + p3 < 2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1):
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the number of wins and losses
        wins = (p3 - p2) + (p3 - p1)
        if wins > total_wins:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Remaining points after accounting for wins
        remaining_points = total_points - 2 * wins
        if remaining_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        resultats.append(remaining_points // 2)
    return resultats

# Test the function
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Total Points Check**: Ensure that the total points are even, as each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points.
2. **Total Wins Check**: Ensure that the highest score `p3` is not greater than the total number of wins, which is `total_points // 2`.
3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is half the total points, but we need to account for the wins and losses first.
4. **Calculate Wins and Losses**: The number of wins is the sum of the differences between the highest score and the other two scores.
5. **Remaining Points Check**: After accounting for the wins, the remaining points should be even and represent the number of draws.

This corrected solution should handle all the test cases correctly.
