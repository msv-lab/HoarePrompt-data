Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, if no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, `no` is True. If any character in `c` is found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, `no` is False.***
