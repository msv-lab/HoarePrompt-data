The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `tests`. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `tests` should be an integer representing the number of test cases, which must be at least 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0**
