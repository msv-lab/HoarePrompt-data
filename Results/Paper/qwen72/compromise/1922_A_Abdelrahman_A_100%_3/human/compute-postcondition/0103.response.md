The function `func` accepts no arguments. However, within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
