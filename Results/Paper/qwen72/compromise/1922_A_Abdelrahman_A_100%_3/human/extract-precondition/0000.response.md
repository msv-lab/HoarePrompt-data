Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).**
