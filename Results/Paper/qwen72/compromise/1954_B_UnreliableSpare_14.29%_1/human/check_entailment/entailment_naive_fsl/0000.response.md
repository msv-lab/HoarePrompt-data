Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it attempts to solve the problem. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, prints `-1`. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed.

### Issue:
The program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by iterating through the array and counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). It then takes the minimum of these counts as the answer. This approach does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider another input:
```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing any one of the middle elements (either the second or the third) will make the array non-beautiful.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- For the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, the program will count the number of consecutive `1`s at the start and end, which is `2` (at the start) and `2` (at the end). It will then take the minimum of these counts, which is `2`.
- However, removing just one element (either the second or the third) will make the array non-beautiful. For example, removing the second element results in `[1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful because no operation can be applied to it to make all elements the same.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
