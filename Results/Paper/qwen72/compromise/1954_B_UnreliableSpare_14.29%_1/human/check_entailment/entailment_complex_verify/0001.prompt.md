You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The value of `flag` will be `False` if any two consecutive elements in the list `arr` are different. Otherwise, `flag` will remain `True`. The values of `n` and `arr` will remain unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` at the end of the list or before a different element is encountered.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered or the value of `cnt`, whichever is smaller.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered or the value of `cnt`, whichever is smaller, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` at the end of the list or before a different element is encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered. The function does not modify the input variables `n` or `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `val`.
   - For each segment of consecutive elements equal to `val`, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of such elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not all the same, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Use of `Decimal`**:
  - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` to represent infinity.
  - This does not affect the correctness of the program but is not a common practice for this type of problem.

- **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of such segments.
  - This approach does not correctly handle the problem of making the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. It should consider the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the array being beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
- To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
- One way to achieve this is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the array being beautiful. This can be done by:
  - Counting the number of elements that are part of the pattern.
  - Removing the minimum number of elements to break the pattern.

### Correctness:
- The current program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
