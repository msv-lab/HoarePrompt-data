The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in a list `char_count` of 26 zeros, which is then converted to a corresponding lowercase letter. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
