The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0**
