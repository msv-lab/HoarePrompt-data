Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order.** 

The `output1` list has been reversed, meaning the order of its elements is now from the largest to the smallest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The values of `x` and `output2` remain unchanged.
