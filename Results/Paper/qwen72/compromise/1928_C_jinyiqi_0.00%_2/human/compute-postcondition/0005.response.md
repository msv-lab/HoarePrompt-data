Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is a list containing `[x]`, `i` is 1, and `x % i == 0`.**

The value of `x` remains an integer within the specified range. The list `output1` still contains `[1]`. The list `output2` now contains the value of `x` after the code appends `int(x / i)` to it. The value of `i` remains 1, and the condition `x % i == 0` is still valid.
