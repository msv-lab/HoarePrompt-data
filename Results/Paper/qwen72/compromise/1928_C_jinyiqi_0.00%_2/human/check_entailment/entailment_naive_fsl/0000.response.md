Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the constraints and the calculation of possible values for `k`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, but the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed.

### Issue:
1. **Divisor Calculation and Validation**:
   - The program calculates the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value. However, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is not sufficient to ensure that the `k` value is valid according to the problem description.
   - The problem description states that the settling repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the valid `k` values should be such that Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received are consistent with the described pattern.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program should output `4` because `k = 2, 3, 5, 6` are valid.
- However, the program's logic for determining valid `k` values is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly.

### Specific Case:
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program calculates the divisors of `10 + 2 - 2 = 10` and `10 - 2 = 8`.
- The divisors of `10` are `[1, 2, 5, 10]`, and the divisors of `8` are `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- The program then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value, but it does not correctly filter out invalid `k` values.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
2. For each divisor `s`, check if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value by ensuring that the position `n` and the number `x` are consistent with the described pattern.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
