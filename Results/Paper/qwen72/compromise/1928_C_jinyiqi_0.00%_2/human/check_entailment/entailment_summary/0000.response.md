### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered from \( k-1 \) down to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya is at position \( n \) and received number \( x \). We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( k \), the positions where Vasya could receive number \( x \) are:
     - \( x \) in the first \( k \) positions: \( x, x + (2k-2), x + 2(2k-2), \ldots \)
     - \( k - x + 1 \) in the next \( k-2 \) positions: \( k - x + 1, k - x + 1 + (2k-2), k - x + 1 + 2(2k-2), \ldots \)

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( k > 1 \)
   - \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \)

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values: \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It then calls `func_1` on these values to find their divisors.
   - The divisors are checked to see if they fit the pattern and are added to the output list if they do.
   - The output list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then printed.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns a list of all divisors of \( x \) in decreasing order.
   - This is achieved by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checking for divisors, then combining the divisors and reversing the list to get the desired order.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the positions where Vasya could receive number \( x \) by considering the two possible positions: \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It uses the divisors of these positions to find the possible values of \( k \).
   - The divisors are checked to ensure they are valid \( k \) values (i.e., \( k > 1 \) and \( k \ge x \)).
   - The program correctly removes duplicates by converting the output list to a set before printing the result.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and the pattern described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
