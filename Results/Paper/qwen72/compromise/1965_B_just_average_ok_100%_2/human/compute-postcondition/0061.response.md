The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the length of `nums` must be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 2, and the number of iterations remaining is one less than before. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.**
