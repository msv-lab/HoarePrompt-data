Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`, which is `1 - 1`, resulting in `idx` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
