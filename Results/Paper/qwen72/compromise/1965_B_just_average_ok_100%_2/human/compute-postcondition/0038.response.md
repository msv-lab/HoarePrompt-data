Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 2, `len(nums)` is greater than 2, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` sets the value of `idx` to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
