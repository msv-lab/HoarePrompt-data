The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `len(nums)` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `len(nums)` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 1, `idx` is -1, `len(nums)` is greater than 1**
