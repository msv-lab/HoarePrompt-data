Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
2. `n` is an input positive integer (not used in the code).
3. `k` is an input positive integer.
4. `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
5. The value `k - nums[idx]` is appended at the end of `nums`.
6. The value `k + 1` is appended at the end of `nums`.
7. The value `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end of `nums`.
8. The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
9. `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
10. `idx` is `i - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial List `nums`:**
   - `nums` starts as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\):
     \[
     \text{nums} = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
     \]

2. **Appending Values:**
   - `k - nums[idx]` is appended.
   - `k + 1` is appended.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended.

3. **Removing a Value:**
   - The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Finding Index `i`:**
   - `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.

5. **Calculating `idx`:**
   - `idx` is `i - 1`.

### Determining the Length of `nums`:
1. **Initial Length:**
   - The initial length of `nums` is 21 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).

2. **Appending Values:**
   - Three values are appended: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - This increases the length of `nums` by 3.

3. **Removing a Value:**
   - One value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed.
   - This decreases the length of `nums` by 1.

4. **Final Length:**
   - Initial length: 21
   - Appended values: +3
   - Removed value: -1
   - Final length: \(21 + 3 - 1 = 23\)

### Output:
The code prints the length of the list `nums`.
Output: **23**
