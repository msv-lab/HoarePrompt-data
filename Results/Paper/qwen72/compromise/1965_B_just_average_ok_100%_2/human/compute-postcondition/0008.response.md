Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is -1, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
