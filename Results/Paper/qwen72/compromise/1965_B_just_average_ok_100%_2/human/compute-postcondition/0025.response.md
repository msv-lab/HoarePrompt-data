The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are already positive integers, and the list `nums` is defined with specific elements. However, the new values of `n` and `k` will overwrite the existing ones.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` appended, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end, but without the element `1 << idx`. `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**
