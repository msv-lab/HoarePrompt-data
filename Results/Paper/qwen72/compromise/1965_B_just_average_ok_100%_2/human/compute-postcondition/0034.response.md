Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 1, `idx` is 0, `len(nums)` is greater than 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
