Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 2, `len(nums)` is greater than 2. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.**
