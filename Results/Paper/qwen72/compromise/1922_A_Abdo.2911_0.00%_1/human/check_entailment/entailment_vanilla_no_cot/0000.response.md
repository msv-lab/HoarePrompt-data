Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the template and checks for matches. Here are the issues:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs the template by appending the lowercase letter if `a[i] == b[i]`, and the uppercase version of `a[i]` otherwise.
   - This approach does not ensure that the template will correctly handle cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but still match the template, and it does not correctly handle cases where `c[i]` should not match the template.

2. **Match Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by ensuring that if the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same, and if the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - However, it does not correctly check the condition for `c` to ensure that `c` does not match the template. Specifically, it checks if `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character, which is incorrect because `c` should not match the template at all.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Construct the template such that `a` and `b` match it.
2. Ensure that `c` does not match the template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Initialize the template with None
        template = [None] * n
        
        # Construct the template
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template[i] = a[i]  # Both a and b have the same character
            else:
                template[i] = a[i].upper()  # a and b have different characters
        
        # Check if a and b match the template
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        # Check if c does not match the template
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Template Construction**:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, the template character is set to the lowercase `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template character is set to the uppercase `a[i]`.

2. **Match Checking**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must be different from the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
