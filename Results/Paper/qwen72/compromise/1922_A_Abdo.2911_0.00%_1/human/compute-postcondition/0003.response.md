The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string that is the concatenation of `a`, `b`, and `c` in that order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string that is the concatenation of `a`, `b`, and `c` in that order.**
