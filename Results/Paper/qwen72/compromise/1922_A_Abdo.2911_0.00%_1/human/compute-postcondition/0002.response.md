Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read n, a, b, and c from the input. After processing, it will print 'YES' if the conditions for matching a and b with the template are met and c does not match the template, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The variables n, a, b, and c will be overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be the values from the last iteration. The template list will be reset and recalculated in each iteration, so its final state will be the result of the last iteration's calculations.**
