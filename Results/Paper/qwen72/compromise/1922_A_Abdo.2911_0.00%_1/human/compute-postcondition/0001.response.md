The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` does not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is a placeholder variable, `t` must be greater than 0**
