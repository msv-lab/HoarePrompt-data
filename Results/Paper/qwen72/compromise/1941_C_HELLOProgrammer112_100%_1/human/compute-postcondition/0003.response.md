Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the printed output will contain `t` lines, each corresponding to the result for a test case. The variables `a` and `s` are updated for each test case, but they do not persist outside the function. **
