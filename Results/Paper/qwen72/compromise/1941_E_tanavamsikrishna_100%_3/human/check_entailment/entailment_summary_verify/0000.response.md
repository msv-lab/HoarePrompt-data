### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(row, d: int)`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river, given the maximum distance `d` between supports.
- **Behavior**:
  - It initializes the first cell with a cost of 1 (since the depth is 0 and the cost is `a_{i,1} + 1`).
  - It then iterates over the first `d` cells, adding 2 to the cost of each cell (this is incorrect as it does not follow the problem's constraints).
  - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last `d` cells.
  - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it updates the cost by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the current cell's depth plus 1.
  - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: This function processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Behavior**:
  - It reads the input, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
  - It reads the depths of the river cells for each row.
  - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then finds the minimum sum of `k` consecutive row costs and prints this minimum sum.

### Evaluation of `func_1`:
- **Initial Cost Calculation**:
  - The function sets `row[0] = 1`, which is correct because the cost of installing a support in the first column is always 1.
  - However, the loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` is incorrect. This loop adds 2 to the cost of each cell in the first `d` cells, which does not align with the problem's constraints. The correct approach should be to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

- **Heap Management**:
  - The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last `d` cells.
  - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it updates the cost by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the current cell's depth plus 1.
  - This approach is intended to ensure that the distance constraint is met, but the initial cost calculation error propagates through the entire row.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 100 0 100 0
```
- **Expected Output**: The optimal placement of supports would be at the first, third, and last columns, resulting in a total cost of `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
- **Actual Output**:
  - `func_1` will incorrectly calculate the cost for the second cell as `100 + 2 = 102`.
  - The cost for the third cell will be `0 + 1 + 102 = 103`.
  - The cost for the fourth cell will be `100 + 1 + 102 = 203`.
  - The cost for the fifth cell will be `0 + 1 + 102 = 103`.
  - The final cost returned by `func_1` will be `103`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the installation of supports according to the problem's constraints, particularly the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The initial cost calculation error and the subsequent propagation of this error lead to incorrect cost calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
