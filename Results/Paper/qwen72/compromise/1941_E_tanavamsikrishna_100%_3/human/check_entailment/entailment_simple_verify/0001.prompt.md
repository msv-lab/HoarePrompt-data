You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since a support must be installed there).
   - It then iterates through the first `d` cells, adding 2 to the cost of each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the installation cost).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the cells within the sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the nearest support is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the cost of the current cell to the minimum cost from the heap, and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost for the entire row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid (a list of `n` rows, each with `m` cells).
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n * m` does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
   - The function correctly installs supports in the first and last columns.
   - The function ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

5. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for each cell is efficiently calculated.
   - The sliding window approach with the heap is appropriate for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance `d`.
   - The function correctly sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

6. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the output is printed as required.
   - The function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and uses an efficient algorithm to find the minimum cost.

Correctness: **True**
