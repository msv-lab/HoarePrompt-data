### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers, representing the depths of the river cells.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - The function starts by setting `row[0]` to 1 and increasing the values of `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` by 2. This ensures that the first support is installed at the river bank and the next `d-1` cells have their costs increased by 2.
   - **Heap Initialization:**
     - A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of the row, which is used to keep track of the minimum cost support within the sliding window of size `d`.
   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop iterates over the remaining elements of the row, starting from `d` to `m-1`.
     - It pops elements from the heap until the index of the popped element is within the valid range for the current cell.
     - The cost of the current cell is updated by adding the minimum cost support within the sliding window and 1.
     - The updated cost and the current index are pushed back into the heap.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total cost of installing supports on the row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - The function calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of installing supports on that row.
   - **Sliding Window Sum:**
     - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Output:**
     - The minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is printed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is equal to `k` or `m` is small.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should not exceed the given limits.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly ensures that the first and last supports are installed at the river banks.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost support within the sliding window is always used, which is necessary to minimize the total cost.
   - The sliding window sum approach is appropriate for finding the minimum total cost of `k` consecutive bridges.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of a min-heap and the sliding window sum approach are appropriate for the given constraints and problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True**
