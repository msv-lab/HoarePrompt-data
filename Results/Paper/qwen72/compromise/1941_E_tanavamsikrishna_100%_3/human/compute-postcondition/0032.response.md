To adjust the program state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(d, len(row)):
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.

### Current State:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`.
- `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfied the loop condition.
- `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `i` is currently greater than or equal to `d + 5`, the next value of `i` will be `d + 6`.
2. **`row` and `min_heap`**: The state of `row` and `min_heap` will be modified within the loop body, but for the loop to execute again, we only need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range.
3. **`d`**: `d` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
4. **`len(row)`**: The length of `row` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

### New State:
- `i` is now `d + 6`.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(row)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfied the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
