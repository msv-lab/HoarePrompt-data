The code `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the element `e` into the min-heap `min_heap`.

Given the initial state:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is greater than `d + 2`.
- `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap.
- `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

The impact of the code:
- The element `e` is added to the min-heap `min_heap`.
- The structure of the min-heap is maintained, meaning the heap property (parent node is less than or equal to its children) is preserved.
- The values of `row`, `d`, `i`, and the existing elements in `min_heap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than `d + 2`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
