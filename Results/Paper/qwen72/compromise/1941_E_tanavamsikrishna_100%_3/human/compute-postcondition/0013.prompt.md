You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The first line of input contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100 and 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The next n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, where 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` must be at least `k`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, starting from index `0` to `n - k`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any k consecutive elements in the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from the standard input, which includes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. It returns a value based on the input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
