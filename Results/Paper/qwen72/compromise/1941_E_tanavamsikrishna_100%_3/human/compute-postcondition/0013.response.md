Functionality: ** The function reads input from the standard input, which includes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. It calculates the cost for each row using a helper function `func_1` and then finds the minimum sum of `k` consecutive row costs. The function prints this minimum sum. After the function concludes, `n` is at least `k`, `costs` is a list of length `n`, and `total_costs` is a list with `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`. **
