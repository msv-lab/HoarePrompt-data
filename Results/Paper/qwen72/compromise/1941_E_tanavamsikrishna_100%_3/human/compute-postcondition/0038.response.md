Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is:
- `row` remains a list of non-negative integers where the first element `row[0]` is 1, and the elements from `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2. The last element `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is still greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is still `d + 6`.
- `min_heap` still contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed. The tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- `e` is still the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition.
- The value of `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
