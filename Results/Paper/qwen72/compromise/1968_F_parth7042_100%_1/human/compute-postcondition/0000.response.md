The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer, and for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers, and `a` is a list of integers. However, the code snippet only affects the `data` variable and does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings.**
