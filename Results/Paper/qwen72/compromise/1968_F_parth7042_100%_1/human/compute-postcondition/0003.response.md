Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings. `index` is 1.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
