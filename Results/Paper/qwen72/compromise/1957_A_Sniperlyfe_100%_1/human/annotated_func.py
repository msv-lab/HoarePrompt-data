#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each inner list contains integers where the first integer is the number of sticks n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the subsequent integers are the stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The `freq` dictionary will contain the frequency of each list (test case) in `arr`, where the keys are the lists and the values are the counts of how many times each list appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. This means for each list in `arr`, the program calculates how many times the list appears in `arr` (the value in `freq`), divides this count by 3 using integer division, and then sums up all these results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list represents a test case with the number of sticks and their lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique test case by 3. After the function concludes, the input list `arr` remains unchanged, and the function provides a single integer value representing the total number of complete groups of three identical test cases found in `arr`.
