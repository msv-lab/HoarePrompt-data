You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each inner list contains integers where the first integer is the number of sticks n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the subsequent integers are the stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The `freq` dictionary will contain the frequency of each list (test case) in `arr`, where the keys are the lists and the values are the counts of how many times each list appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. This means for each list in `arr`, the program calculates how many times the list appears in `arr` (the value in `freq`), divides this count by 3 using integer division, and then sums up all these results.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of polygons with more than 3 sides. The function `func_1` only considers polygons with 3 sides (triangles) by using `v // 3` to count the number of polygons. However, the problem description states that polygons can have any number of sides, and the maximum number of regular polygons should be determined. For example, in the test case where the input is `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`, the program will output `1` (considering only triangles), but the correct output should be `1` for a square (4 sides) and not a triangle. Similarly, in the test case `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`, the program will output `3` (considering only triangles), but the correct output should be `2` (one pentagon and one square). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
