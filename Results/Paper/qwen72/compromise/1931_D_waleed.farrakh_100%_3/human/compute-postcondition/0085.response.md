Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is already in `freq`, then the value associated with `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with the value 1. `count` remains 0, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.**
