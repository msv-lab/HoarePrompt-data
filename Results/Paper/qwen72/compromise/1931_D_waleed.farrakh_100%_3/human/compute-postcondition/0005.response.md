The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer value of the first line of `data`, and `idx` is 1. For the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1**
