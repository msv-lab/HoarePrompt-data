Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 and `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and `count` remains unchanged.***
