Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
   - `result` is the second element in the list `results`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the variable `result`.
   - According to the initial state, `result` is the second element in the list `results`.
   - Since `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` will be the value of the second element in this list.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of the second element in the list `results`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the list `results`)**
