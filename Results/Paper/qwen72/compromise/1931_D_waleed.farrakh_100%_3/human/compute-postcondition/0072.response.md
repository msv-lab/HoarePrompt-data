Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq`. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged. The variable `count` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that `count` starts at 0. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the additional information that `freq` is an empty dictionary and `count` is 0.
