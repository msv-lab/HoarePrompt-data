Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq[current_pair]` is now 1, and `count` remains unchanged.**
