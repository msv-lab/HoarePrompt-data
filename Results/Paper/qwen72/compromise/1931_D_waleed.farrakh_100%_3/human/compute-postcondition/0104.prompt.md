Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is already in `freq`, then the value associated with `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with the value 1. `count` remains 0, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)` where `a` is the second element of `arr`) is in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1. In both cases, `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`, where `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
