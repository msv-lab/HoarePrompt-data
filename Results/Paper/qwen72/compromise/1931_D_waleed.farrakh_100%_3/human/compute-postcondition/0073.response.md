Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.**

The code snippet `count = 0` reassigns the variable `count` to 0. Since `count` was already 0 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
