Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index 4 of `data`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` updates the value of `arr` to be a list of integers from the line at index 4 of `data` (since `idx` is 3 and `idx + 1` is 4). The other variables remain unchanged.
