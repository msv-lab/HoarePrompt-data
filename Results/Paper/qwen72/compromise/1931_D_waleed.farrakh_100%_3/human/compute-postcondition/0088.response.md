Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` remains 0, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ry = a % y` updates the value of `ry` to be the result of the expression `a % y`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- `a` is the second element of `arr`, and `y` is the third element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `ry` is now the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
