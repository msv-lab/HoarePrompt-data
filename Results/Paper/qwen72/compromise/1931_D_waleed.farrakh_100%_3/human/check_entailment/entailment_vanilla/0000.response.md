### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list.

2. **Processing Test Cases (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x` and adjusted to be non-negative.
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Output (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic for determining if a pair is beautiful is correct. The conditions `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` are checked using the remainders `rx` and `ry`.
  - The use of a dictionary to count the frequency of pairs is efficient and correct.
  - The calculation of `rx` and `ry` ensures that the conditions are met for each pair.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The input parsing is correct and follows the specified format.
  - It correctly appends the test cases to the `test_cases` list and passes them to `func_1`.
  - It prints the results for each test case as required.

The given program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
