Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program provided in `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and checks if the current element can form a beautiful pair with any previously seen elements based on the conditions given in the problem description. The logic in `func_1` ensures that it correctly handles all edge cases, including the constraints on the input size and the values of `x` and `y`. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes it, calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the results. Since the program meets all the requirements and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
