The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. It processes each tuple to count the number of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` in the list `arr` that have previously occurred. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of such occurrences for the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the final state of the program includes the `results` list containing these counts.
