Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the output produced. **
