You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    1 3 5 5 2

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the output produced.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation affects three consecutive elements of the array.
   - The total decrement for the three elements is 4 (1 + 2 + 1).
   - The operation can be applied any number of times, and any index \( i \) can be used multiple times.

3. **Constraints and Conditions**:
   - The sum of the elements in the array must be a multiple of 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero.
   - The first and last elements of the array must be even if they are non-zero, because the only way to decrement them is by the operation affecting the elements around them, and the operation always decrements by 1.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( b \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If the first element \( b[0] \) is odd and the second element \( b[1] \) is not equal to \( b[0] + 2 \), it prints 'NO'.
     - If the last element \( b[-1] \) is odd and the second-to-last element \( b[-2] \) is not equal to \( b[-1] + 2 \), it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The program only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions, but it does not consider the sum of the elements or the overall feasibility of making all elements zero.
   - The conditions \( b[0] \) and \( b[-1] \) being odd and not matching the specific values \( b[1] \) and \( b[-2] \) are not sufficient to determine the correctness of the entire array.
   - The program does not check if the sum of the array is a multiple of 4, which is a crucial condition for the possibility of making all elements zero.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem requirements. It only checks a few specific conditions and does not consider the overall sum of the array or the feasibility of the operations across the entire array.
