The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `a` and returns a new list `a_new`. The first element of `a_new` is the smallest unique element from `a`, and each subsequent element at index `i` (for `i > 0`) is the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in the sorted list of unique elements of `a`. The original list `a` remains unchanged.
