Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    a = func_1(a)
    n = len(a)
    if func_2(a, n) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `a` and returns a new list `a_new`. The first element of `a_new` is the smallest unique element from `a`, and each subsequent element at index `i` (for `i > 0`) is the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in the sorted list of unique elements of `a`. The original list `a` remains unchanged.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `n` where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions: If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is 2, it returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise it returns 2. For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. If the result of the recursive call is 2, or if the result is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.
