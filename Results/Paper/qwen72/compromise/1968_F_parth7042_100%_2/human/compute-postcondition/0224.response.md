Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations, `index` is `3 * t + 2 * (sum of all `n` values) + 2 * (sum of all `q` values)`, `results` is a list of length `sum of all `q` values` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each query iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations, meaning that all test cases have been processed.
- The `index` variable has been incremented by `3 * t + 2 * (sum of all `n` values) + 2 * (sum of all `q` values)`. This is because for each test case:
  - `index` is incremented by 2 to read `n` and `q`.
  - `index` is then incremented by `n` to read the list `a`.
  - `index` is further incremented by `2 * q` to read the `q` queries.
- The `results` list contains a total of `sum of all `q` values` elements, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. These elements are the results of the queries processed for each test case, based on the conditions checked within the loop.
