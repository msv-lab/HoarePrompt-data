Output State: **`results` contains the string 'YES' appended to its previous value, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `data`, `index`, `test_cases`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) are not affected by this operation and retain their previous values.
- The initial state conditions remain valid, with the only change being the addition of 'YES' to the `results` list.
