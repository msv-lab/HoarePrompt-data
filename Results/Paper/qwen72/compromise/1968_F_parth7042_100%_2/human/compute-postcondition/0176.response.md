Output State: **`index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 1`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 1, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1.**
