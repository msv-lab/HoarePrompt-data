Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[2]` is the result of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list in `mp` at the key `pf[2]`.
- `pf[2]` is the result of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`.
- Therefore, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
