Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.***
