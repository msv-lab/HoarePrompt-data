Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is increased by `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`. For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`. `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 1`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 3`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 1, `results` is a list of length `q + 1` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is equal to `q`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`, `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at index `it1` in `v1` is less than the element at index `it2` in `v2`, then the conditions from the if part are met. Otherwise, the conditions from the else part are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 5`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 1, `results` is a list of length `q + 2` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`, `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. `it2` is now `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then the function updates `results` accordingly. Otherwise, the function updates `results` in a different manner.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 7`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 2, `results` is a list of length `q + 4` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`, `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. `it2` is now `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then the function performs some operation (not specified in the given postcondition). Otherwise, the function performs a different operation (also not specified in the given postcondition).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
