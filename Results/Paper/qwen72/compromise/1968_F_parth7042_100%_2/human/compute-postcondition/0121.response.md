Output State: **`q` is greater than 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` now contains the string 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The values of `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results` remain as they were defined in the initial state, with `index` being increased by 2.
- The condition for updating `results` remains unchanged, and the specific values of `it1` and `it2` will be determined by the `bisect_left` function based on the updated value of `l`.
