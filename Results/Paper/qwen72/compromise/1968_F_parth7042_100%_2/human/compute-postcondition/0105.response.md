Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2.** 

The value of `index` is incremented by 2, while the values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, but their references to the `data` list are now based on the updated `index`.
