Output State: **`mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.**

The code initializes `mp` as a defaultdict with `list` as the default factory. This means that `mp` will automatically create a new list for any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
