Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the value 1, `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is now assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a[1]`, `index`, `pf[1]`, and `mp[pf[1]]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
