Output State: **`index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 3`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 1, `results` is a list of length `q + 1` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is equal to `q`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the `continue` statement has been executed, which means the program will skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. None of the variables listed in the initial state have been modified by the `continue` statement, so all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
