Output State: **`index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 7`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 2, `results` is a list of length `q + 3` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`, `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. `it2` is now `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The `index` is still increased by `2 * q + n + 7`, `mp` is still a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` still contains the list `[0, 1]`, and for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` still contains the list `[i]`. The value of `q` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 2. The list `results` is still of length `q + 3` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO'. The variable `_` is still 2, and `t` must still be greater than `q + 1`. The value of `n` is still the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1. The list `a` is still of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`. The list `pf` is still of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`. The value of `l` is still the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, and `r` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `x` is still the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. The list `v1` is still `mp[pf[r]]`, and the list `v2` is still `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. The value of `it1` is still the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`, and `it2` is still the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`, which is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
