### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Separation:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - This is done correctly using the `isdigit()` method to check if a character is a digit.

3. **Sorting and Validation:**
   - The program sorts the `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each digit with the next one in the list.
   - The program also checks if any digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list. This is to ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

4. **Password Reconstruction and Comparison:**
   - The program reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then compares the reconstructed password with the original password to check if the original password was already sorted in the required manner.

### Issues Identified:
- **Digit and Letter Comparison:**
  - The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It should be checking if any digit comes after any letter in the original password, not just the last digit.
  - The correct condition should be to ensure that all digits are before all letters, which can be done by checking if the last letter (if any) is before the first digit (if any).

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison `if (sortedPassword == password):` is correct. It ensures that the password meets the sorting conditions.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Ensure digits and letters are sorted
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if digits are in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):
        if digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if letters are in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(letters) - 1):
        if letters[i] > letters[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if all digits are before all letters
    if letters and digits and letters[0] < digits[-1]:
        return False
    
    # Reconstruct the password and compare with the original
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

### Correctness:
- The original function has a logical error in the digit and letter comparison.
- The corrected function ensures that all conditions are met correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
