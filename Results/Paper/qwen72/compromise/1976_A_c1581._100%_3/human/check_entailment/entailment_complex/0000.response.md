Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each case by reading the length of the password and the password itself. This matches the problem description.

2. **Character Classification**: The `func_1` function correctly separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is necessary to check the sorting conditions for each type of character separately.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program sorts the `digits` and `letters` lists. This is a good approach to check if the characters are in non-decreasing order.
   - The first loop checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If any digit is greater than the next digit, it returns `False`.

4. **Digit After Letter Check**:
   - The second loop checks if any digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list. This is intended to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. However, this check is flawed because it only compares the last digit with the first letter, and it should compare each digit with each letter to ensure no digit comes after any letter.

5. **Final Check**:
   - The program combines the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and checks if the resulting string matches the original password. This is a good approach to ensure that the password is already sorted in the required order.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the password consists of only digits or only letters correctly, as these should be considered strong passwords if they are sorted.

However, the **Digit After Letter Check** is incorrect. The correct approach should be to check the order of characters as they appear in the original password, not just comparing the last digit with the first letter. The correct way to do this is to iterate through the password and ensure that no digit follows a letter.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if any digit comes after a letter
    has_letter = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit() and has_letter:
            return False
        if char.isalpha():
            has_letter = True
    
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:
- **Sorting Check**: The program now directly checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are already sorted using the `sorted` function.
- **Digit After Letter Check**: The program iterates through the password and sets a flag `has_letter` to `True` when it encounters a letter. If it encounters a digit after a letter, it returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is **incorrect** due to the flawed digit after letter check. The corrected function addresses this issue and should work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
