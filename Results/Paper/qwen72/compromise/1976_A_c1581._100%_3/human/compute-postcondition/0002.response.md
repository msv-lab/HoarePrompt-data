The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters. For the loop to execute, the `password` must have at least 1 character, and `char` will be the first character of the `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of the `password`**
