You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided, where each string consists of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: The value of `l` will be 'NO' after the loop executes all iterations, assuming the loop completes without any interruptions. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is designed to be called within a context where multiple test cases are processed. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a value based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
