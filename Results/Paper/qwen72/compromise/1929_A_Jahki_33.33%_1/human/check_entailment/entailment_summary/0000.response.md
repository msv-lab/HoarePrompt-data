### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array in ascending order because the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.
   - It checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the function `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in strictly increasing order, it prints `0` (this is incorrect, as the beauty is not necessarily zero in such cases).
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly used to determine if the array is already in strictly increasing order. The problem does not require checking if the array is already sorted; it requires maximizing the beauty, which is always achieved by sorting the array.
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty, regardless of the initial order of the array.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, sort the array `a`.
   - Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - Print the calculated beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it unnecessarily checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order and prints `0` in such cases, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
