Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is `num2 - 1`. `order` is the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list, considering the first `num2 - 1` elements. The value of `order` is 0, indicating that the first `num2 - 1` elements of `a` are strictly increasing.**
