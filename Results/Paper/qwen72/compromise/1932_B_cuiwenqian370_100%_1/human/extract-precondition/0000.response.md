Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
```

This definition aligns with the problem's requirements, where `n` is the number of signs and `a` is the list of periodicities.
