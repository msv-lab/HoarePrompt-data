### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input, especially when the input is large and needs to be processed efficiently.
   - The variable `T` is correctly set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculation of the Next Year:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula is correct for finding the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The formula works as follows:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start looking for the next multiple from `last_year + 1`.
     - `// a[i]` performs integer division, which gives the number of complete cycles of `a[i]` that fit into the current year.
     - `* a[i]` multiplies the result by `a[i]` to get the next multiple of `a[i]`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program appends the calculated `last_year` for each test case to the `results` list as a string.
   - Finally, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line, using `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. If there is only one sign, the program will output `a[0]` as the year when the apocalypse will happen.
   - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly. In this case, the signs will occur in consecutive years, and the program will output `n` as the year when the n-th sign occurs.

5. **Performance:**
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints. It processes each test case in O(n) time, where n is the number of signs. This is acceptable given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles the input and output formats as specified, and works for all potential cases within the given constraints.

### Final:
**True**
