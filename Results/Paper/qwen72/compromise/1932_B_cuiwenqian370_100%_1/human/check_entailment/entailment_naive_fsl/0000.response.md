Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input as specified, processes each test case, and calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The calculation of the next year for each sign is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which correctly finds the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required. The program also handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
