### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - The number of test cases `T` is read from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` is read, followed by a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Sign Calculation:**
   - The variable `last_year` is initialized to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the next year in which the sign will occur is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1\right) // \text{a[i]} \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the `last_year` is appended to the `results` list as a string.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are written to standard output, each on a new line.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula \((\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1) // \text{a[i]} \times \text{a[i]}\) is mathematically sound. It ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
  - This aligns with the problem's requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

- **Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `T` and processing each test case in a loop.
  - The `results` list is used to store the results of each test case, and these results are written to standard output at the end.

- **Input and Output Formats:**
  - The input is read and split correctly, and the output is formatted as specified in the problem description.
  - Each result is a single integer, and each test case's result is on a new line.

### Example Verification:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `last_year = 3`
  - Next year for the second sign: \((3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 \times 2 = 4\)
  - Next year for the third sign: \((4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 \times 4 = 8\)
  - Next year for the fourth sign: \((8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 \times 5 = 10\)
  - Next year for the fifth sign: \((10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 \times 9 = 18\)
  - Next year for the sixth sign: \((18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 \times 18 = 36\)
  - The final year is 36, which matches the expected output.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial `last_year = 1`
  - Next year for the second sign: \((1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 \times 2 = 2\)
  - Next year for the third sign: \((2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 \times 3 = 3\)
  - Next year for the fourth sign: \((3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Next year for the fifth sign: \((4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 \times 5 = 5\)
  - The final year is 5, which matches the expected output.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `last_year = 1`
  - Next year for the second sign: \((1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 \times 1 = 2\)
  - Next year for the third sign: \((2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 \times 1 = 3\)
  - Next year for the fourth sign: \((3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 \times 1 = 4\)
  - Next year for the fifth sign: \((4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 \times 1 = 5\)
  - The final year is 5, which matches the expected output.

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Initial `last_year = 50`
  - Next year for the second sign: \((50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 \times 30 = 80\)
  - Next year for the third sign: \((80 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 \times 711 = 711\)
  - Next year for the fourth sign: \((711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 \times 200 = 800\)
  - Next year for the fifth sign: \((800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 \times 503 = 1006\)
  - Next year for the sixth sign: \((1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 \times 1006 = 2012\)
  - The final year is 2012, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The input and output formats are handled correctly, and the program produces the expected results for the given test cases.

Final: **True**
