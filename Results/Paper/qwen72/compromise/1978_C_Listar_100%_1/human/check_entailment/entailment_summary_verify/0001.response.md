### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - The permutation must contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Function 4 (func_4)**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It correctly checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

3. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function generates the permutation.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to 1 in steps of 2, decrementing `k` by `i - 1` and swapping elements in the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0, it returns the list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to perform a more precise swap.
   - It calls `func_3` to perform a swap and continues the process.

4. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function performs a swap to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `l[-c]` and `l[-c - k]`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

5. **Function 3 (func_3)**:
   - This function performs a swap to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `l[c - 1]` and `l[-c]`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

6. **Function 5 (func_5)**:
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.

7. **Function 6 (func_6)**:
   - This function handles the input and output for each test case.
   - It calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print it.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `k` is odd, the program correctly returns "NO" because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
  - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, the program correctly returns "NO".
  - The program handles the generation of the permutation correctly by using a combination of swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly checks for the validity of `k` and `n`.
  - The permutation generation logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by making appropriate swaps.
  - The output is correctly formatted and handles both cases where a permutation exists and where it does not.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **func_4**:
  - The function correctly identifies invalid cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value.
  - The maximum value calculation is correct for both even and odd `n`.

- **func_1**:
  - The function initializes the permutation correctly.
  - The loop structure and swap logic are designed to reduce `k` step by step.
  - The function correctly handles the case where `k` becomes 0 and returns the permutation.
  - The function calls `func_2` and `func_3` to perform more precise swaps when necessary.

- **func_2 and func_3**:
  - Both functions perform specific swaps to reduce `k` by a calculated amount.
  - The swaps are designed to maintain the permutation property and reduce `k` appropriately.

- **func_5**:
  - The function correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

- **func_6**:
  - The function correctly handles the input and output for each test case.
  - It calls the appropriate functions to check for valid `n` and `k`, generate the permutation, and print the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the required cases as per the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
