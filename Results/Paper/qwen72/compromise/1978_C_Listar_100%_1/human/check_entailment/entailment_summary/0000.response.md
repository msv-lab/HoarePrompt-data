### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation (`func_4`)**:
   - `func_4` reads `n` and `k` from input and performs initial validation.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because it is impossible to achieve a higher Manhattan value.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over the range from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, incrementing a counter `c` at each step.
   - If `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, it returns the list `l` as the permutation.
   - If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to swap elements and return the modified list.
   - Otherwise, it updates `k` and modifies `l` using `func_3`.
   - The function ensures that the permutation is generated such that the Manhattan value is equal to `k`.

3. **Element Swapping (`func_2` and `func_3`)**:
   - `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - These functions are used to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Output Handling (`func_5`)**:
   - `func_5` prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces.
   - It is called by `func_6` to output the generated permutation.

5. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - `func_6` calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Validation in `func_4`**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is odd or too large.
  - It ensures that the input is valid before proceeding to generate the permutation.

- **Permutation Generation in `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
  - It iterates over the list and uses `func_2` and `func_3` to swap elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
  - The logic for updating `k` and modifying the list `l` is consistent with the problem requirements.

- **Element Swapping in `func_2` and `func_3`**:
  - These functions correctly swap the specified elements in the list `l`.
  - They ensure that the permutation remains valid (i.e., all elements are distinct and within the range [1, n]).

- **Output in `func_5`**:
  - The function correctly prints the result in the required format.

- **Overall Flow in `func_6`**:
  - The function correctly handles the input and output flow.
  - It ensures that the permutation is generated and printed only if it is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to handle the problem correctly by validating the input, generating the permutation, and printing the result in the required format. All functions work together to meet the problem description.
