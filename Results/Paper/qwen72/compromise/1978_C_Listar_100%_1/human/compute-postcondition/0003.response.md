Output State: **The program returns `None`.** 

In this case, the return statement is empty, which means the function returns `None` by default. Since the initial state indicates that `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, and the current value of `n` is 0, the function does not modify or return any specific values for `n` or `k`. The program simply returns `None`.
