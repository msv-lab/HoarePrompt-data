The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves two non-negative integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_5` with the result of `func_1`. The function does not return any value in this case.
