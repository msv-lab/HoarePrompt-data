Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (i.e., a dictionary with keys that are common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` and values that are the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` for those keys), `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `aa[:m]` that are not in `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user with length greater than `m`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `aa[:m]` that are not in `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`, `fnd` is 2 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user with length greater than `m`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 3 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 2, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `aa[:m]` that are not in `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, the length of `aa[m:]` must be greater than 0, the length of `aa[:n - m]` must be greater than 0, `tot` is updated to the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user with length greater than `m`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 4 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 3, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `aa[:m]` that are not in `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, the length of `aa[m:]` must be greater than 0, the length of `aa[:n - m]` must be greater than 0, `tot` is updated to the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
