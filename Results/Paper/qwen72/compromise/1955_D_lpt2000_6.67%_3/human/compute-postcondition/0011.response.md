Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with the minimum frequency for each element, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their frequencies, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
