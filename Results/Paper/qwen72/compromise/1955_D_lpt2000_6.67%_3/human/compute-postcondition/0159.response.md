Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`.** 

The initial conditions remain unchanged, and `tot` is now the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`.
