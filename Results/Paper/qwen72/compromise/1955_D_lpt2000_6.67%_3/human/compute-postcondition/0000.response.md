The code snippet `nabors = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `nabors`. This means `nabors` will hold an integer value that is provided as input. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take three parameters: n, m, and k, where n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, a and b, where a has n elements and b has m elements, and each element in a and b is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. `nabors` is an input integer.**
