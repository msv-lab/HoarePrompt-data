Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with the minimum frequency for each element, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their frequencies, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`. If `tot >= k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The states of `C`, `D`, and `E` are not affected.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`. If `tot >= k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
