Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: n, m, and k, where n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, a and b, where a has n elements and b has m elements, and each element in a and b is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:
```
def count_good_subsegments(t, test_cases):
```
Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described in the problem. 

Given the original function definition:
```
def func():
```
It does not accept any parameters, which is not suitable for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the precondition cannot be accurately stated based on this function definition. 

If you intended to provide a more specific function definition, please update it accordingly.
