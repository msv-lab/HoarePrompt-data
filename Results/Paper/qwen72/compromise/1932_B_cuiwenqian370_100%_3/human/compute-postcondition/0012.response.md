The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, n)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
