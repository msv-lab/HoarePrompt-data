To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

The variables and conditions in the loop head are:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will iterate from 1 to `n-1`.
- `n`: This is the upper bound of the loop, and the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`.
- `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `T` must be greater than `_`.
- `index` is incremented by `n`.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, n)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The initial state specifies `i` as `n-1`, which is not correct for the loop to start. We need to adjust `i` to start at 1.
2. **`n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The initial state does not specify this condition, so we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be 1 for the loop to start.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables and conditions (`a`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, `_`, `T`, and `index`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**
