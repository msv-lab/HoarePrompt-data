The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

After the increment:
- `i` will be 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**
