Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `index` is incremented by `n + 1`, so the new value of `index` is `index + n + 1`.
- The other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, `_`, `T`) remain unchanged in their values or conditions.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`. After `index` is incremented by `n + 1`, the new starting point for `a` is `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`.
- The value of `n` is still the integer value of `data[index - n]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The expressions for `last_year` and `next_year` remain the same.
- The condition that `T` must be greater than `_ + 1` still holds.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
