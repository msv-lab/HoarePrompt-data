Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`**

The value of `last_year` is updated to be the same as the value of `next_year`. Both `last_year` and `next_year` are now equal to the expression `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
