The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). The variable `i` is already set to `n-1` before the loop starts, but this is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is now equal to `a[0]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`**
