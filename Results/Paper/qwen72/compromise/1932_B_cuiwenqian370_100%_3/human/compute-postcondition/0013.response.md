Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is calculated using the expression `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
- The specific value of `next_year` depends on the values of `last_year` and `a[1]`, which are not provided, so it is expressed in terms of these variables.
