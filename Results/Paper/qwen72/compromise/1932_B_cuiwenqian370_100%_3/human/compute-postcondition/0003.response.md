Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 0, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`.** 

The value of `T` is now set to the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
