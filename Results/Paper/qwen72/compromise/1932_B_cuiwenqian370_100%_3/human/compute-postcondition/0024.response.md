Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`**

Explanation:
- `n` is now assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `i` remains `n-1` as it is derived from the new value of `n`.
- `last_year` and `next_year` remain unchanged, still equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`.
- `results` still includes the string representation of `last_year`.
- `_` remains incremented by 1.
- `T` must still be greater than `_`.
