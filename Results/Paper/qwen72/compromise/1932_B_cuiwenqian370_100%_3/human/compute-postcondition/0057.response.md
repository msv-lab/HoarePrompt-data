Output State: **The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]` from the last iteration, `a` is the list of `n` integers from the last iteration, `last_year` is the final computed value for the last iteration, `next_year` is the same as `last_year` from the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the string representations of the final `last_year` values from each of the `T` iterations, `index` is `1 + T + sum(n for each iteration)`, and `_` is `T - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has finished running `T` times.
- The variable `n` holds the value of the last `n` processed in the loop.
- The list `a` contains the last set of integers processed in the loop.
- `last_year` is the final year value computed in the last iteration of the loop.
- `next_year` is the same as `last_year` from the last iteration.
- `results` is a list that contains the string representation of the final `last_year` value from each of the `T` iterations.
- `index` has been incremented to the position after all the data used in the `T` iterations.
- The loop variable `_` is `T - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `T` times.
