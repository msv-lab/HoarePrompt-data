Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be made sorted by splitting elements is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

The program produces the correct output for the given test cases, but it fails in more complex scenarios. Consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

However, consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
12 28 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The issue arises when the array has multiple elements that need to be split to achieve a sorted order. For example:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

The program checks only the immediate previous element and splits it if necessary. However, it does not consider the possibility that the split might affect the subsequent elements. For instance, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. This approach is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that further splits might be required to achieve a fully sorted array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should recursively or iteratively split elements and recheck the entire array to ensure it can be made sorted. The current implementation does not handle this complexity, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
