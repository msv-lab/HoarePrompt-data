Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the `nums` list remained sorted throughout all iterations.**

Explanation: The code snippet `m = int(input())` updates the value of `m` to an integer input by the user, which must satisfy the condition `m >= 2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged, retaining their initial states.
