To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (`1`). This means `m - 1 >= 1`, which simplifies to `m >= 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m`**: Since `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure this condition is met.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` will be set to `m - 1` at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an input integer greater than 1
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True

We need to adjust `m` to ensure it is at least 2 and set `i` to `m - 1` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True**
