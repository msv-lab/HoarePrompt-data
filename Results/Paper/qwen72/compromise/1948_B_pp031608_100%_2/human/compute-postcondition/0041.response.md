The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to the first element of the list `nums`. Let's break down the impact:

- `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- The value of `nums[0]` is the first digit of the integer `arr[i - 1]` before the update.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `i`, `arr`, `nums`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
