Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The list `nums` is not sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
