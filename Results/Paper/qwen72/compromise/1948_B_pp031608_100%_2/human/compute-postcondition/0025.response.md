Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than the new value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.***
