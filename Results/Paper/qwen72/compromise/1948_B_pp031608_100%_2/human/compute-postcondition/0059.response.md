To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 2\).
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the logic).
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `ans` is a boolean variable that starts as `True`.

### Loop Logic:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1.
- For each iteration, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
- If this condition is true and the `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop terminates early.
- If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, `ans` remains `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement uses a list with two elements: `'NO'` and `'YES'`.
- The index of the list is determined by the value of `ans`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the index is 1, and the output will be `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, the index is 0, and the output will be `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
- If the list `arr` remains sorted throughout all iterations, `ans` will be `True`, and the output will be `'YES'`.
- If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` will be `False`, and the output will be `'NO'`.

Output: **'YES' (if the list `arr` remains sorted throughout all iterations) or 'NO' (if at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the `nums` list is not sorted)**
