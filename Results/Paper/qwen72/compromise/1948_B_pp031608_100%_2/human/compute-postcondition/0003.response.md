The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. The list `arr` is populated with these integers.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `_` remains a placeholder.
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
