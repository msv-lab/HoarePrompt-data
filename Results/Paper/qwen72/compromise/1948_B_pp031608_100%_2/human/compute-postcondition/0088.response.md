To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n-1 \leq 50\), which implies \(2 \leq n \leq 51\).
- `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 2\).
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the logic).
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `ans` is a boolean value that starts as `True` and can be set to `False` if certain conditions are met during the loop execution.

### Logic:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 (i.e., `i = 1`).
- For each iteration, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
- If this condition is true, it performs further checks:
  - It creates a new list `nums` by removing the element at index `i` from `arr`.
  - It checks if the resulting `nums` list is sorted.
  - If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`.
- If any iteration sets `ans` to `False`, the final value of `ans` will be `False`.
- If no iteration sets `ans` to `False`, the final value of `ans` will remain `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement uses a list with two elements: `'NO'` and `'YES'`.
- The index `[ans]` is used to select the appropriate string to print.
- If `ans` is `True`, the index will be 1, and `'YES'` will be printed.
- If `ans` is `False`, the index will be 0, and `'NO'` will be printed.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the output will be:
- **'YES'** if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by removing at most one element.
- **'NO'** if the list `arr` cannot be made non-decreasing by removing at most one element.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is True if the list arr can be made non-decreasing by removing at most one element, and False otherwise)**
