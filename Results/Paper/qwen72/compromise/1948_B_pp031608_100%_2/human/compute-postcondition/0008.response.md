Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`, and the list `nums` is not sorted.**
