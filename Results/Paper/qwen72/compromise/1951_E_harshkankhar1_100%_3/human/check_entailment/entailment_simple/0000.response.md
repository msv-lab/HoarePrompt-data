### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindromic String:**
   - The program starts by checking if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself, as the entire string is already a valid partition.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program then searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from `1` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `s`), and sets `x` to the index of the first non-matching character.

3. **Handling All Characters Being the Same:**
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `x` remains `-1`), the program prints "NO" because no valid partition can be made.

4. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If a non-matching character is found (`x` is not `-1`), the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program further checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`.
     - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the only possible partitions would include a palindrome.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1: Entire String is Non-Palindromic:**
  - If `s` is not a palindrome, the program correctly prints "YES", `1`, and `s` itself. This is a valid partition.

- **Case 2: All Characters are the Same:**
  - If all characters in `s` are the same, the program correctly prints "NO" because no valid partition can be made.

- **Case 3: First Non-Matching Character Found:**
  - If a non-matching character is found at index `x`, the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` is valid.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`.
    - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it correctly prints "NO" because the only possible partitions would include a palindrome.
    - If `x` is neither `1` nor `n // 2`, the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the string is partitioned into non-palindromic substrings or correctly identifies when no such partition is possible.

### Correctness: **True**
