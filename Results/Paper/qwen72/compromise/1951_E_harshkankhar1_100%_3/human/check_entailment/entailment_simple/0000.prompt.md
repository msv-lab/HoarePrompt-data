ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Program:

    #State: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is -1, and `s` is a string provided by the user with a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. Additionally, `func_1(s[0:])` is true.

        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return

    #State: `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, and the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')

        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: - Since `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first such character.
        #   - `s[:x + 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
        #   - `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters from the first character that is different from `s[0]` to the end of the string.
        #
        #Given the precondition, the output will be the first part of the string up to and including the first different character, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string.

If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, and the else part is executed.
    #State: *`s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, and the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, the else part is executed, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the if part is executed. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, the else part is executed.
