Let's break down the precondition and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Precondition Analysis:
1. **`s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`**:
   - This means that the string `s` has at least one character that is not the same as the first character of the string.

2. **`x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.

3. **The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` itself does not change.

4. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of the string, and it returns `True`.

5. **`x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`**:
   - `x` is not the second character (index 1) and `x` is not the middle character (index `n // 2`).

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```
print('YES')
```
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
Given the precondition, the code snippet will always print `'YES'` because the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the precondition. The `print` statement is a simple output of the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
