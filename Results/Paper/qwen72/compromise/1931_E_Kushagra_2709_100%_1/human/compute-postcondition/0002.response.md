The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num`. For the loop to execute, the range function must generate a sequence of valid indices. This depends on the length of `num`.

- The loop starts with `i` set to `len(num) - 1`.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(num)` must be at least 1.

Given that `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `num` will always have at least 1 character. Therefore, `len(num)` will always be at least 1, and the loop will always execute at least once.

However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of the loop.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
