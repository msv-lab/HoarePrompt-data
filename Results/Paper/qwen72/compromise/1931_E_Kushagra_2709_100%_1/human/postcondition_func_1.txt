The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 1,000,000,000 (inclusive) and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, the input variable `num` remains unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the count of trailing zeros.
