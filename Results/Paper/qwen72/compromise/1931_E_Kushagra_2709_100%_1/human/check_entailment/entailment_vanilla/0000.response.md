### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a single integer on her turn.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list on his turn.
   - The game ends when there is only one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is not less than \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The length of the final integer is crucial. If the final integer has at least \(m + 1\) digits, Sasha wins.
   - Anna's move (reversing digits) does not change the number of digits in the integer.
   - Sasha's move (concatenating two integers) increases the total number of digits in the list by the number of digits in the two integers combined, minus the number of digits in the resulting concatenated integer.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer.
   - It is used to determine how many digits can be removed from the total count when Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The function is correct because it iterates from the end of the string representation of the number and counts zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers.
   - It then sorts the list of trailing zero counts in descending order.
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, subtracting the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count.
   - The idea is that Sasha can always choose the two integers with the most trailing zeros to concatenate, thus minimizing the increase in the total number of digits.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts trailing zeros.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - The sorting and subtraction logic in `func_1` ensures that Sasha's optimal strategy is considered.
   - The final check `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines the winner based on the total number of digits.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct in determining the winner of the game based on the optimal play of both players.

Correctness: **True**
