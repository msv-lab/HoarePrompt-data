### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who manipulate a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is exactly one integer left in the list, and Sasha wins if this integer is not less than \(10^m\).

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
   - It correctly iterates from the end of the string representation of the number and counts zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros, which is used to determine the optimal moves in the game.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers.
   - It then sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - The function subtracts the counts of trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits.
   - Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The key to determining the winner is understanding the impact of trailing zeros on the total number of digits.
   - Trailing zeros can be removed by reversing the number, which reduces the total number of digits.
   - Sasha's strategy involves concatenating numbers to maximize the total number of digits.
   - By subtracting the counts of trailing zeros at even indices, the function effectively simulates the optimal play where Anna removes the most significant trailing zeros.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly: \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - The input is assumed to be valid, and the functions handle the valid inputs as described.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples are consistent with the logic of the functions.
   - For instance, in the first test case, the total number of digits is 3 (14 has 2 digits, 2 has 1 digit). After Anna's move, the total number of digits is still 3, and Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Thus, Sasha wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The functions handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the examples provided are consistent with the expected outcomes.

**Correctness: True**
