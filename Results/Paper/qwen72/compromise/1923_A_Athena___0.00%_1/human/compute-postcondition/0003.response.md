The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or similar construct that handles multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) where `a_i = 0` indicates a free cell and `a_i = 1` indicates a cell containing a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the minimum number of moves required to move all chips to a single cell, where each move consists of moving a chip from one cell to an adjacent cell.**
