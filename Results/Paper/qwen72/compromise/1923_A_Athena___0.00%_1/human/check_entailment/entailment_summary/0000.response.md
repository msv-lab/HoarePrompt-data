### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of cell states.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The function removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop: `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop: `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon with chips and no leading or trailing free cells.

3. **Counting Zeros**:
   - After removing the leading and trailing zeros, the function counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` using a for loop: `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1`.
   - The variable `res` is intended to represent the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the modified list `a` and the count `res` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The goal is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
  - By removing leading and trailing zeros, the function effectively focuses on the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips.
  - The number of zeros remaining in this segment represents the number of free cells between the chips.
  - Each zero in this segment represents a free cell that needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right to the left.
  - Therefore, the count of zeros `res` is indeed the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

### Issues:

- **Print Statements**:
  - The function prints the modified list `a` and the result `res` for each test case. However, the problem description only requires printing the result `res`.
  - The print statement `print(a)` is unnecessary and should be removed to match the problem's output format.

### Conclusion:

The algorithm is correct in terms of logic and achieving the desired result. However, the unnecessary print statement `print(a)` should be removed to ensure the output format matches the problem description.

### Correctness:

**Correctness: False**

### Suggested Fix:

Remove the line `print(a)` from the function to ensure the output format is correct.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)
```
