The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles in the game. `piles` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each `a_i` represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns the result of the game for each test case, which is not specified in the provided output but can be inferred to be some form of game outcome based on the piles of stones.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of piles, and `piles` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function returns the result of the game based on the piles of stones.**
