Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `piles` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `ls`, which is now assigned the value 0.
