Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the game's rules accurately. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` simply returns `a - 1` if `a <= b` and `b` otherwise. This does not reflect the game's rules where players are removed based on the positions specified in the sequence `a`.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The game involves removing players at specific positions in each round until no more players can be removed. The provided function does not simulate this process. It does not handle the dynamic nature of the game where the number of players changes after each round.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the example given in the problem description with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`. The correct output should be `2` because players C and E are removed in the first round, and player D is removed in the second round, leaving players A and B as winners.
   - However, the function `func_1(3, 5)` returns `2`, which is incorrect because it does not simulate the game's rounds and removals.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
