Output State: **`S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` at index `i` (0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) represents the number of '0's and '1's, respectively, in the string `a` from the start up to the `i-1`-th character. The last sublist in `S` will be `[count of '0's in a, count of '1's in a]` and the first sublist will remain `[0, 0]`. `ans` is 0.**
