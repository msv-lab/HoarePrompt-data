Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the optimal position to build a road in the village of Letovo based on the preferences of the residents. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: An integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.
   - **Output**: The index `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) where the road should be built to satisfy the conditions.
   - **Logic**:
     - It first reads the input values `n` and `a`.
     - It then creates a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the number of '0's and '1's up to the `i-1`-th character in `a`.
     - It iterates through each possible position `i` to place the road and checks if the conditions are satisfied:
       - The number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total characters on the left side.
       - The number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total characters on the right side.
     - It keeps track of the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the conditions.
     - Finally, it prints the optimal position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: None.
   - **Output**: None.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array `S` is correctly constructed to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`.
- **Condition Checking**: The conditions for the left and right sides are correctly implemented using the prefix sum array. The program checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total characters on the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total characters on the right side.
- **Optimal Position**: The program correctly finds the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the conditions. It uses the `abs` function to measure the distance from `n / 2` and updates `ans` accordingly.
- **Test Cases Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and constraints as specified.

Correctness: **True**
