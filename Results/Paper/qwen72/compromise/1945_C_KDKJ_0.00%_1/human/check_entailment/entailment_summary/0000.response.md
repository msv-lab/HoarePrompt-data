### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find a position `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) to place a road such that:
     - On the left side (from the start up to the `i-1`-th house), at least half of the residents want to live on the left side.
     - On the right side (from the `i`-th house to the end), at least half of the residents want to live on the right side.
   - The position `i` should be as close to the middle of the village as possible. If there are multiple such positions, the smallest one should be chosen.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.
   - **Prefix Sums**: It calculates prefix sums for the number of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains two values: the number of '0's and the number of '1's up to the `i-1`-th character.
   - **Condition Check**: For each possible position `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n), it checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side.
   - **Optimal Position**: It keeps track of the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the conditions. If multiple positions satisfy the conditions and are equally close to `n / 2`, it chooses the smaller one.
   - **Output**: It prints the optimal position `i`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Prefix Sums Calculation**: The prefix sums are correctly calculated and stored in `S`.
   - **Condition Check**: The conditions for the number of '0's and '1's on each side are correctly checked.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: The function correctly selects the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the conditions.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
