Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, compute `A` and `B` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` respectively, and print the sum `A + B`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` will be unchanged, but the loop will have printed the sum `A + B` for each test case.**
