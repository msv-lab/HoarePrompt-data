The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`, and an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of `a`, `b`, and `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^18, and `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The function processes these parameters for each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
