Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The function handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, which are integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) is true, which means \(k\) is less than \(n - k + 2\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\):**
   - Simplify the inequality: \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\)
   - Add \(k\) to both sides: \(2k - 1 < n + 1\)
   - Add 1 to both sides: \(2k < n + 2\)
   - Divide both sides by 2: \(k < \frac{n + 2}{2}\)
   - This means \(k\) is less than half of \(n + 2\).

2. **Values of `n` and `k`:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - \(k\) is less than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\).

3. **Expression `n - k + 1`:**
   - Since \(k\) is less than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\), \(n - k + 1\) will always be a positive integer.
   - The value of `n - k + 1` is the result of subtracting `k` from `n` and then adding 1.

4. **Output of the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will output two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `n - k + 1` is a positive integer based on the given conditions.
   - The second value is explicitly `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer calculated as n - k + 1 and 1 is the explicit value)**
