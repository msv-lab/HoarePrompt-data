Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, with `n` not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then `k` is less than `n - k + 2`. Otherwise, `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.**
