Based on the initial state provided:

- The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- The function handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, which are integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is true, which simplifies to `k < n - k + 2`.

Given the condition `k < n - k + 2`, we can simplify it further:
\[ k - 1 < n - k + 1 \]
\[ k - 1 < n - k + 1 \]
\[ k + k - 1 < n + 1 \]
\[ 2k - 1 < n + 1 \]
\[ 2k < n + 2 \]
\[ k < \frac{n + 2}{2} \]

This condition is true, meaning that `k` is indeed less than `n - k + 2`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Since the condition `k < n - k + 2` is true, the `print` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
