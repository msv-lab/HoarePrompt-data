Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is false, which means `(k - 1 >= n - k + 1)`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k` because the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is explicitly stated to be false.

Output: **NO**
