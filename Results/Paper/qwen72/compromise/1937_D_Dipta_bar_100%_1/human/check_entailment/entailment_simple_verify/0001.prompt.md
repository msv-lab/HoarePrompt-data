You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n`.
   - Each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each placing a pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the length `n` and the string `s` of length `n`.
   - The output should be `n` integers, each representing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the corresponding cell.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed by iterating from left to right and keeping track of the positions of '>' characters.
   - `B` is computed by iterating from right to left and keeping track of the positions of '<' characters.
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the precomputed values from `A` and `B`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Precompute `A`:**
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the current character is '>', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '>' character and add it to the `A` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '>' characters in `idx_A`.

   - **Precompute `B`:**
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the current character is '<', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '<' character and add it to the `B` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '<' characters in `idx_B`.

   - **Answer Queries:**
     - For each cell, determine the direction of the pinball.
     - Use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve combining the steps from `A` and `B` and adjusting for the current position and the number of steps required to invert the characters.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the precomputation of `A` and `B`.
   - The logic for calculating the time for each cell is complex but follows the rules of the problem.
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the grid.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The precomputation steps for `A` and `B` are both O(n).
   - The query answering step is also O(n).
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The precomputation and query answering steps are well thought out and handle the problem constraints effectively.
