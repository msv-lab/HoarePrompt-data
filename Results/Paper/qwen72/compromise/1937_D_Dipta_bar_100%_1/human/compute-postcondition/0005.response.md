Output State: **`A` is a list of integers where each element represents the cumulative count of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to the current index, adjusted by the distance between consecutive '>' characters and the number of '>' characters seen so far. `idx_A` is a list of indices where each element is the index of a '>' character in the string `s`. `B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `B`. The values of `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
