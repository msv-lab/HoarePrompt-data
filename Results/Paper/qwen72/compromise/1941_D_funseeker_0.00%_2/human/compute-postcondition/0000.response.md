Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are now the values returned by `func_3()`.** 

Natural language description: The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` have been updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The previous constraints on `n`, `m`, and `x` (2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n) are no longer guaranteed to hold after the execution of this code, as the function `func_3()` could return any values for these variables.
