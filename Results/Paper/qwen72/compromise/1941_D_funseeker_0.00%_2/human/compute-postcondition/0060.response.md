Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least two elements, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the second element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and the new value `(q + r) % n` is added to the set, which means `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '0', `temp` initially contains only `(q + r) % n`, and the new value `(q + r) % n` is added to the set, which means `temp` will contain the value `(q + r) % n` twice, but since sets do not allow duplicate values, `temp` will still contain only `(q + r) % n`.
- The values of `r`, `c`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than the current value of `_` remains valid.
- The value of `q` is still the second element in `ans`.
