To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `q` and the set `ans`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
- `_` is 0.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the set `ans` must still contain at least one element, and `q` must be the next element in the set `ans`.

Since the loop is iterating over the elements of the set `ans`, the state of `q` will be adjusted to the next element in the set `ans` for the next iteration. The set `ans` itself must still contain elements for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.
- `ans` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and at least one more element, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**
