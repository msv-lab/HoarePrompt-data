Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` remains an empty set, `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.***
