Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, `func_4` is called, which processes the input for that test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, processing each throw:
     - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - After processing all possible directions for the current throw, it updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Adjusting for Player Numbering**:
   - After all throws are processed, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans` to adjust for the 1-based indexing of players.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the player numbers in increasing order.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`), considering both possible directions.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n`, which is represented as `0` in modulo arithmetic.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints specified in the problem, including the number of test cases, the number of players, and the number of throws.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It processes the input, simulates the throws, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
