### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which reads a line and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which reads a line and splits it into a list of integers.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1().split()`, where `func_1()` reads a line and strips any trailing whitespace.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the players in the set `ans` in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case, and the throws as specified in the problem description.

- **Correctness of Set Initialization:**
  - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.

- **Correctness of Processing Throws:**
  - The logic for processing each throw is correct. It correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, as well as the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

- **Correctness of Adjusting for Zero Indexing:**
  - The adjustment for zero indexing is correct. It ensures that the final set of possible players is correctly represented with player numbers from 1 to `n`.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The output is correct. It prints the number of possible players and the players themselves in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, given the constraints and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
