Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the direction is '0' or '1' and the resulting position is the same as the starting position (i.e., when the ball is thrown a distance of `n` or a multiple of `n` in either direction, it should return to the same player). However, the current implementation does not account for this edge case correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 1
5 0
5 0
```
In this case, the ball should return to player 1 after each throw because the distance is 5, which is a multiple of the number of players (5). However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
1
1
```
This is because the program uses the modulo operation, which can result in a position of 0 when the ball is thrown a distance of `n` or a multiple of `n` in the clockwise direction. The program should handle this case by ensuring that the position is correctly adjusted to be within the range of 1 to `n`.
