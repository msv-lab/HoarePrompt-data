### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1().split()`. This part is also correct.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`. This ensures that the initial position of the ball is correctly tracked.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program correctly processes each throw by reading the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly, which is essential for the problem.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the players in the set `ans` in increasing order.
   - The output format matches the problem description requirements.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1:**
  - `func_1()` reads a line from the standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is correct and necessary for handling input.

- **Function 2:**
  - `func_2()` reads a line from the standard input, strips it, and converts it to an integer. This is correct and necessary for reading the number of test cases.

- **Function 3:**
  - `func_3()` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers. This is correct and necessary for reading the parameters of each test case.

- **Function 4:**
  - `func_4()` reads the parameters `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.
  - It initializes `ans` with the starting player `x`.
  - It iterates `m` times, processing each throw.
  - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
  - It correctly updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions after the current throw.
  - It adjusts for zero indexing by removing `0` and adding `n` if `0` is in `ans`.
  - It prints the number of players in `ans` and the players themselves in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, given the constraints and problem description. The input handling, set initialization, processing of throws, adjustment for zero indexing, and output are all correct and consistent with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
