Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 \le a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a valid string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**
