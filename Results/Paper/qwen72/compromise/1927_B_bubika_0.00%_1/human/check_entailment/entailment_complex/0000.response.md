### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `a` as the string of all lowercase Latin letters: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - It also initializes `b` as a list of 26 zeros, which will be used to keep track of the number of times each character in `a` has been used.

2. **Input Processing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace `s` (a list of integers).

3. **String Construction**:
   - For each integer `i` in the trace `s`, the function finds the index `x` in `b` where the value is equal to `i`. This index `x` corresponds to the position in the alphabet string `a` from which the character will be selected.
   - The character at position `x` in `a` is appended to the result string `r`.
   - The value at index `x` in `b` is incremented by 1 to reflect that the character has been used once more.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the string `r` for the current test case, the function prints `r`.
   - The function does not return any value, but it correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Trace Interpretation**:
  - The trace `a_i` represents the number of times the character at position `i` has appeared before in the string `s`.
  - The function correctly uses `b` to keep track of the number of times each character has been used, and it finds the correct character by looking for the index in `b` that matches the current trace value `i`.

- **Character Selection**:
  - The function uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of `i` in `b`, which ensures that the character selected is the next available character in the alphabet that has not been used as many times as `i`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` and the trace is `[0]` correctly by outputting a single character string.
  - It also handles the case where all trace values are `0` by outputting a string of the same character repeated `n` times.

- **Constraints**:
  - The function ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly constructs a string `s` that corresponds to the given trace for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
