The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer, and `t` should start at 0 (as it is the loop iterator).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `b` is a list of 26 zeros

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, and `t` will start at 0 and increment up to `int(input()) - 1`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, and `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
