Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a valid string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` is an integer within a certain range, and `a` is a list of integers.
- The code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` changes the value of `a` to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The precondition about the sum of `n` over all test cases and the existence of a valid string `s` for each trace `a` still holds, but now `a` is a string rather than a list of integers.
