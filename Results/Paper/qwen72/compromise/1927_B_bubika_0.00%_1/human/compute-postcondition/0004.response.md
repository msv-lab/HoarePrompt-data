The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the indices of a valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints, the function likely processes the list `a` and returns some form of output related to the string `s` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of integers representing indices of a valid string `s`). For each test case, it processes the list `a` and returns a result related to the string `s`.**
