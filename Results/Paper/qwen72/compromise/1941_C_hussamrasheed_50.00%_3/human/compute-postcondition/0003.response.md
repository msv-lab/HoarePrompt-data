The function `func` is designed to accept multiple test cases. It takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not defined in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each, but the specific output for each test case is not defined.**
