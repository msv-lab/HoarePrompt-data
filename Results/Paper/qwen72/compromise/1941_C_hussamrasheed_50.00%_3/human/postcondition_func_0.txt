The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After the function completes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use.
