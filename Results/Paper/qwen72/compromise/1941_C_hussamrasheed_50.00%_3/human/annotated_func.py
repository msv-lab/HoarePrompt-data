#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `t` should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the variable `m` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, and the variable `p` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The sum `m + p` is printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After the function completes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use.
