Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
