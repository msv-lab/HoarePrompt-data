Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, and `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `p`.
- The `hmp` object still contains the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
- The variable `ans` is updated based on the loop. For each character `i` in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG'), if `i` is not present in the input string `s`, `m` is added to `ans`. 
- After the loop completes all 7 iterations, `ans` will contain the total number of characters in `p` that are not found in `s`, multiplied by `m`.
