Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least two keys, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m` plus `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m`, plus `m - hmp[i]`.
