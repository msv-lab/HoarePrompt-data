Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least two keys, `i` is the second key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m`.***
