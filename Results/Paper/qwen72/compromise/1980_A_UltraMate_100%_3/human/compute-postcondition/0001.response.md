The only variables in the loop head are `t` and the loop variable `_`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
