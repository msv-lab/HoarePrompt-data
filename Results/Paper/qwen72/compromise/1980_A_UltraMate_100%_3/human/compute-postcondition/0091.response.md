Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It then calculates the number of characters in the string `s` that are missing from 'A' to 'G' and multiplies this count by `m`. Additionally, for each character in `s` that appears fewer than `m` times, it adds the difference `(m - frequency of the character)` to the result. Finally, the function prints the calculated result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans` being reset for each iteration. **
