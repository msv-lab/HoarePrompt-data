#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):

    len_unique = len(unique_chars)

    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse in the list. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its reverse in the list. The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In `decoded`, each character from `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in a reverse mapping defined by `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to the character at the opposite position in the sorted list of unique characters. The original `encoded` string and any intermediate variables used in the function remain unchanged.
