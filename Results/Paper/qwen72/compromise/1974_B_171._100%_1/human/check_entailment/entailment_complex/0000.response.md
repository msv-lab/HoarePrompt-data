Reasoning:  
The program follows the decoding algorithm correctly as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the integer `n` and the encoded string `b` from the list `data`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: The function `func_1` first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Decoding**: The function constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case in a list `results` and prints them one by one.

The program correctly implements the decoding process by:
- Constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string.
- Creating a symmetric mapping for these characters.
- Applying the mapping to the encoded string to produce the decoded string.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to handle all the required steps correctly and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
