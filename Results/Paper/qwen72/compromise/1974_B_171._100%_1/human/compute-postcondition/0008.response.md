The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns the string `decoded`, which is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its reverse in the list. The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, which maps each character to its reverse in the list.**
