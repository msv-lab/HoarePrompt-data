Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is true):**
   - If the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining one yogurt at the regular price. The cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is false):**
   - If the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The cost is `n // 2 * b`.

The program correctly handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts and compares the costs of buying at the regular price versus the promotional price. The logic ensures that the minimum cost is always calculated correctly based on the given conditions.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is not less than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- **Test Case 4: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is not less than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `4 // 2 * 11 = 22`.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the fourth test case. The correct output should be `20` because:
- `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`.
- Therefore, the cost should be `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program does not handle the case where `2 * a` is less than `b` correctly for even `n`. It should print `a * n` if `2 * a < b` for even `n`.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b)
```

Given the corrected program, the output for the fourth test case would be `20`, which is correct.

Correctness: **False** (The original program does not handle the even case correctly when `2 * a < b`).
