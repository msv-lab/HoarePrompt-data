Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The lists `ldb` and `sng` remain as they were initially, containing elements from `lft` based on the given conditions.
- The list `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element. This means that if there are any consecutive duplicates in `rgt`, they will be appended to `rdb` during the loop execution.
