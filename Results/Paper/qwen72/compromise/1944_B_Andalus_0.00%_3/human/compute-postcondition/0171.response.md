Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2` and otherwise `sz` remains 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
