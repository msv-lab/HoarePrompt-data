The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`i` remains `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is now `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times.**
