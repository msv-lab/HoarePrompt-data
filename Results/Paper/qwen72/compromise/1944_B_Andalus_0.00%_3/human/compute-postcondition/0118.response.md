Output State: **`sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element of `sng`, and `sz` is `sz + 3`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` is still less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `sz` is `sz + 3` (since `sz` was initially `sz + 2`).
- The conditions regarding `sng` and `elem` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on whether `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, we break out; otherwise, `sz` is still less than `k`.
