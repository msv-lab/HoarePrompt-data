The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` has `rgt[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
