Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ldb` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.
   - The current value of `k - sz` is at least 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).
   - `elem` is the first element of the list `ldb`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element of the list `ldb`)**
