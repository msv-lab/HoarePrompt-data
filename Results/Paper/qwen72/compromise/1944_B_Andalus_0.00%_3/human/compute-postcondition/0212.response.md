Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` must have at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is guaranteed to be a valid element.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `elem` will be printed twice, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the second element in the list `rdb`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element in the list `rdb`)**
