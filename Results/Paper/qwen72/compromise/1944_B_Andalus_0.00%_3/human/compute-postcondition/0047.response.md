Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `lst` is a list of input integers.
   - `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `ldb` must have at least one element.
   - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
   - The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
   - `ldb` must have at least one element, so `elem` is a valid integer.
   - The print statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and `ldb` is a list of integers, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`)
