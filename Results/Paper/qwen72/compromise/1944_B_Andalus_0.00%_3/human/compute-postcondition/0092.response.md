Postcondition: ***`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted. `sz` is now either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, with `elem` being the second element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 2 and the difference between `k` and `sz` is now greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.***
