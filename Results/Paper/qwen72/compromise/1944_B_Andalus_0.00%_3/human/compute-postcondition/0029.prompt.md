Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft`, `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists, and `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[i]`, and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. In all cases, `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`, and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[3]`, and `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
