Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to 4 or 6 depending on the new condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` remains 2.***
