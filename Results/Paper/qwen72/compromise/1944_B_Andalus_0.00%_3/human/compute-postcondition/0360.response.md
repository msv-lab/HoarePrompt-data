Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of length `2n` containing integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice. It then splits `a` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, sorts them, and identifies duplicate and single elements in `lft` and duplicate elements in `rgt`. The function prints pairs of duplicate elements from `lft` and `rgt` and single elements from `lft` to reach a total of `k` elements, ensuring that the printed elements are as specified in the code. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, `T` is 0, and the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are reset for each test case. **
