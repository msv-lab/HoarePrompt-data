The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, with `elem` being the second element in `rdb`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `rdb`.

State: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted. `sz` is now either 0 or 4, and `rdb` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, with `elem` being the third element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 4 and the difference between `k` and `sz` is now greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.**
