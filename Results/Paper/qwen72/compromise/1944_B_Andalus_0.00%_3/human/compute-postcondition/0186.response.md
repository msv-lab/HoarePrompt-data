Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist) and must have at least 1 element.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the Value of `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.
   - `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).

Given the initial state, we know that `sng` is a list with at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of this list. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list sng, and sng contains elements from lft that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements)**
