Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist) and must have at least 2 elements, `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k + 2`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.** 

The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, making it the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k + 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
