To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements
   - `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`
   - The loop or if statement we were directly inside has been exited

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop head is `for elem in sng:`
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element to iterate over.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in `sng`, for the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `elem` will be the second element in `sng` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains `n - 1`
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
   - `rdb` remains unchanged
   - `sz` remains `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times
   - `sng` must have at least 2 elements
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`**
