Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, and the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 3, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the current `elem`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the loop or statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
