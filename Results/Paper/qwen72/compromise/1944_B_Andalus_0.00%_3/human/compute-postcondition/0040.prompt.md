Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1. `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element. `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`. `rdb` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`, `rdb` is either empty or contains the value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains either empty or unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended to its previous values. Otherwise, `rdb` remains either empty or unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
