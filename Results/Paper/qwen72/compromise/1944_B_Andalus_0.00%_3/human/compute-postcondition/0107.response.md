Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `sng` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `sng`.
   - `sz` is the size of `sng`.
   - `k` is a variable that is compared with `sz`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determination**:
   - Since `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `sng` is guaranteed to have at least one element, the `print` statement will always print the first element of `sng`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the first element of the list `sng`.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the first element of `sng` followed by a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element of the list sng)**
