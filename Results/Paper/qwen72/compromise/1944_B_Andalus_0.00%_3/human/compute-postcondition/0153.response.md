The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[1]` (which is equal to `rgt[0]`).**
