Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
