The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. 

Since the output is not specified, we can only infer that the function processes these inputs and returns some value or values. Without more information, the exact nature of the return value cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where it processes `t` test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99), and returns a result based on these inputs.**
