Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length exponent. This is a valid approach to keep track of how many sticks have each length.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - **Three Sticks of the Same Length**: If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This is correct because the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)` gives the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items.
   - **Two Sticks of the Same Length and One Different**: If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and one stick from the remaining sticks using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. This is also correct because `math.comb(cnt, 2)` gives the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks, and `total_sum` gives the total number of sticks with different lengths.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of valid ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n < 3`, the program will not enter the loops for calculating combinations, and the result will be 0, which is correct.
   - If all sticks have different lengths, the program will correctly output 0 because no combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with 7 sticks all of length \(2^1\), the program correctly calculates 35 ways to choose 3 sticks.
   - For the second test case with sticks of lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\), the program correctly calculates 2 ways: (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 4).
   - For the third test case with sticks of lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), the program correctly outputs 0 because no combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - For the fourth test case with a single stick, the program correctly outputs 0 because there are not enough sticks to form a triangle.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
