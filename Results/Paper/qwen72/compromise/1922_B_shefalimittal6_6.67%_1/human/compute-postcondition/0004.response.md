Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of stick lengths. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. The result for each test case is printed to the console. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the input has been fully processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the internal variables are reset for each test case. **
