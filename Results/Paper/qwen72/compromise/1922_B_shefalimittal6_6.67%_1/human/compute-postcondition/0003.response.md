The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `stick_lengths`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `stick_lengths` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the exponents of the stick lengths. Each inner list has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines some property or value based on the exponents of the stick lengths provided in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `stick_lengths`, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list contains integers representing the exponents of stick lengths. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the exponents of the stick lengths provided.**
