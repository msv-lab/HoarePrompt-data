Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`. This is correct as the input is a single string of balanced parentheses.

2. **Balance Calculation**: Inside `func_1`, the program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. It sets `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character. This is a good starting point for calculating the balance.

3. **Balance Update**: The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d` based on whether the current character is an opening or closing parenthesis. This is done correctly:
   - For an opening parenthesis `(`, the balance is incremented.
   - For a closing parenthesis `)`, the balance is decremented.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation**: After calculating the balance for each position, the program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the sorting step.

5. **Sorting**: The program sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (prefix balance) in increasing order. In case of ties (same balance), it sorts by position in decreasing order. This is the correct approach to achieve the balanced shuffle as described in the problem statement.

6. **Constructing the Result**: The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary. This is the correct way to form the balanced shuffle.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(n)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

However, there is a small issue in the sorting step. The problem specifies that in case of ties, the positions should be sorted in decreasing order. The current implementation sorts the positions in increasing order, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the sorting key should be modified to sort by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order:

```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
```

Given this issue, the program is not correct as it does not handle the tie-breaking condition correctly.

Correctness: **False**
