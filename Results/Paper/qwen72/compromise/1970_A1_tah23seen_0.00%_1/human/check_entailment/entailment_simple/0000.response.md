### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` and prints the result.
   - The input string `n` is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
     - `d` is a dictionary initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance of the empty prefix.
   - **Balance Calculation**:
     - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`.
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - **Dictionary Manipulation**:
     - The last entry in the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the balance of the entire string) is removed using `d.pop(n)`.
     - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in increasing order, and in case of ties, by the positions in decreasing order.
   - **Constructing the Result**:
     - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - **Return**:
     - The function returns the string `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of each prefix of the input string.
   - It sorts the positions based on the balance values, which ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The final string `ans` is constructed by appending characters from `s` in the order of the sorted positions, which should result in the balanced shuffle of the input string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case of a single character input (e.g., "()" or "(()())") correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance of each prefix, sorts the positions based on the balance, and constructs the result string accordingly.

**Correctness: True**
