Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Set Operations**:
   - The problem specifies that the set `S` should only contain unique elements. However, the program does not handle this correctly. It adds elements to the list `a` and then converts it to a set, which removes duplicates. This is not the same as the set operations described in the problem, where duplicates are not added in the first place.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Lexicographically Largest Array**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` by sorting the unique elements of `a` in descending order and then trying to fill in the gaps. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the correct way to maximize the lexicographical order by selecting the optimal index `i` for each operation.

3. **Incorrect Use of Counter**:
   - The `Counter` is used to keep track of the frequency of elements in `a`, but the program does not use it correctly to ensure that the elements are added to the set `S` in the correct order.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to simulate the operations as described:

1. **Simulate the Operations**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, you need to decide the optimal index `i` to select such that the element `a[i] + i` is maximized and added to the set `S`.

2. **Construct the Lexicographically Largest Array**:
   - After all operations, the set `S` should contain the unique elements. You then need to sort these elements in descending order to form the array `b`.

3. **Ensure Correctness**:
   - The program should ensure that the elements are added to the set `S` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Set Operations**: For each element in the array `a`, it adds `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S`.
- **Sorting and Output**: After all operations, it sorts the set `S` in descending order to form the array `b` and prints it.

This approach ensures that the set `S` contains the correct elements and that the array `b` is constructed to be lexicographically largest.
