Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative because each element in `a` has been decremented at least once), `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements that were added to fill the gap between consecutive elements in `a` to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative), `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`, the last element of `ans` is now `ans[-1] - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative), `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, the last element of `ans` is now `ans[-2] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative), `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, the last element of `ans` is now `ans[-2] - 1`, and the new last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
