Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than `len(a)`, `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `ans` has been appended with the value `a[i - 1] - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 2`, `adv` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - 2` to the list `ans`.
- The initial state indicates that `ans` has already been appended with the value `a[i - 1] - 1`.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will have two values: `a[i - 1] - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 2`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `counter[a[0]]`, `j`, and `adv` remain unchanged.
