Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than `len(a)`, `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` has been appended with the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[0] - a[1] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[0]]`, `cnt` is now `cnt - adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is now `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decremented by `adv`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
