The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 0**
