Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `m` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by iterating over `s` and appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by 'L' or 'R'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, and the returned list contains the cumulative product of these integers, modulo `m`, in reverse order. **
