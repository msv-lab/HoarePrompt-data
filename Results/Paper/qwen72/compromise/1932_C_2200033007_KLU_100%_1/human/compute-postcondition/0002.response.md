Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.** 

The value of `r` is now `n - 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
