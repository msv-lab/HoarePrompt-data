Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^4, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is the result of the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.**
