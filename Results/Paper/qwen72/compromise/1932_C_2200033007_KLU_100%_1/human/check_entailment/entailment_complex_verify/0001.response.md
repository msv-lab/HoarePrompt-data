### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainder:**
   - The program initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order:
     - For each element `v`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m`.
     - It appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`.
   - This part of the program is also correct. By iterating through `b` in reverse order, it correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step, modulo `m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the elements at the beginning of each command execution.
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case.
   - The use of `reversed` in the final step ensures that the remainders are printed in the order they were calculated, which matches the problem requirements.

### Annotations Verification:
- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
  - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
  - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

- **State After Command Processing:**
  - `b` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^4.
  - `l` is `n` and `r` is `-1` after processing all commands.
  - This is correct. The pointers `l` and `r` are used to traverse the array `a` from both ends, and they will indeed be `n` and `-1` respectively after all elements are removed.

- **State After Product Calculation:**
  - `ans` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is the result of the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`.
  - `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
  - This is correct. The product is calculated step by step, and the results are stored in `ans` in reverse order.

- **Final State:**
  - The program returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is the result of the product of the elements in `b` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`.
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.
