Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd, Maxim will need to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest in pairs.
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, then the minimum cost is `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, the minimum cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and one yogurt at the regular price).

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs.
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, then the minimum cost is `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, the minimum cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price).

The logic appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example. Let's verify the example cases:

- **Test Case 1: `2 5 9`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`.
  - Since `10 > 9`, the minimum cost is `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (correct).

- **Test Case 2: `3 5 9`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`.
  - Since `10 > 9`, the minimum cost is `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (correct).

- **Test Case 3: `3 5 11`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`.
  - Since `10 < 11`, the minimum cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (correct).

- **Test Case 4: `4 5 11`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`.
  - Since `10 < 11`, the minimum cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (correct).

All the test cases in the example are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
