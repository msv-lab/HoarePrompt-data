### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buying one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`). The total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling odd and even numbers of yogurts is correct.
- The program correctly checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price.
- The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even numbers of yogurts.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly (it will always buy one yogurt at the regular price).
- The program handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly (it will compare the cost of buying two yogurts individually versus the promotion price).
- The program handles larger values of `n` correctly by breaking down the problem into pairs and handling the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
