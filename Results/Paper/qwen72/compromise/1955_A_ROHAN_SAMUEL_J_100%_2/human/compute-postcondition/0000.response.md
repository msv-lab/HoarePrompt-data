The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are also not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
