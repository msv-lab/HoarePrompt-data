Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first character of each string is always '.'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the string `s` up to the point where the second '*' character is encountered, `thorn` is 2 if the loop breaks due to encountering the second '*', otherwise `thorn` is the number of consecutive '*' characters encountered, and `i` is the last character processed in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character, `thorn` is 2 if a second '*' character is encountered, otherwise `thorn` is 0, `i` is the last character processed in the loop, `_` is the number of characters processed before the loop breaks or completes, and `len` remains the initial input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` remains a list of characters from the input string. `ret` is the number of times the character `@` appeared in the string before the second occurrence of `*`. `thorn` is 2 if the second `*` was encountered, otherwise it is 0. `i` is the last character processed in the loop, which could be any character from the string. `_` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop ran, which is equal to the number of characters processed before the loop broke or completed. `len` remains the integer value of the input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
