Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` reaches 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ret` remains unchanged. If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to '@' or '*', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` remains unchanged.***
