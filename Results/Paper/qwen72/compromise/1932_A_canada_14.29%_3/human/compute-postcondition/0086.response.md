Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s` and is currently equal to `@`, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input.** 

The value of `ret` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
