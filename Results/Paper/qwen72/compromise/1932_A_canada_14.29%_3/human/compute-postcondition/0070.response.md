Output State: **`s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, `ret` is 0 if the first character is not '@', otherwise `ret` is 1. If `i` (the second character) is '@', `ret` is 2. If `i` (the second character) is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0 if the first character is not '*' and is not '@', and the condition `thorn == 0` is checked and remains true. `thorn` is now 1.**
