Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` reaches 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '@' or '*', `thorn` remains 0.***
