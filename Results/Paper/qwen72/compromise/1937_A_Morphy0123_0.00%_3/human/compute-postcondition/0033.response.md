Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1.
   - `n` must be greater than \(2^{(\text{power} - 1)}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). This means `power` is the smallest integer for which \(2^{\text{power}}\) is at least `n`.
   - However, the precondition also states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. This is a bit unusual because `power` is typically a logarithmic value, but we must adhere to the given precondition.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` will evaluate to \(2^n\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output \(2^n\), where `n` is the value of `power`.

Output: **2^n (where n is the value of power and power is equal to n)**
