The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2, which implies that `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
