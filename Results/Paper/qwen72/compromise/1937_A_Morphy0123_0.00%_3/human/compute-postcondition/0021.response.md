The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n_cases` is greater than 0

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1
- `n_cases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again

The values of `n` and `power` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.**
