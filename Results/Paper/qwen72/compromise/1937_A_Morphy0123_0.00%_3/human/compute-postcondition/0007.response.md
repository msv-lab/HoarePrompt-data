To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`. The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1
   - `power` is 1

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`.
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For `power < log2(n)` to be true, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.
   - `log2(n) > 1` implies that `n > 2` (since `log2(2) = 1`).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The initial state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `n > 2`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
