To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `power < log2(n)`.

1. **Variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.
2. **Current state**:
   - `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n_cases` is greater than 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `power` is 1.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`.
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - `log2(n) > 1` implies that `n > 2` (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(4) = 2`).
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The state of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 2.
   - No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
