Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\), `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n_cases` remains greater than 2, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) for the loop to have executed the required number of times. This is because the loop increments `power` by 1 each time, and the loop condition `power < log2(n)` must be true for the loop to execute.
- The variable `power` will be \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\) after the loop finishes executing. This is because the loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than \(\log_2(n)\). The floor function \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\), and adding 1 ensures that `power` is exactly one more than this value when the loop exits.
