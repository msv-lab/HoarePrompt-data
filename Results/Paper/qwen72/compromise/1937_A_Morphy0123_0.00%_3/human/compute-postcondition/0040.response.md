Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than 2^(power-1). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is one less than the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is assigned the input integer.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `n` and `power` are still valid as they were in the initial state.
