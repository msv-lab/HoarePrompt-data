Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 1.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `power` to 1. The values of `i`, `n_cases`, and `n` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `n` and `power` are not affected by this initialization, so they still hold as stated in the initial state.
