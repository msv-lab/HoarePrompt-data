Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer input, and it is given that `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. This means `power` is the ceiling of `log2(n)`.
   - It is also given that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. This implies that `n` itself is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

3. **Implications:**
   - For `power` to be equal to `n`, `n` must be a power of 2. This is because the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` is `n` only if `n` is a power of 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be a power of 2, and `power` must be `n`.

4. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet `print(2 ** power)` will print `2` raised to the power of `n`.
   - Since `n` is a power of 2, `2 ** n` will be `2` raised to the power of `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is a power of 2 and power is equal to n)**
