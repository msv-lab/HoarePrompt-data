You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a specific value based on the following logic: If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints `2

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with an array \( a \) where \( a_i = i \) for each \( 1 \le i \le n \).
   - We perform the operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - The operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) swaps the elements \( a_d \) and \( a_i \), where \( d \) is the largest divisor of \( i \) that is not equal to \( i \) itself.
   - We need to find the position \( j \) such that \( a_j = 1 \) after all the swaps.

2. **Analyzing the Swap Operation:**
   - For \( i = 2 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 1. So, \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 3 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 1. So, \( a_1 \) and \( a_3 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 4 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 2. So, \( a_2 \) and \( a_4 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 5 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 1. So, \( a_1 \) and \( a_5 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 6 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 3. So, \( a_3 \) and \( a_6 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 7 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 1. So, \( a_1 \) and \( a_7 \) are swapped.
   - For \( i = 8 \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 4. So, \( a_4 \) and \( a_8 \) are swapped.
   - And so on...

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Notice that for each \( i \) that is a power of 2 (i.e., \( i = 2^k \)), the largest divisor \( d \) is \( 2^{k-1} \). This means that \( a_{2^{k-1}} \) and \( a_{2^k} \) are swapped.
   - For other values of \( i \), the largest divisor \( d \) is 1, which means \( a_1 \) and \( a_i \) are swapped.

4. **Final Position of 1:**
   - The element 1 will be swapped with \( a_i \) for each \( i \) that is not a power of 2.
   - The element 1 will be moved to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) after all the swaps.

5. **Algorithm:**
   - If \( n = 1 \), the array is \([1]\) and the position of 1 is 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), we need to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).
   - This can be done by finding the integer part of \( \log_2(n) \) and then computing \( 2^{\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor} \).

6. **Reviewing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \).
   - If \( n = 1 \), it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) by incrementing \( \text{power} \) until \( 2^{\text{power}} \) is greater than \( n \).
   - If \( \text{power} \) is equal to \( n \), it prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( 2^{\text{power} - 1} \).

7. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \).
   - However, the logic for finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) is incorrect. The loop should stop when \( 2^{\text{power}} \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), not just greater than \( n \).
   - The correct approach is to use \( \text{power} = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor \) and then print \( 2^{\text{power}} \).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \). It should use \( \text{power} = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor \) and then print \( 2^{\text{power}} \). The current logic can lead to incorrect results for certain values of \( n \).
