The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, `i` is a loop variable that will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, the list of strings `s` remains unchanged, and each string in `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
