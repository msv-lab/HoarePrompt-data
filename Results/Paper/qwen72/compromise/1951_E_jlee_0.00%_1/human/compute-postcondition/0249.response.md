Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or greater, and `done` is a boolean. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, `done` remains unchanged.***
