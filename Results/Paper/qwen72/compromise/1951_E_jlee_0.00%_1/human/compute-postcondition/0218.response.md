Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 0, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1 and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count2` is set to `count` and `done` is True if `count` > 1; if `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, then `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
