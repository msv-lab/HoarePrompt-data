Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `count2` is 0.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `done` is set to True.
- Additionally, `count2` is equal to `count`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of them.

Output: **YES**
