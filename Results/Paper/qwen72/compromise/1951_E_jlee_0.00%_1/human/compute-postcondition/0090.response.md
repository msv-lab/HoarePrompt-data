Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count2` is 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: The value of `j` is 1.
2. **Value of `string`**: The value of `string` is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
3. **Value of `s`**: The value of `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` is the length of the list `s`.

### What the `print` statement does:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j` to the end.

Since `j` is 1, the `print` statement will split the string `string` into two parts:
- The first part will be the substring from the start to the character at index 0 (i.e., the first character).
- The second part will be the substring from the character at index 1 to the end.

### Output:
Output: **[first character of string], [remaining characters of string]**

This means the output will be the first character of the string followed by a comma and a space, and then the rest of the string starting from the second character. For example, if `string` is "hello", the output will be "h, ello".
