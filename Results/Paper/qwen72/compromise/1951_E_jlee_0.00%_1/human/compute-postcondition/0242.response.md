Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
4. `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
5. `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1.
6. `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
7. `j` is 1.
8. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is not changed. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 or greater and `done` is not changed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their conditions, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
