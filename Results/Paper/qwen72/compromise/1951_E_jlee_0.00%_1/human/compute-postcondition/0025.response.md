Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
5. `n` is the length of the list `s`.
6. `done` is False.
7. `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
8. `x` is not equal to the last character of the list `s`.
9. The count of `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`.
10. The count of `x` in the list `s` is not equal to `n`.
11. Either `n % 2 == 0` or `s[(n - 1) // 2] == x`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the implications:

- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `x` is not equal to the last character of the list `s`.
- The count of `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`, meaning there is exactly one character in the list `s` that is not `x`.
- The count of `x` is not equal to `n`, which is consistent with the previous point.
- Either the length of the list `s` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), or the middle character of the list `s` is `x` (`s[(n - 1) // 2] == x`).

Given these conditions, the list `s` must have the following structure:
- The list `s` contains `n - 1` occurrences of `x` and one occurrence of a different character.
- The different character cannot be the first or the middle character (if `n` is odd) or the first character (if `n` is even).

The print statement is:
```
print('YES')
```

Since the conditions are met and the print statement simply prints the string 'YES', the output will be:

Output: **YES**
