To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character.
   - `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `count` > 0, `count2` is 0 or 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if:
     - `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, or
     - `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, or
     - `count2` > `count`.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `done` remains False.
   - If `count` <= 0, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Since the `print('YES')` statement is unconditional and does not rely on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state, it will always print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
