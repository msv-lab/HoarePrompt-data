Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.**
