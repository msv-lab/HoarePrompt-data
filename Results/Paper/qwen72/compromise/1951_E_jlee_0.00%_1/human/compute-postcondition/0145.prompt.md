Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `count` is greater than 0, which means that there exists a `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then: if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True; if `count2` is equal to `count`, then: if `count` > 1, `done` is True and `count2` is equal to `count`; if `count` is 1, `done` is False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True; if `count2` is 0, `done` remains False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1 and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, all variables retain their initial values and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 0, `count2` is 0 or 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, or if `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, or if `count2` > `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `done` remains False. If `count` <= 0, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is 2. If `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `done` is True and `count2` is 0. If `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True and `count2` is 0. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is True and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` remains unchanged and `count2` is 1. Otherwise, `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False. If `count` <= 0, the values of `count`, `done`, and `count2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
