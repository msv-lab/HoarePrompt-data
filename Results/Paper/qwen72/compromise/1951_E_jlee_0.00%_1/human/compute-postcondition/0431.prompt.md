Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; the list of strings `s` remains unchanged, and each string in `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `x` after `count` is set, or 0 if `count` is 0, and `done` is False. If `done` is False, the program maintains the initial state of all variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is a boolean. If `done` is False, then `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is the number of times `x` appears in `s` up to the index `j`. If `done` is True, the values of `count` and `count2` depend on the conditions that caused the loop to break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is the number of characters in `s` that are not equal to `x` and are found in the first half of the list, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` and are found in the first half of the list after the first occurrence of a character not equal to `x`. If `done` is False, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
