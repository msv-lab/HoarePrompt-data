Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count2` is 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` will be the substring from index `j` to the end of `string`.

3. **Substrings:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "abcde":
- `string[:j]` will be "a".
- `string[j:]` will be "bcde".

So, the output will be:
Output: **a, bcde**
