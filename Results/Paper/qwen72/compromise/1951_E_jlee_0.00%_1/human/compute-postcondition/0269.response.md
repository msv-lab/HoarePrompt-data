Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is 0 or greater.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `j - 1`:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, `j - 1` is 1.

2. **Determine the value of `string[:j - 1]`:**
   - This is a slice of the string `string` from the beginning up to but not including the character at index 1.
   - Since `j - 1` is 1, `string[:j - 1]` is the substring consisting of the first character of `string`.

3. **Determine the value of `string[j - 1:]`:**
   - This is a slice of the string `string` starting from the character at index 1 to the end of the string.
   - Since `j - 1` is 1, `string[j - 1:]` is the substring consisting of all characters from the second character of `string` to the end.

4. **Combine the results:**
   - The `print` statement will print two substrings: the first character of `string` and the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "abcde":
- `string[:1]` is "a".
- `string[1:]` is "bcde".
- The output will be: **a, bcde**.
