Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` is False. If `n` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues with the current values of the variables. If `s.count(x) == n`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program continues with the current values of the variables.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is set to True, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 0, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` remains unchanged. `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is False. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, `count` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is 0, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. `count2` remains 0 if `count2` is 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `count2` remains unchanged. `done` is True if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` and `count` > 1, or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and `j` is 2. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is incremented by 2, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` > 1, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
