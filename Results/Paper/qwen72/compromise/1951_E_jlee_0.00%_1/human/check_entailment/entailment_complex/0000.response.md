### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a string `string`.
   - The string is converted to a list of characters `s` and its length `n` is calculated.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string length `n` is 1, the function correctly prints 'NO' because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function correctly prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

3. **Uniform Character Check:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints 'NO' because any substring of a uniform string is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different from `x`. If it is, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

4. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of the string to find a non-palindromic split.
   - If it finds a pair of characters that are not the same (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`), it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If it finds a character that is different from `x` (`s[j] != x`), it tries to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings. The logic for this split is complex but aims to ensure that the split results in non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If no valid split is found, the function prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- The logic for splitting the string into two non-palindromic substrings is overly complex and may not always produce the correct result. For example, the conditions involving `count` and `count2` are not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect splits.
- The function does not handle the case where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic substrings of length 2 or more, which is a valid solution according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the edge cases and some simple cases.
- However, the logic for splitting the string into two non-palindromic substrings is flawed and may not always produce the correct result.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function is incorrect due to the overly complex and potentially flawed logic for splitting the string into non-palindromic substrings. A simpler and more robust approach is needed to ensure that the program always produces the correct output.
