### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input in competitive programming, especially when the input is large and needs to be processed efficiently.
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and initializes the `index` to keep track of the position in the input list.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` to store the cumulative XOR of elements in the array `a`. This is a crucial step for efficiently answering the queries.
   - The prefix XOR array is built correctly using the formula `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where it occurs. This allows for quick lookups to check if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - The dictionary is initialized with `mp[0].append(0)` to handle the case where the subarray itself has a XOR of 0.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR `x` is 0, the subarray is trivially interesting, and the program correctly appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR `x` is not 0, the program checks if there exist indices `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and both indices are within the range `[l, r]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - The condition `if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR values. If this condition is met, the program appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all queries, which is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to a query.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It efficiently uses a prefix XOR array and a dictionary to handle the queries, and the conditions for checking the interesting property are correctly implemented.

**Correctness: **True****

The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description and constraints.
