Output State: **`v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 2, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 2, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 4`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the last element of `results` is 'YES' and `results` has an additional 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = int(data[index])` updates the value of `l` to `int(data[index])`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific value of `l` after this assignment depends on the value at `data[index]`. The rest of the initial state remains valid.
