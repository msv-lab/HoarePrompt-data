Output State: **`index` is `5 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[index + 1])` to `q`. The initial state of `q` being greater than 0 is updated to a specific value based on the value at `data[index + 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
