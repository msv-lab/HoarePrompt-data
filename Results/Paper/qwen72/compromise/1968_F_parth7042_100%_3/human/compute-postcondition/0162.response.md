Output State: **`index` is `8 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` contains the list `[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The code `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[1]` to be the result of `pf[0]` (which is 0) XOR `a[1]` (which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`).
- Since `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is now `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
