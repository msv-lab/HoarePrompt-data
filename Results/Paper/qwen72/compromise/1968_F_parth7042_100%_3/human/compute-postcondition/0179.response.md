Output State: **`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operation.
- The values of `_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- The initial state information for `_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `index` is still valid and included in the output state.
