Output State: **`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. If `x` is 0, `results` is a list with the last element being 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]` assigns the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`.
- All other variables (`_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if x is 0` and its consequences (if `x` is 0, `results` is a list with the last element being 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped) is still valid and remains part of the output state.
