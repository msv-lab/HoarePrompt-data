Output State: **`_` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 1, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then the last element of `results` is 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of the element at the position `index + 1` in the list `data`.
- The initial state is unchanged for all other variables, and the conditions and logic involving `results` remain the same.
- The only change is in the value of `r`, which is now explicitly defined as `int(data[index + 1])`.
