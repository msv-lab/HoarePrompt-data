Output State: **`pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `pf[i]` is updated to the result of the XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.
- The value of `i` is appended to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
