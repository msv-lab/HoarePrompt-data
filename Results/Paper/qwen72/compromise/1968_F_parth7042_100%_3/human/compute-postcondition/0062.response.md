The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the variable `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must still be greater than 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `index` is `7 + n`
- `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3
- `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index
- `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs
- `_` is 1
- `q` must be greater than 1
- `l` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`
- `r` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`
- `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`
- `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs
- `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs
- `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order
- `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`
- `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO'. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must still be greater than 1.
