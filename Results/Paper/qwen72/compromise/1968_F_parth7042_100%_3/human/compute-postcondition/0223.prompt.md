Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `i` is `n`, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then the last element of `results` is 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 1, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 4`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the last element of `results` is 'YES' and `results` has an additional 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 2, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 2, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 6`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`, then `results` has a new element `'YES'` appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has an additional element `'NO'` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
