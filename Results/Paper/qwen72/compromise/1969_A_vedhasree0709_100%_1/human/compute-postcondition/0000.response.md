The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct, `_` is a placeholder, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
