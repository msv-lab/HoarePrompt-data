Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `l_i` satisfies 1 <= l_i <= n and l_i â‰  i. The function then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed either `2` or `3` for each test case, depending on the condition being met or not. **
