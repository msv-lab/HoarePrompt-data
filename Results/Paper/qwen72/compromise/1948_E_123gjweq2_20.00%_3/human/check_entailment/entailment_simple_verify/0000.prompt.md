You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 2n, and n and k are the parameters that define the size of the graph and the condition for adding edges between vertices.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: - After the loop, the list `arr` will be divided into `cliques` segments.
    #   - Each segment will contain the value `i + 1` where `i` is the index of the segment.
    #   - The list `cliquess` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 2 2 3 (where the elements are the values of the segments as described by the initial state)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the original list of segments before the loop)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: elements of `cliquess` (where `cliquess` is the unchanged list of elements)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right and (right - left + 1) is the number of elements to be assigned in the array arr. clique is an integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the elements in the range [left, right] in the cliquess array. arr and cliquess are lists of integers with at least (right - left + 1) elements each.

    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i

    #State: The elements in the range `[left, left + mid - 1]` of the `arr` list are assigned values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively. The elements in the same range of the `cliquess` list are all assigned the value `clique`. The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The elements in the range `[left, left + mid - 1]` of the `arr` list are assigned values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively. The elements in the range `[left + mid, left + mid + not_mid - 1]` of the `arr` list are assigned values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` respectively. The elements in the same range of the `cliquess` list are all assigned the value `clique`. The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \). According to the problem description, if \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a complete graph, and all vertices should belong to a single clique. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `make_array` does not account for this scenario and will still attempt to partition the vertices into multiple cliques, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \). The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
This is incorrect because the graph should be partitioned into a single clique when \( k \ge n \).
