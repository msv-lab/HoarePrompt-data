Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Global Variables and Function Calls**:
   - The `make_array` function modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` lists, which are defined as global variables in the `func_1` function. However, the function `make_array` is not defined to take these lists as arguments, and it assumes they are available in the global scope. This can lead to issues if the function is called in a different context where these variables are not defined.

2. **Incorrect Clique Assignment**:
   - The `make_array` function is supposed to assign values to the vertices and determine the cliques. However, the logic for assigning the values and cliques is flawed. Specifically, the way the `mid` and `not_mid` variables are calculated and used in the loops does not ensure that the vertices are correctly assigned to form the minimum number of cliques.

3. **Edge Condition Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge conditions correctly, especially when `k` is large relative to `n`. For example, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program should be able to form a single clique, but the current logic may not achieve this.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not print the output in the correct format for multiple test cases. It should print the results for each test case separately, but the current implementation does not handle this properly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `solve` function is defined to handle a single test case. It calculates the number of cliques and assigns the values to the vertices and the cliques.

2. **Vertex Assignment**:
   - The `arr` list is initialized with the values from 1 to `n`, which ensures that all vertices have distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` list is initialized such that each vertex is assigned to a clique based on its index. The expression `(i // k) + 1` ensures that vertices are grouped into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list for each test case.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
