The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. It returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `m`, or `a`. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the return value, which indicates the number of additional problems required.
