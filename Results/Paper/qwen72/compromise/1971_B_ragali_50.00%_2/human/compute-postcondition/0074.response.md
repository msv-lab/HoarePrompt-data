Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, and the set `a` contains more than one unique character; `i` has taken on the values of all characters in `s` during the loop; `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (starting from the middle) with the first half of `s` (up to the middle); `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`; and `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.***
