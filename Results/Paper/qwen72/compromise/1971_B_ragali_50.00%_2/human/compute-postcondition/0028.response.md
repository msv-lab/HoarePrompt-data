Output State: **`s` is a new string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the integer value that is 1 more than the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `a` contains all unique characters from the new `s`; `t` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of the new `s` with the first half of the new `s`, and if `newstr` is not equal to the new `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to the new `s`. If `newstr` is equal to the new `s`, then `newstr` is equal to the new `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to the new `s`, then `isreverse` is the reversed string of the new `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, no changes are made to the new `s`, `i`, or `a`.**
