The only objects in the loop head are the string `s` and the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed. The variable `i` has taken on the values of the characters in `s` during the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still have at least one more character for `i` to take on.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` remains a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` will take on the next character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`; `i` will take on the next character in `s`**
