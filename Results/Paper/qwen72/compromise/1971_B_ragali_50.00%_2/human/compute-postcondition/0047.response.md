Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
2. `i` is the last character of `s`.
3. `a` is a set that contains all unique characters from `s`, and the set `a` contains more than one unique character.
4. `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle).
5. `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`.
6. `newstr` is equal to `s`.
7. `isreverse` is equal to `s`.

### Analysis:
- Since `newstr` is equal to `s`, and `newstr` is formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, it implies that `s` must be a palindrome.
- Additionally, since `isreverse` is equal to `s`, it confirms that `s` is indeed a palindrome.
- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) concatenated with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle) will result in the original string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Determine the middle index of `s`:**
   - `len(s) // 2` gives the middle index of the string `s`.
   - If `s` has an even length, `len(s) // 2` will be the index of the first character in the second half.
   - If `s` has an odd length, `len(s) // 2` will be the index of the middle character.

2. **Extract the second half of `s`:**
   - `s[len(s) // 2:]` extracts the substring from the middle index to the end of the string.

3. **Extract the first half of `s`:**
   - `s[0:len(s) // 2]` extracts the substring from the start of the string to the middle index.

4. **Concatenate the two halves:**
   - `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` concatenates the second half with the first half.

5. **Print the result:**
   - Since `s` is a palindrome, the second half concatenated with the first half will result in the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the original string `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the original string)**
