Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is 1 greater than the last integer value of `i` used in the loop; `a` is an empty set; if `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `a` contains exactly one unique character. `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
