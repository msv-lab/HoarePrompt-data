Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the number of winners based on the initial number of players `b` and the sequence `a`. However, the function simply checks if `a` (which should be an integer representing the first element of the sequence `a`) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of players), and returns `a - 1` if true, or `b` otherwise. This logic does not match the game's rules at all.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Incorrect Function Logic**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the game rounds as described. It just performs a simple comparison and arithmetic operation, which does not reflect the complex process of removing players based on the sequence `a`.
2. **Misinterpretation of Input**: The function `func_1` treats `a` as a single integer rather than a list of integers, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.
3. **Lack of Game Simulation**: The function does not simulate the rounds of the game where players are removed based on the positions specified in the sequence `a`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
