The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` unique integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= k <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 100), and `b` is a list of `q` integers (1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100). The function attempts to compare `a` and `b`. If the comparison `a <= b` evaluates to `True`, the function will raise an error due to an invalid operation (`a - 1`). If the comparison evaluates to `False`, the function returns the list `b`. In the latter case, the final state of the program is that `b` is returned unchanged.
