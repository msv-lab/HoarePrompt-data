Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually in `func_2`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones up to each house and stores them in the list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains the cumulative count of zeros and ones up to the i-th house, starting from `[0, 0]`. This is done correctly using a loop.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates through each possible position to place the road (from 0 to n). For each position `i`, it checks:
     - The number of zeros on the left side (`left`) is at least half of the number of houses on the left side (`lsum`).
     - The number of ones on the right side (`right`) is at least half of the number of houses on the right side (`rsum`).
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are used to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - The program selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions. This ensures that the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1` to handle the case where no valid position is found, but the problem guarantees that an answer always exists, so this is not a concern.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal position for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases:
     - If the road is placed before the first house (`i = 0`), it checks the condition for the right side.
     - If the road is placed after the last house (`i = n`), it checks the condition for the left side.
     - For any other position `i`, it checks the conditions for both sides.

Given the thorough handling of all potential cases and the correct implementation of the logic, the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
