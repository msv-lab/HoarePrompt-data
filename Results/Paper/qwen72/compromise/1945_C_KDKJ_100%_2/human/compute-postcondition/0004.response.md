Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer from the standard input representing the number of test cases. It then calls the function `func_1` for each test case. After the function completes, the number of times `func_1` has been called is equal to the integer value read from the input, and the initial state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged. **
