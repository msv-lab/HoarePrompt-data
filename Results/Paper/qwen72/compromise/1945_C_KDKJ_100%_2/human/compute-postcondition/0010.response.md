Functionality: ** The function reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a string `a`. It then processes the string `a` to create a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's encountered in `a` up to that point, starting from `[0, 0]`. The function calculates an integer `ans` based on the conditions that the cumulative counts of '0's and non-'0's in the left and right segments of the string `a` must satisfy certain criteria. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. **
