Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the difference between consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
