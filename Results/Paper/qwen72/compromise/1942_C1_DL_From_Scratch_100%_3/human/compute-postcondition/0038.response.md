Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is 0 or 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`, and `T` is `T - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
