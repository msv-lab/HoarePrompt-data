Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, `x` is greater than 1, `i` is `x - 2`, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, for the first `x - 1` elements, and `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. The current value of `num` is 1.**
