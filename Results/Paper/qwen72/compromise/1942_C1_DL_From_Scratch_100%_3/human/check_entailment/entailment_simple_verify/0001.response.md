### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires forming non-intersecting diagonals using the given vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The program correctly identifies the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and counts the number of adjacent pairs.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of triangles. This is because:
     - `count` represents the number of triangles formed by adjacent vertices.
     - `x - 3` represents the number of triangles formed by non-adjacent vertices.
     - Adding these together gives `count + (x - 3) + 1 = count + x - 2`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It reads the list of `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the gap between each pair of consecutive vertices. If the gap is 1, it increments the counter.
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Finally, it prints the result as `count + x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Gap Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices and counts the number of adjacent pairs.
   - **Cyclic Gap**: The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the last and the first vertex.
   - **Formula**: The formula `count + x - 2` is correct for the given problem. It accounts for the triangles formed by adjacent vertices and the triangles formed by non-adjacent vertices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **x = 2**: The program correctly outputs 0 because no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices.
   - **x = n**: The program correctly outputs `x - 2` because every pair of consecutive vertices can form a triangle with the next vertex.
   - **General Case**: The program correctly handles the general case by counting the adjacent pairs and using the formula to calculate the total number of triangles.

6. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(x \log x)\) due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(x)\) for storing the list of chosen vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Final: **True**
