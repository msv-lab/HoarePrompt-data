Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of invitations needed. The program checks if a friend's best friend is also their best friend (i.e., if `v[v[i]] == i`), and if so, it prints `2` and returns. This works for some cases but fails for others.

For example, in the second test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will print `3`, but the correct answer is `2`. The correct approach should be to find the smallest cycle in the best friend relationships and ensure that at least two friends from this cycle are invited. In this case, the cycle is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and inviting any two friends from this cycle will ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

The program should be modified to correctly handle all cases, including those with cycles of different lengths.
