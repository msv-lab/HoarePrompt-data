### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp has `n` friends.
   - Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` such that `p_i` is distinct and `p_i` is not equal to `i`.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It reads the number of friends `n`.
     - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
     - It reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1.
     - It iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
     - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means if the best friend of `i`'s best friend is `i` (i.e., `i` and `p_i` form a mutual pair).
     - If such a mutual pair is found, it prints 2 and returns.
     - If no mutual pair is found, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Mutual Pair Check:**
     - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` checks if `i` and `p_i` form a mutual pair. If they do, sending invitations to both `i` and `p_i` will ensure that both come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.
     - This logic is correct for identifying mutual pairs.
   - **No Mutual Pair:**
     - If no mutual pair is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual pairs, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
     - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no mutual pairs exist, but sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. However, sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 4 will also ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is still 3.

4. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no mutual pairs but the minimum number of invitations needed is still 2. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 1]`. Here, no mutual pairs exist, but sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.
   - The program should check for the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, even if there are no mutual pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is 2 even in the absence of mutual pairs.

### Correctness: **False**
