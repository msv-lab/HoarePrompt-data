To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop will iterate over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:
1. `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.
2. `n` must be greater than `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`
- `mex` is now `n`
- `i` is `-1`
- The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

1. `i` must be initialized to `n - 1` for the loop to start correctly.
2. `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at least once.

Since `n` is already given to be greater than or equal to 1, it meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is now `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0**
