Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`n`) and the value of `p[i]` (which is `mex - a[n-1]`).
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[n-1]`.
- Therefore, `mex` is now `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
