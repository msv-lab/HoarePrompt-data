To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is still within the specified range.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`
- `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`
- `i` is `n - 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute one more time if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop will execute one more time if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, which means `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`**
