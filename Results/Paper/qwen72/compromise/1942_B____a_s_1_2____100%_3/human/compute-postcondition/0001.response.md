The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be changed to ensure the loop executes, as the given state already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**
