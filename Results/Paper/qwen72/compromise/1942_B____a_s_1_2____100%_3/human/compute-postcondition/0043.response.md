Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- The current value of `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`.
- The value of `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.
- Therefore, the new value of `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], mex - a[i])`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `p` also remains unchanged, except for the value of `mex` which is used to compute `p[i]` and `p[n-1]`.
