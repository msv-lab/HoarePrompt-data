Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[n-2]`.
- Therefore, `mex` is now `min(mex, mex - a[n-2])`.
- This simplifies to `mex` being `min(n, mex - a[n-1], mex - a[n-2])`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.
