### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - Given `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, we can rearrange this to find `p_i`:
     \[
     p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i
     \]
   - To find `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)`, we need to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the sequence `p` up to index `i`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It starts from the last element of `a` and works backwards to the first element.
   - For each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Why the Algorithm Works:**
   - By starting from the end of the array, the program ensures that the MEX calculation for each `p_i` is based on the elements that have already been placed in the permutation.
   - The `mex` variable is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible MEX for the permutation.
   - As the program iterates backwards, it correctly updates `mex` to reflect the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the sequence `p` up to the current index `i`.

5. **Validation Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:**
     - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
     - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
     - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(-n \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - **Inside the Loop:**
     - `p` is initialized to a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.
     - `mex` is initialized to `n`.
     - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
     - For each `i`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
     - `mex` is updated to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.
   - **Final State:**
     - `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` ranging from `n-1` to `0`.
     - `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`.
     - The program prints the elements of `p` for each test case.

6. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` such that the given `a` array is satisfied.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program handles multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The backward iteration ensures that the MEX calculation is based on the elements that have already been placed in the permutation, which is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
