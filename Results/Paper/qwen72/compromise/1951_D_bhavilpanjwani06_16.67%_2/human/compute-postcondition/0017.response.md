Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` and `k` are the same. If `n` is greater than `k`, then `n` is greater than `k`, and the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is preserved: if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; if `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.***
