You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def setup_store(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and n is equal to k for the current test case)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: - The value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer because `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
                #   - The value of `1` is a constant integer.
                #
                #Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.
                #
                #Output:
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then the current value of `k - 1` is less than the current value of `n - k + 1`. Otherwise, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
        #State: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` and `k` are the same. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k`, and if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
    #State: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` and `k` are the same. If `n` is greater than `k`, then `n` is greater than `k`, and the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is preserved: if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; if `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function returns the results for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided.
