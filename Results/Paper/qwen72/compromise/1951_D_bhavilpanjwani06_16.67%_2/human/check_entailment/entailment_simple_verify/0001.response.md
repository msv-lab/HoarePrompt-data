Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. This is a standard approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. This matches the problem description.

3. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n` is less than `k`. If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. In this case, the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Exact Match Check**: If `n` is exactly equal to `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up a single stall with the price `n` per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly one jewel from this stall, using all her coins. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `1` (the number of stalls) and `n` (the price of the single stall).

5. **Greedy Buying Strategy**: If `n` is greater than `k`, the program needs to determine if it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program uses the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` to decide the output. This condition can be rewritten as `2 * k - 1 < n`, which simplifies to `2 * k <= n`.

   - **Case 1**: If `2 * k <= n`, the program can set up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and another with the price `1`. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and `1` jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `2` (the number of stalls) and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.

   - **Case 2**: If `2 * k > n`, the program prints "NO" because it is not possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is because if `2 * k > n`, Alice would not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys one jewel at a time from the cheapest stalls.

6. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the required output format for both "YES" and "NO" cases. For "YES" cases, it prints the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - When `n == k`, it sets up a single stall with the price `n`.
   - When `n < k`, it correctly identifies that it is impossible.
   - When `2 * k <= n`, it sets up two stalls with appropriate prices.

8. **Constraints**: The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit. However, the program only ever sets up 1 or 2 stalls, so this constraint is always satisfied.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
