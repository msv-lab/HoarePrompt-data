Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The program only considers a maximum of 2 stalls, but the problem allows for up to 60 stalls.
2. The logic for setting up the stalls and their prices is flawed. The program does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
3. The condition `elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:` is not clear and does not seem to be derived from the problem requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, Bob needs to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible correct approach is to set up `k` stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels. If `n` is less than `k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, Bob can set up `k` stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        for i in range(k):
            print(n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0), end=' ')
        print()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This program works as follows:
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls.
- The price for each stall is calculated to ensure that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall. The price for the first `n % k` stalls is `n // k + 1`, and the price for the remaining stalls is `n // k`.

This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and does not exceed the number of stalls allowed (60).
