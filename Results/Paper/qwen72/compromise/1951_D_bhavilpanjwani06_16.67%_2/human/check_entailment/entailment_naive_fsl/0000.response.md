Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid solution when \( n \) is significantly larger than \( k \) and \( k \) is greater than 60. For example, consider the case where \( n = 1000 \) and \( k = 61 \):

- The program will output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
  However, it is possible to set up 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 61 jewels. One possible solution is to set up 60 stalls with prices \( 1, 1, 1, \ldots, 1 \) (60 times), and the remaining 1 jewel can be bought from a stall with a price of \( n - 60 \).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle this case and should be considered incorrect.
