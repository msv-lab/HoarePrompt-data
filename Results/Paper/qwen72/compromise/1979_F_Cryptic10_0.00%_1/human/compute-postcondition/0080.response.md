Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, and the `path` list now includes `v` as its last element, with `v` no longer in the `remaining_vertices` list. If `v` is not 0 and not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.***
