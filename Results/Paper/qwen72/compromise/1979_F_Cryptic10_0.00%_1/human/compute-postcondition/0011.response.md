Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list containing the value `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
