Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, with `v` as the last element of `path` and `v` no longer in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0 or was not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
