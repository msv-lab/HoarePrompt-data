The only objects in the loop head are the variable `d` and the range parameters `n - 1`, `-1`, and the step `-1`. Therefore, we can only adjust `d` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 2`. The loop is iterating in reverse, from `n - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decreased by 1 to `n - 3`, and `n` must still be a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not affected. If `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, and the `path` list now includes `v` as its last element, with `v` no longer in the `remaining_vertices` list. If `v` is not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
