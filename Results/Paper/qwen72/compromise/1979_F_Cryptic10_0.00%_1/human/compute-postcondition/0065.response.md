Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v` and `u`. The current value of `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list. `v` is appended to the `path` list.**
