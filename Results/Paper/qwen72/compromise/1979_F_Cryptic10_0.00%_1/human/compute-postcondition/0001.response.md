Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive).** 

The initial state is preserved, and the variable `remaining_vertices` is now a set containing all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
