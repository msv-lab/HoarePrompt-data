To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over the values of `d` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `d` is `n - 2`.
   - `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0.
   - `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `d`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n - 2`.
   - The loop will decrement `d` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute again if `d` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Since `d` is `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration, the loop will execute if `n - 3 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
- `d` is now `n - 3`.
- The loop will execute again if `n` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.**
