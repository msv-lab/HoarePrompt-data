Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that now contains the value `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
