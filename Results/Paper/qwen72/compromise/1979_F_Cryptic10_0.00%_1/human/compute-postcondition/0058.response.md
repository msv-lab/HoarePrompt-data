The variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element. `d` is 0**
