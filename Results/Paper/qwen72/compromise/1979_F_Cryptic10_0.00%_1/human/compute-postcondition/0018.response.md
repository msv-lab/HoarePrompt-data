Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that contains the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices` if `v` is not 0.**
