Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
