The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
