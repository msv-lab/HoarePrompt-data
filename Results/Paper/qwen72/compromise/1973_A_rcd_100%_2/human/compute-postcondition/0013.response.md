Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`, and the current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.**
