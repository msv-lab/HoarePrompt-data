Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `x` is 3, `y` is `p3 - 2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4.** 

The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so `x` is now 3. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
