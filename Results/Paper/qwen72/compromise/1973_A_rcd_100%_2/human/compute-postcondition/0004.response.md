Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
