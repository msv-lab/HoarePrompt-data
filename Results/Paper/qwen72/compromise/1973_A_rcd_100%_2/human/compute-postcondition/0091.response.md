Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2. If `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 3 and `y` is `p3 - 3` where `p3` must be at least 4.**
