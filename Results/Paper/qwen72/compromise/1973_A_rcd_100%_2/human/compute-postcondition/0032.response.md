Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If the loop condition `y >= x` is true and `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is also true, the output will be `p1 - x + p3`. If the loop condition `y >= x` is false, the output will be `p3`. The final values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented until either the loop condition `y >= x` becomes false or the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same.
- The loop will continue to increment `x` and decrement `y` until either `y` is less than `x` (in which case the loop ends and `p3` is printed), or until `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` (in which case `p1 - x + p3` is printed and the loop breaks).
- The final values of `x` and `y` will depend on when the loop breaks or ends, but they will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented in each iteration.
