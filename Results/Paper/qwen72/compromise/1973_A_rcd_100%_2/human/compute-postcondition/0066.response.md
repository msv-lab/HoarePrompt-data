The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(-1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - The relationship between these integers is `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
