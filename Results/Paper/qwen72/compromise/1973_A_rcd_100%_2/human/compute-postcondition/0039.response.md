Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(p1 + p2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are provided by user input and satisfy the conditions `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30 and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we know that `p1` and `p2` are integers within the range [1, 30].
   - The exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, but we know they are part of a set of three integers whose sum is odd.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (because the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd).

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, implying p1 + p2 is even)**
