Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is `p3 - 2` where `p3` must be at least 4.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `x` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `p1` and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p3` and both are between 1 and 30 inclusive.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, which means the sum of `p1` and `p3` must be odd because `p2` is an integer and the sum of three integers is odd if and only if the sum of two of them is odd.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 2 + p3`.
   - Since `p1` and `p3` are both integers and `p1` ≤ `p3`, the result of `p1 - 2 + p3` will be an integer.
   - The exact value of `p1 - 2 + p3` depends on the specific values of `p1` and `p3` provided by the user, but we can describe it in terms of `p1` and `p3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - 2 + p3`.
   - Given that `p1` and `p3` are integers and `p1` ≤ `p3`, the output will be an integer value.

Output: **p1 - 2 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers provided by user input, with p1 ≤ p3 and both between 1 and 30 inclusive, and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
