The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `p_2` is an integer such that `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `p_3` is an integer such that `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
