Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 3 and `y` is `p3 - 3`.**
