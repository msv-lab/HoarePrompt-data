Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the total points are even and then trying to find the maximum number of draws. However, there are some logical issues in the approach:

1. **Even Total Points Check**:
   - The condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` correctly identifies that if the total points are odd, the scores are invalid because each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) always results in an even number of points being distributed.

2. **Case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, then the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score can only be achieved by winning all non-draw games, and the remaining points can be distributed as draws.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program uses a while loop to try to find a valid distribution of draws. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - The condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y` is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of draws. It only checks if the remaining points after `x` and `y` draws can be valid, but it doesn't correctly account for the total number of draws.
     - The loop should be designed to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed in a valid way.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Check if the total points are even**:
   - If `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`, print `-1`.

2. **Check if the scores can be achieved**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            print((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Even Total Points Check**:
  - If the total points are odd, print `-1`.

- **Case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
  - If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, print `p1 + p2`.

- **General Case**:
  - Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is calculated as `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3`. This formula ensures that the remaining points after accounting for the maximum number of draws can be distributed in a valid way.

This corrected program should correctly determine the maximum number of draws or identify if the scores are invalid.
