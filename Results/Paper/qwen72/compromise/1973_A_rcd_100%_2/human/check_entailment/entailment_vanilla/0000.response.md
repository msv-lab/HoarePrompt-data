### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total score must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (for a win/loss) or 2 points (for a draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Score Consistency Check**:
   - The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This check is correct because if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score can be achieved by winning all non-draw games, and the other two players can only get points from draws.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws**:
   - If the above condition is not met, the program initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`.
   - It then enters a while loop where it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The loop increments `x` and decrements `y` until `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

5. **Validation of the Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the scores of `p1` and `p3` while ensuring that the scores remain consistent.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining score of `p1` after `x` draws is less than or equal to the remaining score of `p2` after `y` draws. This is necessary to ensure that the scores can be achieved with the given number of draws.
   - If the loop finds a valid solution, it prints the maximum number of draws. If not, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the total score check and the score consistency check.
- The loop logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws, and it appears to be correctly implemented to ensure that the scores remain consistent.
- The program prints the correct output for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
