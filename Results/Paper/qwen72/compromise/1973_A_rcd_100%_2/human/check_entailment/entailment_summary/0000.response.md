Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If the sum of the scores is odd, it is impossible for the scores to be valid because each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) must result in an even total score change. Therefore, printing -1 in this case is correct.

2. **Score Inequality Check**: The program also correctly checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2` (the two lower scores). If `p3` is at least as large as `p1 + p2`, it means that the third player could have won all the games against the other two players, and the maximum number of draws that could have happened is `p1 + p2` (since each draw adds 1 point to both players, and the third player could have drawn with the other two).

3. **Finding the Maximum Draws**: If the above conditions are not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop iterates while `y` (starting from `p3`) is greater than or equal to `x` (starting from 0). The loop checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws. If the loop completes without finding such a point, it prints `p3`.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic is designed to find a balance where the difference in scores between the first and second players is minimized, which is a valid approach to maximize the number of draws. However, the loop logic is a bit complex and could be simplified.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when no games were played (`0 0 0`), and when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (`1 1 1`).

6. **Simplification**: The loop logic can be simplified to directly calculate the maximum number of draws. The maximum number of draws can be found by ensuring that the difference in scores between the players is minimized, and the total number of points is even.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and handles the problem as described. However, the loop logic can be simplified for clarity.

Correctness: **True**

Here is a simplified version of the program for clarity:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            draws = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3
            print(draws)
```

This simplified version directly calculates the maximum number of draws without the need for a loop, making it easier to understand and verify.
