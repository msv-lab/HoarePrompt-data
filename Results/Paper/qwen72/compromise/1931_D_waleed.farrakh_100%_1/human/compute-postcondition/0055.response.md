Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
