Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes the dictionary `freq` to an empty dictionary.
- Since no operations are performed on `freq` in the given code snippet, it remains an empty dictionary.
- The initial state variables `test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results`, and `arr` are not modified by the code.
- The variable `count` is not modified by the code, so it remains 0.
- All other information from the initial state remains valid.
