Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is 0, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, and the pair `(rx, ry)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`.**
