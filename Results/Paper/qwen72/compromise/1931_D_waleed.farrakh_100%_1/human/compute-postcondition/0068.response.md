Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`) is already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1. `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`. `count` remains unchanged.***
