Output State: **The function `func_2` now has a reference to the standard input through the variable `input`. No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, and the function is ready to read input in the specified format.**

Explanation: The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the method `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This means that the function `func_2` can now use `input` to read from the standard input. The initial state indicates that no variables are passed to `func_2`, and the function is expecting a specific format of input. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not yet defined, but the function is now prepared to read and process the input as described.
