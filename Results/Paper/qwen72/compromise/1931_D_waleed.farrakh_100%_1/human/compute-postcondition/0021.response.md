Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 7 + 2 * (t - 3), `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.** 

The initial state variables `t`, `idx`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The new variable `results` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.
