Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
- The values of `rx` and `ry` are calculated based on the second element `a` of the array `arr` from the second tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The only change is in the value of `count`, which is now increased by the value found in the dictionary `freq` at the key `(rx, ry)`.
