Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, where `a` is the first element in `arr` and `y` is the third element in the second tuple of `test_cases`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
