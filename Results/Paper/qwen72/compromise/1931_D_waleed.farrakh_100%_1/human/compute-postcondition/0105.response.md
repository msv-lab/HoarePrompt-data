Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair encountered in `arr`, and `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list.
- The value of `count` itself does not change.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, and `freq`) remain unchanged.
