Output State: **`count` is updated to the previous value of `count` plus `freq[rx, ry]`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` includes the key `(a % x, a % y)` with a value of `freq[rx, ry] + 1` if `current_pair` was already in `freq`, otherwise `freq` includes the key `(a % x, a % y)` with a value of 1.**
