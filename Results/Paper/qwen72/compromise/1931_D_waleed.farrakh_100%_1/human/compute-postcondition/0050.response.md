Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to `freq[rx, ry]`, where `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1, and `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`, or is updated to `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`. `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of `a % y`.***
