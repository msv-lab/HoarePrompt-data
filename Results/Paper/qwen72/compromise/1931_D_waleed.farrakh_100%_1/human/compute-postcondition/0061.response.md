Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` updates the value of `rx`.
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the third element of `arr` (denoted as `a`), and the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` (denoted as `x`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
