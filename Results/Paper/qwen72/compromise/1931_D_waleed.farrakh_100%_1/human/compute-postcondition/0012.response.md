Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 3, `test_cases` is a list containing a single tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[4]`.**

The value of `arr` is updated to a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
