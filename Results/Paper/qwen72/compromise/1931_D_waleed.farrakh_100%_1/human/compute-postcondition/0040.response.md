Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements and must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `rx` using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- `a` is the first element in `arr`.
- `x` is the second element in the second tuple of `test_cases`.
- The value of `rx` is computed based on the values of `a` and `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
