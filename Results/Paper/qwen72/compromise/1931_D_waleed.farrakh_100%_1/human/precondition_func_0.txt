test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), y (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and arr (a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and len(arr) = n). The length of test_cases is at most 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
