### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes it to create a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The input is read line by line, and the test cases are appended to the `test_cases` list. This part of the function correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes a list of test cases and processes each one to find the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases with `func_1`, `func_2` prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by using the properties of modular arithmetic.
  - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the sum of the pair is divisible by `x`.
  - The use of `a % y` ensures that the difference of the pair is divisible by `y`.
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count the pairs without needing to compare every pair of elements in the array, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes it to create the test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.
  - The input and output handling is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Both functions work together to handle the input, process the test cases, and produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
