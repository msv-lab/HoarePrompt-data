You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It then iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element `a`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to handle negative remainders.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the results list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into lines.
   - It parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that the pairs are counted only if both conditions are met, and it efficiently uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the pairs, which helps in reducing the time complexity. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
