The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range limit, which is 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than 2.

State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[]`.**
