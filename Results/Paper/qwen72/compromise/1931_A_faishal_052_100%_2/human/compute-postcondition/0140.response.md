Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `lex` is the last input integer processed.
- `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs.
- `temp` is the string formed by converting the integers `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` to their corresponding lowercase letters.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(temp)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `info`**:
   - `info` is a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to one of the `cases` inputs.
   - Since `cases` is greater than 0, `info` must contain at least one list.

2. **Accessing `info[0]`**:
   - `info[0]` is the first list in `info`.
   - This list contains integers, and we need to convert the first three elements of this list (`info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]`) to their corresponding lowercase letters.

3. **Converting Integers to Lowercase Letters**:
   - In Python, the function `chr(97 + n)` can be used to convert an integer `n` to its corresponding lowercase letter. For example, `chr(97 + 0)` gives 'a', `chr(97 + 1)` gives 'b', and so on.
   - Therefore, `info[0][0]` will be converted to `chr(97 + info[0][0])`, `info[0][1]` to `chr(97 + info[0][1])`, and `info[0][2]` to `chr(97 + info[0][2])`.

4. **Forming `temp`**:
   - `temp` is the string formed by concatenating these three characters.
   - For example, if `info[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]`, then `temp` would be `'abc'`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by converting the integers info[0][0], info[0][1], and info[0][2] to their corresponding lowercase letters)**
