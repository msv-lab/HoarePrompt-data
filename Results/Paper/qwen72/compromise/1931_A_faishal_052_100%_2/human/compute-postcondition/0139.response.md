Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the string formed by converting the integers `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` to their corresponding lowercase letters.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs 3 times, from `j = 0` to `j = 2`.
- In each iteration, the character corresponding to the integer at `info[0][j]` (converted to a lowercase letter) is appended to `temp`.
- After 3 iterations, `temp` will contain the characters corresponding to `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` concatenated together.
- The value of `j` is 3 after the loop finishes.
- The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
