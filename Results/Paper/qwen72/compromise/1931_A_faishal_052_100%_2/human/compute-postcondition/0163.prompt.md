You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` will have its original value (as it is not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification), and `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as follows: For each input `lex`, if `lex` is less than 28, the list will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list will be `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` remains unchanged, `i` equals `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` is 3 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` is the last input integer processed, and `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs. The structure of each list in `info` is determined by the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, the list is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list is `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `t` from stdin, representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and returns the decoded word corresponding to each `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
