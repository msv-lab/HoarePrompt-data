The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range specified (which is 3). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 3.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][1] + 96`.**
