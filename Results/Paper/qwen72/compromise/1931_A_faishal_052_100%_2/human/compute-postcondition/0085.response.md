Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `arr` (which contains the value of `lex`) to the list `info`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged. The new state of `info` includes the original sublist and the appended `arr`.
