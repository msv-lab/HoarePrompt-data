The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `cases` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`**
