The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state defines the structure of `arr` based on the value of `lex`. Let's consider each case:

1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`. Sorting this list will not change its order since all elements are already in ascending order.

2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1, 1, lex - 27]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`.

3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Sorting this list will not change its order since all elements are already in ascending order.

4. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Sorting this list will not change its order since all elements are already in ascending order.

Therefore, the output state is:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` remains `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` remains `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1, 1, 1, `lex - 3`]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 27`, 26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is [26, 26, 26, `lex - 78`].**
