The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the current value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Let's consider the different cases for `lex` and their impact on `arr`:

1. **If `lex` was initially less than 28:**
   - `lex` is now `lex - 2`.
   - `info` is updated to `[[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]]`.
   - `arr` is set to `[1, 1]`.
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.

2. **If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive):**
   - `lex` is now `lex - 52`.
   - `info` is updated to `[[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]]`.
   - `arr` is set to `[26, 26]`.
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.

3. **If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive):**
   - `lex` is now `lex - 52`.
   - `info` is updated to `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`.
   - `arr` is set to `[26, 26]`.
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.

4. **If `lex` was initially greater than 78:**
   - `lex` remains unchanged.
   - `info` is updated to `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`.
   - `arr` remains an empty list.
   - After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes `[lex]`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will depend on the initial value of `lex`. Here are the possible output states:

- If `lex` was initially less than 28:
  - `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 2`, `info` is `[[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]]`, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
  - Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 2`, `info` is `[[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]]`, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`**

- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive):
  - `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 52`, `info` is `[[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]]`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
  - Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 52`, `info` is `[[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]]`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`**

- If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive):
  - `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 52`, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
  - Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 52`, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`**

- If `lex` was initially greater than 78:
  - `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`.
  - Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`**
