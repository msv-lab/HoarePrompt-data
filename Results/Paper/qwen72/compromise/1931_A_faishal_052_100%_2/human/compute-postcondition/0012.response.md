Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing [26], `lex` is an input integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive), `j` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- Given that the initial value of `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value for `lex` that is between 2 and 26 (inclusive).
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
