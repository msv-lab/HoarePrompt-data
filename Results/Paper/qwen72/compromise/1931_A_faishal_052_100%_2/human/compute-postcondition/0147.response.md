The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 3 in this case. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 3.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96` and `info[1][1] + 96`.**
