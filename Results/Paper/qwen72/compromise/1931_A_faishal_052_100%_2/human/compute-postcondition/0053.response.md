Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], `arr` is [26].** 

The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
