The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state, `arr` is `[lex]`, which contains a single element `lex`. Sorting a list with a single element does not change its order.

Therefore, the output state is: `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`.**
