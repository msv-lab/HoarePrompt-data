Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value. If `lex` is initially less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is initially between 28 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is initially greater than 78, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` is unchanged.***
