The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The value of `arr` is modified by appending `26` to it.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.
- The value of `info` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78.
- If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1].
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26].
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26].
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list.
- In all cases, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.

After executing the code snippet `arr.append(26)`, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` remains the same, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` was less than 28, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex` was between 28 and 78, and `arr` is [26] if `lex` was greater than 78.**
