Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing [26], `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, and the current value of `lex` is less than 52.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was an empty list, so after executing the code, `arr` contains the single element 26. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `lex`, `j`) remain unchanged, and their initial conditions still hold true.
