Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `cases` remains unchanged, `i` equals `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` is 3 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` is the last input integer processed, and `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs. The structure of each list in `info` is determined by the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, the list is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list is `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`.**
