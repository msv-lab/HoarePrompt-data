Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `cases` will have its original value (as it is not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification), and `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as follows: For each input `lex`, if `lex` is less than 28, the list will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list will be `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order.**
