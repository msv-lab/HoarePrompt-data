Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer and its current value is less than 27, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]`, `arr` is `[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, making its new value one less than its original value, which was already less than 28. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `info` list is updated to reflect the new value of `lex` in the second sublist.
