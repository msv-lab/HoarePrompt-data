Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it. If `lex` > 78, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
