Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is [26].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it. If `lex` > 78, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
