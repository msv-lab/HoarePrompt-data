You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and processes it to generate a list of integers based on specific conditions. It then sorts these lists and constructs a string from the first three elements of each list by converting them to their corresponding lowercase letters (using ASCII values). Finally, it prints these strings to standard output, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose letter indices sum up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The goal is to find the smallest possible combination of three letters that sum to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded value.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.
   - It then tries to fill `arr` with the largest possible values first, ensuring the sum of the indices equals `lex`.

3. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After filling `arr` with two values, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - Finally, it converts the indices in `arr` to characters and prints the resulting word.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The logic for handling the cases where `lex` is less than 28, between 28 and 52, and between 52 and 78 is not optimal.
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge cases and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly append 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22 in the correct order.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by trying to use the smallest possible values for the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
   - We can use a loop to try different combinations and ensure the sum is correct while maintaining the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
