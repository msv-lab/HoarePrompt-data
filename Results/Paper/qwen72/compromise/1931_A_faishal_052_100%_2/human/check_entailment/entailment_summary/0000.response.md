Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`. The approach taken in the program involves breaking down the integer into three parts, which represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet. However, there are some issues with the logic used to achieve this:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to handle the lexicographical order by sorting the array `arr` after filling it with the positions of the letters. This approach is flawed because the order in which the positions are added to `arr` should reflect the lexicographical order directly, without needing to sort the array at the end.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Assigning Positions**: The logic for assigning positions to the letters is not consistent with the requirement to find the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the conditions `if lex < 28`, `elif lex < 52`, and `elif lex <= 78` do not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value of `lex` to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `lex` is very small (e.g., 3) or very large (e.g., 78).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Adjust the third letter to ensure the sum equals the given `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the positions of the three letters
        a, b, c = 1, 1, n - 2
        # Ensure the positions are valid and lexicographically smallest
        while c > 26:
            c -= 25
            b += 1
        while b > 26:
            b -= 25
            a += 1
        # Convert positions to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the positions of the letters are adjusted to be within the valid range (1 to 26) and that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
