### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The sum of the first `b - a` terms is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining buns is \(a \cdot (n - (b - a))\).
     - Therefore, the total profit is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` and where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - The program also correctly calculates the profit when `b - a` is less than `n`.

5. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The program uses integer division (`//`) and type casting (`int()`) to ensure the results are integers, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases, and the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
