Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage. The profit is simply `n * a`.
     - This condition is correctly handled.

   - **Case 2**: `elif b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is \((2b - n + 1) \cdot n // 2\).
     - This condition is correctly handled.

   - **Case 3**: `else`
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \((b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1) // 2\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - This condition is also correctly handled.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` and where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - The arithmetic calculations are performed using integer division, which is appropriate for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
