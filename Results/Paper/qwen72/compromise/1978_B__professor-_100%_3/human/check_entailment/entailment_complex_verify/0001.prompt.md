You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b are unchanged, but the loop has printed the results of the calculations for each test case according to the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b <= a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` if `b - a >= n`, or `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage. The profit is simply `n * a`.
     - This condition is correctly handled.

   - **Case 2**: `elif b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is \((2b - n + 1) \cdot n // 2\).
     - This condition is correctly handled.

   - **Case 3**: `else`
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \((b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1) // 2\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - This condition is also correctly handled.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` and where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - The arithmetic calculations are performed using integer division, which is appropriate for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
