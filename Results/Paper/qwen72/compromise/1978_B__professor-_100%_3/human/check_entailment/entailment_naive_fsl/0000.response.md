Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Case when `b <= a`**:
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
   - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.

2. **Case when `b - a >= n`**:
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula \((2b - n + 1) \cdot n // 2\).
   - The program correctly prints this value.

3. **Case when `b - a < n`**:
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula \((b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1) // 2\).
   - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
   - The program correctly prints this value.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it always calculates the maximum profit correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
