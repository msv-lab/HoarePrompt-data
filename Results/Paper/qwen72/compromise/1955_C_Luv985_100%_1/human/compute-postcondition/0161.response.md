Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0 or 1. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.***
