Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The other variables (`r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[0]`, `a[r]`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
