Output State: **`l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `l` was 1, it becomes 2.
- The values of `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `mi`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
