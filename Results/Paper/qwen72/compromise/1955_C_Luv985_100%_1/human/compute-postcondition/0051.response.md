Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[l]` is decremented by `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `mi` are not changed, except for the update to `a[l]`.
- The new value of `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.
