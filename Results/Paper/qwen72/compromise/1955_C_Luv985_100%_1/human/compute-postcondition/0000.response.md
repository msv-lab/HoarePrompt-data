The provided code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, it does not change the state of any variables or the program's execution flow.

Output State: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of pairs (n, k), and a list of lists a. t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each pair (n, k) in the list of pairs consists of integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively. Each list in a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists a should be equal to t. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
