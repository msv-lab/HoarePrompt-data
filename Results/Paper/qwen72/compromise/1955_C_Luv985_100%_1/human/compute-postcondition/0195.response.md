Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (if `a[r]` was 0, `r` becomes `n - 2` or `n - 3`), `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` (if `a[r]` was 0, `a[r]` remains 0). `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[r]` was 0 and `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.***
