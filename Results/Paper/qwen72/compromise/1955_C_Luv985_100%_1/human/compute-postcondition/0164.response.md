Postcondition: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`. Additionally, the current value of `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0.**
