Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `ans` is 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value.
- All other variables (`l`, `r`, `ans`, `T`, `a`, `mi`) remain unchanged, but the values of `a[0]` and `a[r]` have already been modified by subtracting `mi` from them in the initial state.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `a`, and `mi` are still valid.
