You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

For each test case, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`, and `k` is 0 or less than 2. `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop execution, plus 1 if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. The list `a` is modified such that elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a` representing the durability of `n` ships. The function then processes the list `a` by reducing the durability of the ships at the ends of the list, aiming to reduce as many ships to 0 durability as possible using up to `k` attacks. The function prints the number of ships that have been reduced to 0 durability for each test case. After processing all test cases, `T` is 0, and the list `a` for each test case is modified such that the elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks a ship that has already sunk. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the indices `l` and `r` when a ship sinks, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

The expected output is `2`, but the program will produce an incorrect result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the program:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
   - `l = 0`, `r = 3`
   - `k = 5`

2. **First Attack:**
   - `a[l] = 1`, `a[r] = 3`
   - `mi = min(1, 3) = 1`
   - `a[l] -= 1` -> `a[l] = 0`
   - `a[r] -= 1` -> `a[r] = 2`
   - `k -= 2` -> `k = 3`
   - `ans += 1` -> `ans = 1`
   - `l += 1` -> `l = 1`

3. **Second Attack:**
   - `a[l] = 2`, `a[r] = 2`
   - `mi = min(2, 2) = 2`
   - `a[l] -= 2` -> `a[l] = 0`
   - `a[r] -= 2` -> `a[r] = 0`
   - `k -= 4` -> `k = -1` (This is incorrect because `k` should not be negative)
   - `ans += 2` -> `ans = 3`
   - `l += 1` -> `l = 2`
   - `r -= 1` -> `r = 1`

4. **Third Attack:**
   - The loop condition `l < r` is no longer true, so the loop exits.
   - The program then checks `if l == r` and adds `ans += k >= a[l]` -> `ans += -1 >= 0` (which is false, so `ans` remains 3)
   - The program prints `3`, which is incorrect.

The correct output should be `2` because the first and last ships are sunk, and the remaining ships are `[2, 2]` with `k = 3` left, which is not enough to sink any more ships.

The program fails to correctly handle the case where `k` is reduced to a negative value, and it does not correctly manage the indices when ships are sunk. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
