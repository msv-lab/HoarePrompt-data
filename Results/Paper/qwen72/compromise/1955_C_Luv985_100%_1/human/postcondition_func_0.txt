The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a` representing the durability of `n` ships. The function then processes the list `a` by reducing the durability of the ships at the ends of the list, aiming to reduce as many ships to 0 durability as possible using up to `k` attacks. The function prints the number of ships that have been reduced to 0 durability for each test case. After processing all test cases, `T` is 0, and the list `a` for each test case is modified such that the elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero.
