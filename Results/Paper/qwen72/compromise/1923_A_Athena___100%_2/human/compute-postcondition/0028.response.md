Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` (the third element of `a`) is 0, `res` is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
