The first element of the list `a` is removed using the `pop(0)` method. Since the first element of `a` was 0, the list `a` now starts with the second element it originally had. The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`, which is one less than its previous value. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (one less than the initial value), `res` is 0**
