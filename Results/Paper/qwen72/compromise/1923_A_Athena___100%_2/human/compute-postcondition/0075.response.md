The last element of `a` is removed using `a.pop()`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed, and the new last element of `a` will be the second-to-last element of the initial `a`. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 1`, so after removing the last element, `i` is now `len(a) - 2` (or -1 if `a` becomes empty after the removal). The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is now the second-to-last element of the initial `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (or -1 if `a` becomes empty), `res` is 0, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer.**
