The first element of the list `a` is removed. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed and the new first element is 0, after this operation, the new first element of `a` will be the element that was originally the second element of `a`. The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` which was `len(a) - 1` is now `len(a) - 2`. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `res` is 0, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer.**
