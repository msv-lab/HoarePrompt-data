The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `res` is 0**
