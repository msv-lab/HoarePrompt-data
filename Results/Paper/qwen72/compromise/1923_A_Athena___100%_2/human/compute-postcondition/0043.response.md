Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (where `a` is the list after all leading zeros have been removed and the last element has been removed), `res` is 0, and `a[-1]` is no longer 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`.
- Since `a[-1]` was 0, after `a.pop()`, `a[-1]` is no longer 0.
- The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` which was `len(a) - 1` is now `len(a) - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`) remain unchanged.
