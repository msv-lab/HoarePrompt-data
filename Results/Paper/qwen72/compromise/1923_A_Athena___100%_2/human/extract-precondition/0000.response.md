Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1) where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines as described. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**
