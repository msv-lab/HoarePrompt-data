Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips with free cells between them. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not always the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
The output of the program would be `4`, but the correct output should be `3`. The optimal solution would be to move the chips as follows:
1. Move the chip at position 2 to position 1.
2. Move the chip at position 4 to position 3.
3. Move the chip at position 6 to position 5.

This results in the chips being at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7, forming a single block with the minimum number of operations. The program, however, counts all zeros between the first and last chip, leading to an incorrect result.
