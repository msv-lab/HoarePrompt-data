You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) that are not at the beginning or end of the list after removing any leading and trailing free cells. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` and `a` holding the values from the last test case, and `res` being the number of free cells in the last processed list `a` after the specified removal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.

2. **Trimming the List**:
   - The program trims the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done using two `while` loops:
     - The first loop removes leading zeros (`while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`).
     - The second loop removes trailing zeros (`while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`).
   - This step ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips and is not surrounded by free cells.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) within the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.
   - This is done using a `for` loop that iterates through the trimmed list and increments `res` for each `0` encountered.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which is the number of free cells within the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Goal**: The goal is to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
- **Strategy**: The strategy used in the program is to count the number of free cells within the segment of the ribbon that contains chips. This count represents the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single block.
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains chips by removing leading and trailing zeros.
  - The number of free cells within this segment is indeed the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single block.
  - This is because each free cell within the segment represents a chip that needs to be moved to fill the gap, and the program counts these gaps accurately.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Free cells within the segment: `1`
  - Minimum moves: `1`
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After trimming: `1`
  - Free cells within the segment: `0`
  - Minimum moves: `0`
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Free cells within the segment: `0`
  - Minimum moves: `0`
- **Test Case 4**: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Free cells within the segment: `2`
  - Minimum moves: `2`
- **Test Case 5**: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Free cells within the segment: `3`
  - Minimum moves: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It accurately counts the number of free cells within the segment of the ribbon that contains chips, which is the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

### Correctness:
**True**
