Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Trimming Free Cells**: For each test case, it trims the leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list `a`. This step is crucial because the chips can only move to the left, and the leading and trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
3. **Counting Free Cells**: After trimming, the program counts the number of free cells (0s) within the remaining list. Each free cell represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip to the left, so the number of free cells is the minimum number of operations required.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements, and it handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when all chips are already in a single block or when there are no free cells between the chips. Therefore, the program is correct.
