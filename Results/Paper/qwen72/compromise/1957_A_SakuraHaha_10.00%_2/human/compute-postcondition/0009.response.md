The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 100.
- `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n` integers representing stick lengths. Each stick length `a_i` is an integer with the constraint 1 <= a_i <= 100.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of sticks in each test case, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case:
- If the sum of the stick lengths in the test case is even, the function returns "Yes" for that test case.
- If the sum of the stick lengths in the test case is odd, the function returns "No" for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (number of test cases), a list of lists `a` (stick lengths for each test case), and an integer `n` (number of sticks per test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the sum of stick lengths in the corresponding test case is even, and "No" if the sum is odd.**
