The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the result of some operation involving `a` and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The function returns the result of an operation involving `a` and `b` for each test case.**
