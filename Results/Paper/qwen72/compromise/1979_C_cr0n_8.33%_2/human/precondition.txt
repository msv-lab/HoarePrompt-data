The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should output the results to stdout, either -1 if no solution exists, or n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
