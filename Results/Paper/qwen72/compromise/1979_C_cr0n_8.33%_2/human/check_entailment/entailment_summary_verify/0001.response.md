### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **Solution Approach:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then computes the values `vprod` such that each `vprod[i]` is `prod // vals[i]`.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `prod` to get `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values of `vprod`.

3. **Mathematical Validity:**
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers `prod` and divides it by each multiplier to get the bet amounts `vprod`.
   - The sum of `vprod` should be less than `prod` to ensure the condition is met.
   - If `prod - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total bet amount is not strictly less than any possible winning amount, and thus no valid solution exists.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid solution exists by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where a valid solution exists by printing the bet amounts.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the bet amounts `x_i` are within the range `1 <= x_i <= 10^9` as required by the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of `prod` Calculation:**
  - The product `prod` is calculated by multiplying all elements in `vals`. This is correct and ensures that `prod` is a large number that can be divided by each `vals[i]` to get a non-zero integer.

- **Correctness of `vprod` Calculation:**
  - Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `prod // vals[i]`. This ensures that the bet amount for each outcome is a valid integer and is proportional to the product of the other multipliers.

- **Correctness of `den` Calculation:**
  - The value `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This is the key check to ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
  - If `den <= 0`, it means the total bet amount is not strictly less than any possible winning amount, and thus no valid solution exists. This is correctly handled by printing `-1`.

- **Output Validation:**
  - If `den > 0`, the program prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. This ensures that the bet amounts are valid and meet the problem's constraints.

### Potential Issues:

- **Overflow:**
  - The product `prod` can become very large, especially when `N` is large and the multipliers are close to the upper limit (20). However, Python's integer type can handle arbitrarily large numbers, so this is not a practical issue in this context.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program calculates `prod` and `vprod` in a straightforward manner, which is efficient for the given constraints (1 <= n <= 50 and 2 <= k_i <= 20).

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the bet amounts for each outcome. It handles the edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. The mathematical approach used is valid and ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
