The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The initial state of `data`, `index`, and `results` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
