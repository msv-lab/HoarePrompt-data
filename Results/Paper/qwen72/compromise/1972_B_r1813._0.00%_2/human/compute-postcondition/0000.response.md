Output State: **The function is now set to read input from `sys.stdin`, but no actual input has been read or processed yet. The initial state of the function parameters `t` and the list of tuples remains unchanged.**

Natural language description: The code snippet assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`, which means the function is now ready to read input from the standard input stream. However, since the input has not actually been read or processed, the values of the function parameters `t` and the list of tuples remain as they were initially provided.
