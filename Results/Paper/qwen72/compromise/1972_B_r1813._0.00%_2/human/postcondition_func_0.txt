The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd and appends 'YES' to the results list if it is, otherwise appends 'NO'. Finally, the function prints each element of the results list, which contains `t` elements, each being 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
