### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly identifies the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the count of facing-up coins is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, and the program appends `'YES'` to the `results` list.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program appends `'NO'` to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The key insight is that the game is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move when it's his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (`num_up_coins == 0`), which results in a loss for the player whose turn it is.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which results in no flips and the game ending.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
