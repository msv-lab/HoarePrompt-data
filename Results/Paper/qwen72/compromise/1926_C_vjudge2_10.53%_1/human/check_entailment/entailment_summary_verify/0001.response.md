### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case, storing them in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. Both lists are initialized to the size of `max(numbers) + 1`.

3. **Sum of Digits for 1 to 9:**
   - The program correctly sets the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 and updates the cumulative sum for these numbers.

4. **Sum of Digits for 10 and Above:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the program converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder.
   - It then calculates the sum of digits for the current number `i` by adding the sum of the last digit and the sum of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum for the current number `i` is updated by adding the sum of digits of `i` to the cumulative sum of the previous number `i - 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits for the given `n`.

### Issues:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The original program calculates the sum of digits and cumulative sums for all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases, which is inefficient. This can lead to performance issues, especially given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
  - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1)` is executed for each test case, which is unnecessary. The sums should be precomputed once and reused for all test cases.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 10 correctly. It should precompute the sums for all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases, not just up to the current `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To address the efficiency issue, we can precompute the sum of digits and cumulative sums for all numbers up to the maximum possible `n` (200,000) once and then use these precomputed values for each test case.

```python
def precompute_sums(max_n):
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        total += values[i]
        sum_values[i] = total
    return sum_values

def func_1():
    max_n = 2 * 10**5
    sum_values = precompute_sums(max_n)
    
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** due to its inefficiency and the way it handles the precomputation of sums for each test case.
- The corrected program is **correct** and efficient, as it precomputes the sums once and reuses them for all test cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
