Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads all test cases into a list `numbers` before processing them. This is not necessary and can be optimized by processing each test case as it is read.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Digit Sums:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of digits for each number from 10 to `n` using a string conversion and indexing approach, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results. For example, the calculation of `remainder` by slicing the string and converting it back to an integer is not the correct way to handle the sum of digits.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses a variable `sum_total` to calculate the sum of values, but it should be `sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]` to correctly accumulate the sum of digit sums.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot t)\), which is too high given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). The program will likely exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem efficiently, you can precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to the maximum possible value (200,000) and then use this precomputed array to answer each test case in constant time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def precompute_sums(max_n):
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum_of_digits(i)
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    return sum_values

def func_1():
    max_n = 2 * 10**5
    sum_values = precompute_sums(max_n)
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`sum_of_digits(n)`:** This function calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`.
2. **`precompute_sums(max_n)`:** This function precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `max_n` and stores them in the `sum_values` array.
3. **`func_1()`:** This function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and prints the precomputed sum of digit sums for `n`.

This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given time constraints.
