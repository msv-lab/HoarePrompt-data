### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order.
- The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is the length of the substring.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the string and stores it in `zeroes`.

3. **Calculating Cost:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is '0', it adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one '1' encountered before (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If `c` is '1', it adds the number of '0's that have not been counted yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case by reading the binary string and calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.
- The function ensures that the cost is calculated correctly by considering the number of '0's that come after each '1'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the string is already sorted.
- However, the program does handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. For a string like "0000", the program will not add any cost because there are no '1's in the string, and thus `ans` will remain 0.

#### Verification:
- Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
  - For "10": The program will calculate `ans = 2` (one '1' followed by one '0').
  - For "0000": The program will calculate `ans = 0` (no '1's, so no cost).
  - For "11000": The program will calculate `ans = 9` (three '1's followed by three '0's).
  - For "101011": The program will calculate `ans = 5` (correctly handling the positions of '0's and '1's).
  - For "01101001": The program will calculate `ans = 11` (correctly handling the positions of '0's and '1's).

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles all the test cases and meets the problem requirements.
- The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
