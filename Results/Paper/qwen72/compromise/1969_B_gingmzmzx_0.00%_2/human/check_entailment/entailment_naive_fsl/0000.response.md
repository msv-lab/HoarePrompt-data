Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, consider the input "0000". According to the problem description, the output should be 0 since the string is already sorted. However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate a non-zero cost because it always adds to `ans` whenever it encounters a '0' after a '1', which is unnecessary in this case. This means the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
