Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list of integers representing the digits of the binary string. It remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list itself.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`zeroes`**: The count of zeros in the list `s`. It remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the total number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the total number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is calculated based on the logic inside the loop. For each 0 encountered, `ans` is incremented by 1 if there are any 1s before it. For each 1 encountered, `ans` is incremented by the total number of zeros minus the number of 0s encountered so far. Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.
