The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be incremented or set to a value greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.**
