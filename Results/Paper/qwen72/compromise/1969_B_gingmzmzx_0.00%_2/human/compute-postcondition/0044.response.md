Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes + 1`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.*** 

(Note: The postcondition is simplified to reflect the final state of `ans` based on the value of `c`.)

For clarity, the final postcondition can be summarized as:
- If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`.
- If `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes + 1` or `2 * zeroes` depending on the specific logic applied in the else part. However, since `c` is 1 in the else part, the correct value of `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.
