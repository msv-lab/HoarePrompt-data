To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of a new input binary string.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is computed as follows:
     - For each 1 in the list `s`, calculate the product of the total number of 1s in `s` and the total number of zeros in `s`.
     - Subtract the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1 from this product.
     - Sum these values for all 1s in the list `s`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the number of 0s in `s` as `zeroes` and the number of 1s in `s` as `ones`.
   - For each 1 in `s`, the contribution to `ans` is:
     \[
     \text{contribution} = \text{ones} \times (\text{zeroes} - \text{cumulative\_zeroes})
     \]
     where `cumulative_zeroes` is the number of 0s encountered before the current 1.
   - Sum these contributions for all 1s in `s`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
   - `zeroes = 2` (count of 0s in `s`).
   - `ones = 3` (count of 1s in `s`).
   - Calculate `ans`:
     - First 1: `cumulative_zeroes = 0`, contribution = \(3 \times (2 - 0) = 6\).
     - Second 1: `cumulative_zeroes = 1`, contribution = \(3 \times (2 - 1) = 3\).
     - Third 1: `cumulative_zeroes = 2`, contribution = \(3 \times (2 - 2) = 0\).
     - Sum of contributions: \(6 + 3 + 0 = 9\).

Therefore, the value of `ans` is 9 for this example.

5. **General Case:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `zeroes` and `ones` and the positions of 1s in the list `s`.
   - Without the exact values of `s`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the given variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 1s in s multiplied by the total number of zeros in s minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1)**
