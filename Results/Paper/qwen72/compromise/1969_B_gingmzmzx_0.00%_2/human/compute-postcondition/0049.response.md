Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [3, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if `c` is 1, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes + 1`. If `c` is 0 (in the else part), `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 5`. If `c` is 1 (in the else part), `ans` is `3 * zeroes`.***
