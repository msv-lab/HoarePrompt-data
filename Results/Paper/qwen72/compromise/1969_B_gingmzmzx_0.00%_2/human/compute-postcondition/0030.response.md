Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`, which means the count of zeros and ones in the list `s` is now reset to zero. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
