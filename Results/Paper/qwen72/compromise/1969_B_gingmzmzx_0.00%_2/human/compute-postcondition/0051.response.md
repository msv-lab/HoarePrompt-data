To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of a new input binary string.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of 1s in `s`.
   - `ans` is calculated as follows:
     - For each 1 in `s`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`.
     - For each 0 in `s` that has at least one 1 before it, add 1 to `ans`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `zeroes - cnt[0]` is always 0 because `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` are the same (both represent the count of zeros in `s`).
   - Therefore, for each 1 in `s`, the term `zeroes - cnt[0]` contributes 0 to `ans`.
   - For each 0 in `s` that has at least one 1 before it, add 1 to `ans`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since `zeroes - cnt[0]` is always 0, the contribution from each 1 in `s` is 0.
   - The only contribution to `ans` comes from the 0s in `s` that have at least one 1 before them.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`.
     - `zeroes = 3` (count of 0s).
     - `cnt = [3, 2]` (count of 0s and 1s).
     - For the first 0 (index 1), there is a 1 before it, so add 1 to `ans`.
     - For the second 0 (index 3), there is a 1 before it, so add 1 to `ans`.
     - For the third 0 (index 4), there is a 1 before it, so add 1 to `ans`.
     - Therefore, `ans = 3`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the number of 0s in `s` that have at least one 1 before them.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the number of 0s in `s` that have at least one 1 before them.

Output: **number of 0s in `s` that have at least one 1 before them**
