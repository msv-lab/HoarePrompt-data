Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used), and a string `s`. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the initial variables `t` and `s_list` (if they exist) remain unchanged, and the function will have printed the sum of counts for each test case. **
