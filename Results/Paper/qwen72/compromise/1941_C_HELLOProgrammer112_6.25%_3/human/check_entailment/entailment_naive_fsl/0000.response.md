Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the problem of making the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them, which is incorrect. For example, consider the string "mmapnapie". The program will output 2 because it counts "map" once and "pie" once. However, the correct output should be 2, but the characters removed should be the 4th and 9th characters to remove the substrings "map" and "pie" respectively. The program does not account for the overlapping occurrences of these substrings or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Identify all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
2. Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.
3. Output the minimum number of deletions.

The provided program does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.
