Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` is 3.
   - `k` and `q` are input integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is converting each element of the list `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - It then joins these string elements with a space `' '` as the separator.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string.

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, we need to understand what `func_1` does. However, the function `func_1` is not provided in the initial state.
   - Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values in `res`.
   - Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `res`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be a string where each element of `res` is converted to a string and separated by a space.
   - Since the exact values of `res` are not known, we will describe the output in terms of the elements of `res`.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the list containing the result of func_1(n, p))**
