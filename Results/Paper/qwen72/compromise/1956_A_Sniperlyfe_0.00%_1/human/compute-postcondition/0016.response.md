The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `_`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they were processed.**
