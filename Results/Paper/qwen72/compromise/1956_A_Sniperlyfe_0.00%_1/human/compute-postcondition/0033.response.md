Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`**

The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `p` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged. The new value of `p` is a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the user's input, split by spaces, and converted to an integer.
