Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the user input, followed by a list `p` of `k` positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then processes each element `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, it prints the results of `res` for that test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
