To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 2.
2. `_` is 3.
3. `k` and `q` are input integers.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements.
6. `n` is the second element in `qs`.
7. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n` is the second element in `qs`**:
   - Since `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements, `n` will be the integer at index 1 of `qs`.

2. **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**:
   - `func_1(n, p)` is called twice, and the results are stored in the list `res`.
   - Therefore, `res` will contain two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **`print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`**:
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in the list `res` to a string.
   - `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string elements with a space in between.
   - The `print` statement will output the joined string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space. Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical results of `func_1(n, p)`. However, we know that both elements in `res` are the same because `func_1(n, p)` is called twice with the same arguments.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the second element in the list qs and p is the list of integers provided by the user)**
