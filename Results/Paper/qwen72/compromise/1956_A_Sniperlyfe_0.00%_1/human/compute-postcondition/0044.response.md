Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 2.
2. `_` is 3.
3. `k` and `q` are input integers.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements.
6. `n` is the third element in `qs`.
7. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`t` must be greater than 2**: This condition is given but not directly used in the code snippet.
2. **`_` is 3**: This variable is not used in the code snippet.
3. **`k` and `q` are input integers**: These variables are not used in the code snippet.
4. **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user**: This list is used in the function `func_1(n, p)`.
5. **`qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements**: This list is used to extract the third element, `n`.
6. **`n` is the third element in `qs`**: This means `n = qs[2]`.
7. **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice**: This means `res` will be a list with two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Function `func_1(n, p)`:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact output. However, we know that it takes two arguments: `n` (an integer) and `p` (a list of integers), and returns some result.

### `res` List:
- `res` is created by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appending the result twice. Therefore, `res` will look like `[result, result]` where `result` is the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

### `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`:
- The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in `res` to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a space.
- Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the elements in `res` separated by a space.

### Final Output:
- Since `res` contains two identical elements (both the result of `func_1(n, p)`), the output will be the string representation of this result repeated twice, separated by a space.

Output: **result result (where result is the output of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the third element in the `qs` list, and `p` is the list of integers provided by the user)**
