Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged. The list `qs` is still the same list of integers provided by the user. The variable `n` will be the last element in `qs` (since the loop iterates over all elements in `qs`). The list `res` will contain the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they appear in `qs`.
