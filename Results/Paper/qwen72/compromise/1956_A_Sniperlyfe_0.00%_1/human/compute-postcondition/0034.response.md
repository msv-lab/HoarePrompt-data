Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `qs` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `n` is now the last element in the new `qs` list.
- The value of `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in the new `qs` list.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged.
