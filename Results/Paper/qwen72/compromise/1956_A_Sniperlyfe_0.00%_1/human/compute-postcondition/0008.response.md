Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `k` and `q` are input integers.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
6. `n` is the first element in `qs`.
7. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n`**: The first element of the list `qs`. Since `qs` is provided by the user and must have at least one element, `n` is a known integer.
2. **`func_1(n, p)`**: This function is called with `n` and `p` as arguments. The result of this function is stored in the list `res`. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe the output based on the information given.
3. **`res`**: This is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The elements of `res` are the results of the function call, which are integers.
4. **`print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`**: This line converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space, then prints the resulting string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output a string where each element of the list `res` is converted to a string and separated by a space. The elements of `res` are the results of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **[res[0]] [res[1]] ... [res[-1]] (where each [res[i]] is an element of the list `res` resulting from the function `func_1(n, p)`)**

This format ensures that the output is a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, which are the results of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
