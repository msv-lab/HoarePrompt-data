Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user, where 3 <= n <= 78, and prints a decoded word based on the value of `n`. The decoded word is constructed as follows: if `n` > 52, the word is the `n-53`-th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'; if 27 < `n` <= 52, the word is 'a' followed by the `n-28`-th letter of the alphabet and 'z'; if `n` == 27, the word is 'aay'; otherwise, the word is 'aa' followed by the `n-3`-th letter of the alphabet. The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. After the function concludes, `t` test cases will have been processed, and the corresponding decoded words will have been printed. **
