Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**:
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if there is a '1' in the top row and a '0' in the bottom row at the same column. If such a condition is found, it switches to the bottom row at that column.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible paths to find the lexicographically smallest string. It only checks for a specific condition and then switches to the bottom row, which may not always yield the correct result.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting**:
   - The program calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by using a variable `t` and a loop, but the logic is incorrect. It does not correctly count the number of paths that can produce the smallest string.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `print(s, sep='')` which is unnecessary because `print(s)` would suffice. The `sep` parameter is used to specify the separator between multiple arguments in a print statement, which is not needed here.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - Start from the top-left cell and move right or down, always choosing the path that results in the smallest possible string at each step.
   - This can be done by comparing the values in the top and bottom rows at each column and choosing the path that minimizes the string.

2. **Count the Number of Paths**:
   - Once the lexicographically smallest string is determined, count the number of ways to achieve this string by considering the transitions between the top and bottom rows.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a1 = input()
    a2 = input()
    
    # Initialize the smallest string and the path count
    smallest_string = []
    path_count = 1
    
    # Start from the top-left cell
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        # If the top row has a smaller value, continue in the top row
        if a1[i] < a2[i]:
            smallest_string.append(a1[i])
            i += 1
        # If the bottom row has a smaller value, switch to the bottom row
        elif a1[i] > a2[i]:
            smallest_string.append(a2[i])
            i += 1
            # If we switch to the bottom row, we can only continue in the bottom row
            path_count = 1
        # If both rows have the same value, we can choose either row
        else:
            smallest_string.append(a1[i])
            i += 1
            # If we are in the first column, we can only choose the top row
            if i == 1:
                path_count = 1
            # If we are in the last column, we can only choose the bottom row
            elif i == n:
                path_count = 1
            # Otherwise, we can choose either row, so we double the path count
            else:
                path_count *= 2
    
    # Add the last cell of the bottom row
    smallest_string.append(a2[-1])
    
    # Print the results
    print(''.join(smallest_string))
    print(path_count)

# Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected program will correctly find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that yield this string.
