Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values, `s` is the concatenated string of `a[0]` and `a[1][n-1]` if no condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, otherwise `s` is the concatenated string of `a[0][:i + 1]` and `a[1][i:]` where `i` is the first index that meets the condition, `x` is `n-1` if no condition is met, otherwise `x` is the first index `i` that meets the condition.**
