Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function then determines whether it is possible to make all characters in both strings point in the same direction by swapping characters within each string. It prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the last processed values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. **
