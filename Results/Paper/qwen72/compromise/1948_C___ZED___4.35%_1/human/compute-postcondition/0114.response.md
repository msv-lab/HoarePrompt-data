Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `a` and `b` are input strings.
   - `k` is 3.
   - If the second character of `a` is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `k` is explicitly defined as 3 in the initial state.
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `k` is 3, the print statement will output 3.

Output: **3**
