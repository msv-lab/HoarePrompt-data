The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 0 to `n-1` in steps of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1 and at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 2 to 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 to ensure that `k` is still within the range.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1 and at least 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `k` is 4. If the fifth character of `b` (i.e., `b[k]`) is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
