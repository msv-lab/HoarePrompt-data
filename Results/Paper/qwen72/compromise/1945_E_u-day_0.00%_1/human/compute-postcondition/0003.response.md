The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the `range(n)` function. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
