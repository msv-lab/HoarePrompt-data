The code snippet `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from the list `smallList`. Since the initial state specifies that `bigList[-1]` is no longer equal to `smallList[-1]`, removing the last element from `smallList` means that `smallList` now has one fewer element, and its new last element (if any remains) is different from `bigList[-1]`.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but `bigList[-1]` is no longer equal to the new last element of `smallList` (if any remains).**
