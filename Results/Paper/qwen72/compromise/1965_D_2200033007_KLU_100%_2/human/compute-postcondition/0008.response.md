The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Given the initial conditions, the length of `smallList` was already reduced by 1, and now it is further reduced by 1 due to the `pop()` operation. The length of `bigList` remains unchanged from its reduced state.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. The length of `smallList` is reduced by 2, and the length of `bigList` is reduced by 1.**
