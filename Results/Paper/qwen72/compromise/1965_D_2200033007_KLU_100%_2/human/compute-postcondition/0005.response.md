The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from the `smallList`. Since the last element of `bigList` was not equal to the last element of `smallList`, removing the last element from `smallList` does not affect the relationship between the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList`.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. The length of `smallList` is reduced by 1.**
