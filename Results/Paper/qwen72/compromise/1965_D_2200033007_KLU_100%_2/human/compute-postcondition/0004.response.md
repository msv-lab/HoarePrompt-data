The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `bigList`. Since `bigList[-1]` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, after removing this element, the last element of `bigList` will no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
