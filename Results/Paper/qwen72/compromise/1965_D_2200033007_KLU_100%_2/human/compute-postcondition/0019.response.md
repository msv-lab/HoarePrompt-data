The only object in the loop head is the variable `x` and the iterable `odds`. The state of `odds` determines whether the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `odds` must have at least one more element to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `odds` must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is now equal to the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `odds` must have at least two elements (since one has already been used), and `x` will be the next element in `odds`.

State: **`odds` must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is now equal to the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**
