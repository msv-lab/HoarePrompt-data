Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly address the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **func_1**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This is used to verify the correctness of the solution by comparing the generated subarray sums with the input sums.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times in the list of subarray sums. In a palindrome, each element (except possibly the middle one in the case of an odd-length array) appears twice, so the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times will help identify the elements of the array.

3. **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums identified in `func_2`. It places the values in the correct positions to ensure the array is a palindrome.

4. **func_4**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but could be used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the given list of subarray sums.

The overall approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The functions work together to reconstruct a valid palindrome array from the given subarray sums, ensuring that the output is a palindrome and matches the input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
