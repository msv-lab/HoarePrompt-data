- The functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` generates the complete set of subarray sums.
   - `func_2` identifies the unique subarray sums.
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindromic array.
   - `func_4` finds the missing subarray sum.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
