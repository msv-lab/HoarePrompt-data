### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one.

2. **Output for n = 2:**
   - For `n = 2`, the function prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - The Manhattan distances between these points are:
     - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
     - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

3. **Output for n = 3:**
   - For `n = 3`, the function prints the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
   - The Manhattan distances between these points are:
     - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
     - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
     - `|1-2| + |1-3| = 3`
     - `|1-1| + |2-2| = 0`
     - `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

4. **Output for n > 3:**
   - For `n > 3`, the function prints the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then for each \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), it prints \((j, j)\).
   - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are always printed, ensuring a minimum set of distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
   - The point \((2, 4)\) is printed, which adds more distances:
     - `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
     - `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) are printed, which ensures that the diagonal points are included. The distances between these points and the initial points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) will be:
     - `|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)`
     - `|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1`
   - These distances will be distinct for each \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), ensuring a large set of distinct Manhattan distances.

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The function ensures that the points are chosen in such a way that the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.
   - The logic for \(n > 3\) is sound, as it includes points that cover a wide range of distances, including the diagonal points which add a significant number of distinct distances.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the input and outputs points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given grid size \(n\). The logic is consistent and ensures that the maximum number of distinct distances is achieved for each test case.
