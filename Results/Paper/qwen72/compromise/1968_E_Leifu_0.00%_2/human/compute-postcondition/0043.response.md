Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop iterates over the range starting from 4 up to and including `n`. Each iteration, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop will have printed each integer from 4 to `n` twice, but this does not affect the final state of the variables.
