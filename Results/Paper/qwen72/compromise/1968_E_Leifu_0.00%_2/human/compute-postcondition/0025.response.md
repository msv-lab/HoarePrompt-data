The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 5, and `n` must still be at least 5.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 5, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**
