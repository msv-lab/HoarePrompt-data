The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 6. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
