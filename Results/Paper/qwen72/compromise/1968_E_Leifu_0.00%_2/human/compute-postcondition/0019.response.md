The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. The initial state describes the values of `n`, `t`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **1 1**
