Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `n` is at least 4, `j` is set to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'2 4'`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, and `j` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'2 4'` regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

Output: **2 4**
