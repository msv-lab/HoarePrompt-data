Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. If the new value of `n` is 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the new value of `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`. However, since the code snippet provided only updates `n` and does not set `j`, `j` is not mentioned in the output state.
