The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. The values of the variables `n`, `t`, `i`, and `j` (if `j` is set) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string being printed is a constant and does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **1 1**
