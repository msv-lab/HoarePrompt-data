Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` and `t` are reassigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `t` are reassigned based on the input provided.
- The input is split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The new values of `n` and `t` are taken from the input, but `t` remains 1 as per the initial state.
- The other variables (`nodes` and `start`) are not affected by this code snippet.
