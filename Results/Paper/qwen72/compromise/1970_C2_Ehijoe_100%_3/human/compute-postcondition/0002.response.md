Output State: **`n` and `t` are reassigned the values from the input split by space, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is now set to `True`. The values of `n` and `t` are reassigned from the input split by space, and the other variables (`edges`, `nodes`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
