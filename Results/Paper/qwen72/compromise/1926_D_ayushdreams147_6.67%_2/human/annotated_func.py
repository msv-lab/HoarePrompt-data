#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` or its transformed version, and the value is the count of how many times the transformed version of the key appears in the list, adjusted by the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It applies the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer in the list and returns the number of unique integers in the transformed list. The function also modifies a dictionary `count` where each key is an integer from the list `a` or its transformed version, and the value is the count of how many times the transformed version of the key appears in the list, adjusted by the loop. However, the final state of `count` is not part of the function's return value.
