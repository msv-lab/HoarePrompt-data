### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two lists: `mex` to store the constructed permutation and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values used in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it means `p_i` is the smallest unused non-negative integer, which is `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a_i` is negative, it means `p_i` is a value that is not the smallest unused non-negative integer, but rather a value that makes `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` equal to `arr[i]`.
   - It also updates `maxx` to ensure that the maximum value used in the permutation is correctly tracked.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given `a` array.
   - It ensures that the permutation `p` is a valid permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and steps are aligned with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
