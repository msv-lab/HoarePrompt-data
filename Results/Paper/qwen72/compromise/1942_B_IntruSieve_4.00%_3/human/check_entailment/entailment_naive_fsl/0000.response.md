Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
-1 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 0 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 1 2
```

In this case, the array `a` is `[-1, 0, 1]`. The expected permutation `p` should be `[1, 0, 2]` because:
- For `p_1 = 1`, `a_1 = MEX(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1`.
- For `p_2 = 0`, `a_2 = MEX(1, 0) - 0 = 2 - 0 = 0`.
- For `p_3 = 2`, `a_3 = MEX(1, 0, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.

However, the program outputs `[0, 1, 2]`, which does not satisfy the given `a` array:
- For `p_1 = 0`, `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1` (expected -1).
- For `p_2 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (expected 0).
- For `p_3 = 2`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (expected 1).

The program fails to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given `a` array in this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
