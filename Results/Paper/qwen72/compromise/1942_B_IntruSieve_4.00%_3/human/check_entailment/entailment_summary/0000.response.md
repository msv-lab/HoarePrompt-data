Reasoning:  
The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given rules. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` keeps track of the smallest integer that has not been used yet, and `maxx` keeps track of the largest integer that has been used.

2. **Processing the Array `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means that the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is greater than `p_i`. Therefore, `p_i` should be the smallest unused integer, which is `minn`. After appending `minn` to `mex`, `minn` is incremented. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it means that all integers from 0 to `maxx` have been used, so `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it means that the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is less than or equal to `p_i`. The value to append to `mex` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which should be the integer that, when subtracted from `p_i`, gives `arr[i]`. If this value exceeds `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to this value.

3. **Output**:
   - The elements of `mex` are printed separated by spaces, followed by a newline.

Let's verify if this logic is correct:

- **Positive Elements in `a`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is greater than `p_i`. The smallest unused integer is `minn`, so appending `minn` and incrementing it is correct. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it means all integers from 0 to `maxx` have been used, so `minn` is set to `maxx + 1` to ensure the next smallest unused integer is used.

- **Non-Positive Elements in `a`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is non-positive, the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is less than or equal to `p_i`. The value to append is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which should be the integer that, when subtracted from `p_i`, gives `arr[i]`. This ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and that the permutation is valid.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling non-positive elements. The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` should be the integer that, when subtracted from `p_i`, gives `arr[i]`. This implies that `p_i` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn) + minn`. The current logic only appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`, which might not be correct.

To fix this, the correct value to append should be `abs(arr[i] - minn) + minn` instead of just `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

Given this, the current program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the non-positive elements in the array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
