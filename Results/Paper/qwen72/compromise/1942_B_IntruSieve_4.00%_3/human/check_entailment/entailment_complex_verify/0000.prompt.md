You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array a of length n with elements a_i (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers, `mex` is a list of integers representing the appended values based on the conditions in the loop, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after all iterations, `maxx` is the final value of `maxx` after all iterations.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The loop prints each element of the `mex` list separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` from the input. It processes the array to generate a list `mex` of integers based on the values in `a`. For each positive element in `a`, it appends the current value of `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`. For each non-positive element in `a`, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to `mex`, and updates `maxx` if this difference exceeds the current `maxx`. Finally, it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
-1 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 0 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 1 2
```

In this case, the array `a` is `[-1, 0, 1]`. The expected permutation `p` should be `[1, 0, 2]` because:
- For `p_1 = 1`, `a_1 = MEX(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1`.
- For `p_2 = 0`, `a_2 = MEX(1, 0) - 0 = 2 - 0 = 0`.
- For `p_3 = 2`, `a_3 = MEX(1, 0, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.

However, the program outputs `[0, 1, 2]`, which does not satisfy the given `a` array:
- For `p_1 = 0`, `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1` (expected -1).
- For `p_2 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (expected 0).
- For `p_3 = 2`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (expected 1).

The program fails to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given `a` array in this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
