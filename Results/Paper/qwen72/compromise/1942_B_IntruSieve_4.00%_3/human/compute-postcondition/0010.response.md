Initial State: The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The loop prints each element of the `mex` list separated by a space.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `n` is a variable with a certain value.
- `arr` is a list with certain elements.
- `minn` and `maxx` are variables with certain values.
- `mex` is a list whose elements are to be printed, separated by a space.

However, the provided code snippet is an empty `print()` statement, which does not print any specific content. Since the `print()` statement is empty, it will only print a newline character.

Output: **(an empty line)**
