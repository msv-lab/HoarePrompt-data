Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. Specifically, the `char_map` dictionary is created by mapping each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, but it should map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters from the original string `s`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
abc
```
The correct output should be:
```
cba
```
However, the program will output:
```
zyx
```
This is because the program incorrectly maps 'a' to 'z', 'b' to 'y', and 'c' to 'x', instead of mapping 'a' to 'c', 'b' to 'b', and 'c' to 'a'. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
