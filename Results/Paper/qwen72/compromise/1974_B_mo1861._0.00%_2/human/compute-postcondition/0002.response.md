To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `i`: The index variable.
- `c`: The character variable.
- `b`: The string being processed.
- `set(b)`: A set of unique characters from the string `b`.
- `sorted(set(b))`: A sorted list of unique characters from the string `b`.

For the loop to execute:
1. `b` must be a non-empty string, because if `b` is empty, `set(b)` will be an empty set, and `sorted(set(b))` will be an empty list, causing the loop to not execute at all.
2. `i` and `c` will be initialized by the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted beforehand.
3. `char_map` is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `b` is not empty. Since the length of `b` is already specified to be between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5, we can assume it is non-empty. However, for clarity, we should explicitly state that `b` must have at least one character.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first character in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`**
