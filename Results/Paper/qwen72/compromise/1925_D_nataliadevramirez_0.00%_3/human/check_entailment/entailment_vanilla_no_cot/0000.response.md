Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Friendship Value Increase Calculation**: The program calculates the total friendship value increase as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each pair. This formula assumes that each pair is chosen every time, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

2. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\). This probability should be used to compute the expected value of the friendship increase for each pair.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen should be calculated by considering the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions, which is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \) for each pair. The total expected value is then the sum of these expected increases for all pairs.

4. **Modular Inverse**: The program does not handle the modular inverse calculation required to compute the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary because the expected value involves division, which needs to be handled using modular arithmetic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
def mod_inv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    inv_total_pairs = mod_inv(total_pairs, MOD)
    expected_value = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        expected_increase = (f * k) % MOD
        expected_value = (expected_value + expected_increase * inv_total_pairs) % MOD
    
    return expected_value

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation:
- **mod_inv**: This function computes the modular inverse of `x` modulo `MOD` using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that \( x^{-1} \equiv x^{p-2} \pmod{p} \) for a prime \( p \).
- **total_pairs**: This calculates the total number of possible pairs of children.
- **inv_total_pairs**: This is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, used to compute the probability of choosing a specific pair.
- **expected_increase**: This calculates the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions.
- **expected_value**: This accumulates the expected values for all pairs and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
