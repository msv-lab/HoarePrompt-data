Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of children), `m` (the number of friend pairs), `k` (the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples representing friend pairs and their initial friendship values). It calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k`, modulo a constant `MOD`. The function returns this sum, and the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
