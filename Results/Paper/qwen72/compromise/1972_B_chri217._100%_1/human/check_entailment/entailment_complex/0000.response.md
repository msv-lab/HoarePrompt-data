Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins, with specific rules for when there are only one or two coins left. The key to solving this problem is understanding the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.

### Analysis of the Functions:

1. **func_1:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
   - It constructs a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s`.
   - The function correctly reads the input and formats it as required.

2. **func_2:**
   - This function takes a tuple `case` as input, where `case[0]` is the integer `n` and `case[1]` is the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s` using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - It then returns "YES" if the count of "U" characters is even, and "NO" if the count is odd.

### Correctness of the Solution:

- **Parity of "U" Coins:**
  - The game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of "U" coins is even, Alice can always ensure that Bob is left with an odd number of "U" coins, and vice versa.
  - This is because each move removes one "U" coin and flips two adjacent coins, which changes the parity of the number of "U" coins.
  - If the number of "U" coins is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of "U" coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to lose when no "U" coins are left.
  - Conversely, if the number of "U" coins is odd, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of "U" coins, and Alice will eventually be forced to lose.

- **Special Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the special cases where there are only one or two coins left, as the parity rule still applies.
  - If there is only one coin left, the game ends immediately, and the player whose turn it is loses.
  - If there are two coins left, one coin will be removed, and the other will not be flipped, which still follows the parity rule.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The input handling and the logic for determining the winner are both correct.

Correctness: **True**
