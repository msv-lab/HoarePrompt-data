### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`.
   - The function appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases` and returns this list.
   - This part of the code is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It counts the number of coins facing up (`'U'`) using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - The function then checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`ups % 2` is `1`). If it is, the function returns 'NO' (indicating Bob wins); otherwise, it returns 'YES' (indicating Alice wins).
   - This is a critical point in the original assessment. The original assessment states that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins. However, the function returns 'NO' if `ups % 2` is `1`, which means Bob wins when the number of facing-up coins is odd. This is a logical error.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem states that the game will end in a finite number of operations and one of them will win. This is consistent with the parity logic.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins initially, which would result in an immediate loss for the player whose turn it is.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins, which matches the required output format. However, due to the logical error in the winning condition, the function returns the opposite of what it should.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in the winning condition. It returns 'NO' when the number of facing-up coins is odd, which should be 'YES' for Alice to win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
