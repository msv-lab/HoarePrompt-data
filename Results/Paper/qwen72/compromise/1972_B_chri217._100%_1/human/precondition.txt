The function `read_input` is intended to read input data, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins. The input starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
