### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start and end of segments of the same number.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the edge case where the last segment of the same number is not processed. This is a valid approach to ensure the last segment is processed, but it can be confusing and is not necessary if the last segment is handled explicitly.
   - It iterates through the array and constructs a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of the same number. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the segment.
   - The length of `arr` is stored in `LA`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of queries.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - The logic for handling the query is flawed:
     - The program assumes that the first segment starting at or after `l` is the only segment to consider, which is incorrect. It should consider all segments that overlap with the range `[l, r]`.
     - The conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are not comprehensive enough. The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]`.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]`.
- If no such pair exists, it should print `-1 -1`.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input:
  ```
  5
  5
  1 1 2 1 1
  3
  1 5
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
  - The segments are: `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.
  - For the query `(1, 5)`, the program should find the pair `(2, 3)` because `a_2 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`.
  - For the query `(1, 2)`, the program should print `(-1, -1)` because all elements in the range are the same.
  - For the query `(1, 3)`, the program should find the pair `(1, 3)` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`.

- The current logic in the program does not handle these cases correctly. It only considers the first segment starting at or after `l`, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the program's logic for handling queries is flawed.
- The program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding a valid pair of indices within the given range `[l, r]`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
