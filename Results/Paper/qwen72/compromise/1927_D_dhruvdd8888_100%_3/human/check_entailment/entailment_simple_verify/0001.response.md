### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start and end of segments of the same number.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the edge case where the last segment of the same number is not processed. This is a valid approach to ensure the last segment is included in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the array and constructs a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of the same number. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the segment.
   - The length of `arr` is stored in `LA`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of queries.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries and the number to determine if a valid pair of indices exists:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If so, it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints `s` and `e+1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues:
1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The segment construction logic is correct. Appending `-1` to `nums` ensures that the last segment is processed, which is a valid approach.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding a valid pair of indices.
   - Specifically, the conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are not comprehensive enough. The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `(l, r)`.
   - The current logic only checks the segment at `eli` and the next segment, which may not cover all cases where a valid pair exists.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `(l, r)`.
- If no such pair exists, it should print `-1 -1`.

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the query handling logic is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.
- The program's current logic only checks a limited set of segments and may miss valid pairs of indices.
- Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final: **False**
