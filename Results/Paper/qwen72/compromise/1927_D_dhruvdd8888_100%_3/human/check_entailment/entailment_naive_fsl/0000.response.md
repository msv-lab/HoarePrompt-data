Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of different elements within the given range is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
1 5
2 4
3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
2 3
-1 -1
```

Actual Output:
```
1 2
2 3
-1 -1
```

The program fails in the third query (3 3) because it incorrectly prints `-1 -1` when it should print `-1 -1` since there are no two different indices within the range [3, 3] that have different elements. However, the program's logic is flawed in a more general sense. For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
1
1 6
```

Expected Output:
```
-1 -1
```

Actual Output:
```
1 2
```

The program incorrectly prints `1 2` when it should print `-1 -1` because all elements in the range [1, 6] are the same. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the queried range are the same.
