Output State: **The loop will terminate when the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is no longer met. After all iterations, `i` will be `d + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k` elements removed. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `row[i]` is updated by adding `e[0]` (the value popped from the heap) and 1 to the current value of `row[i]`.
- The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged.
- The loop termination condition and the state of `min_heap` and `i` after the loop are still valid as described in the initial state.
