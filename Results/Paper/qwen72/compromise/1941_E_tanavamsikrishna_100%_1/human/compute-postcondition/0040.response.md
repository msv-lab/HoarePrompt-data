Output State: **`i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed, and `row[i]` is updated to the value of the smallest element in `min_heap` (excluding elements with indices less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`) plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1.**
