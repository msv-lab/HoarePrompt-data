Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `len(costs) - k`, and `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `i` has reached the value `len(costs) - k`, which is the last index from where a contiguous subsequence of length `k` can be taken from `costs`. The list `total_costs` now contains the sum of every such subsequence, effectively capturing the total costs for each possible `k`-length segment of the `costs` list. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
