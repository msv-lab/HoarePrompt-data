To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `min_heap`: This is a heap from which the smallest element (tuple) is being popped.
- `i`: This is the current value of the variable `i`.
- `d`: This is a constant that remains unchanged.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
The loop will execute if the second element of the tuple `e` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `d + k + 3`
- `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements (this is not relevant to the loop head condition)
- `d` remains unchanged
- `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k + 1`

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: The value of `i` is `d + k + 3`.
2. **`d`**: This is a constant and does not change.
3. **`min_heap`**: The heap must contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true. Let's break this down:

- `i - (d + 2)` = `(d + k + 3) - (d + 2)` = `k + 1`

So, the condition simplifies to:
- `e[1] <= k + 1`

### Adjusting the State:
- The condition `e[1] <= k + 1` must be true for the loop to execute.
- Given that `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k + 1`, we need to ensure that the next element popped from `min_heap` has `e[1]` less than or equal to `k + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the content of `min_heap` to ensure that the next element popped has `e[1]` less than or equal to `k + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `d + k + 3`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k + 1`**
