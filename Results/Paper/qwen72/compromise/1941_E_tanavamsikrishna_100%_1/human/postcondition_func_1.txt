The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a grid of river depths. It calculates the minimum total depth of the river cells that need to be bridged to build `k` bridges, ensuring the distance between any two supports does not exceed `d`. The function then prints this minimum total depth.
