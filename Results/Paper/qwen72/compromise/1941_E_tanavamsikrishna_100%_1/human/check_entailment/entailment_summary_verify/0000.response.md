### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Initialization of the First `d` Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the first `d` elements of the row by setting `row[0] = 1` and `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `1 <= i < d`. This is incorrect because the cost of installing a support in the first cell should be `a_{i,1} + 1 = 1` (since `a_{i,1} = 0`), and the cost for the next `d-1` cells should be `a_{i,j} + 1` (not `a_{i,j} + 2`).

2. **Heap Management**:
   - The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports. However, the way it manages the heap and calculates the cost for each cell is flawed.
   - Specifically, the line `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. The distance between supports should be `|j_1 - j_2| - 1`, but the condition `i - (d + 2)` does not correctly reflect this. It should be `i - (d + 1)` to ensure the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is also incorrect. The correct cost should be `row[i] + 1` plus the minimum cost of the previous valid support, which should be within the distance `d`.

### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the input provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 0 2 0
0 3 0 3 0
```
For the first row:
- The correct initialization should be `row = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` (since `a_{i,1} + 1 = 1`, `a_{i,2} + 1 = 2`, `a_{i,3} + 1 = 1`, `a_{i,4} + 1 = 2`, `a_{i,5} + 1 = 1`).
- The heap should be initialized with `[(1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2)]`.
- For `i = 3` (the fourth element), the heap should contain `[(1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2)]`. The minimum element is `(1, 0)`, but it is not within the valid distance `d = 2`. The next minimum element is `(1, 2)`, which is valid. The cost should be `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, resulting in `row = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`.
- For `i = 4` (the fifth element), the heap should contain `[(2, 1), (3, 3), (1, 4)]`. The minimum element is `(1, 2)`, but it is not within the valid distance `d = 2`. The next minimum element is `(1, 4)`, which is valid. The cost should be `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, resulting in `row = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3]`.

The final cost for the first row is `3`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `4`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the implementation of `func_1`. The program does not correctly handle the conditions for the distance between supports and the cost calculation, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
