### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The issue lies in how the minimum heap is managed and the cost for each cell is calculated. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization of the First `d` Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by setting `row[0] = 1` and then adds 2 to each element in the range `1` to `d-1`. This is done to account for the cost of installing supports in these cells.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the first `d` elements are properly initialized.

2. **Heap Management:**
   - A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of the row. This heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to the current cell.
   - The loop then iterates over the rest of the row starting from index `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each cell `i` starting from `d`, the program pops elements from the heap that are too far away (i.e., their index is less than `i - (d + 2)`). This is intended to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost for the current cell `i` is then calculated as `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e[0]` is the cost of the minimum element in the heap.
   - The program then pushes the current cost back into the heap and also pushes the new cost for the current cell `i`.

4. **Flaw in Cost Calculation:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - Specifically, the program does not ensure that the minimum element in the heap is within the required distance `d` from the current cell `i`. The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect. It should be `e[1] < i - d` to ensure the distance is no more than `d`.

### Example Case:
Consider the example input provided:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 0 2 0
0 3 0 3 0
```
- **First Row:**
  - After initialization, `row = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - For `i = 3` (the fourth element), the heap will contain `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]`.
  - The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 0)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fourth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.
  - For `i = 4` (the fifth element), the heap will contain `[(3, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)]`.
  - The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 2)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fifth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 3]`.

The final cost for the first row is `3`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `4` because the minimum cost to build a bridge with the maximum distance `d = 2` between supports is to build it on the first row, where the cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program. The incorrect handling of the heap and the cost calculation for each cell leads to the program producing incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
