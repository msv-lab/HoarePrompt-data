Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least `k` tuples, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1` if `check(l)` is true, or `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false if `check(l)` is false.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- During each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `r`.
- If `check(mid)` returns `True`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, meaning the loop is searching for a larger value that also satisfies `check`.
- If `check(mid)` returns `False`, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`, meaning the loop is searching for a smaller value that satisfies `check`.
- The loop will terminate when `l` becomes greater than `r`.
- After the loop terminates:
  - If `check(l)` is true, `l` will be the smallest integer for which `check` returns true, and `r` will be `l - 1`.
  - If `check(l)` is false, `r` will be the largest integer for which `check` returns false, and `l` will be `r + 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, and `c`) remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
