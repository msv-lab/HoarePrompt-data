The function `func_1` processes a series of time strings provided by the user in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59). For each input time string, it converts the time to a 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" based on the hour. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the converted time strings directly to the console. The original input time strings are not modified or stored.
