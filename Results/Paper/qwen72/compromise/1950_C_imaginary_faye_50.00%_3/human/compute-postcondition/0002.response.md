The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the output is based on a string `time_str` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59. Since the function does not take any parameters, it is unclear how `time_str` is provided or used within the function. Assuming `time_str` is somehow defined within the function, the output would depend on the value of `time_str`.

Given the lack of parameters in the function definition, and assuming `time_str` is used internally, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a time string `time_str` in the format "hh:mm" and returns a value based on the time represented by `time_str`. If `time_str` is not provided or is invalid, the behavior is undefined.**
