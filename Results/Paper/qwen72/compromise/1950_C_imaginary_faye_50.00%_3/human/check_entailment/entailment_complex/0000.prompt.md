Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: time_str is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The output state is a series of strings, each representing a time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" based on the input times. The variable `time_str` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of time strings provided by the user in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59). For each input time string, it converts the time to a 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" based on the hour. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the converted time strings directly to the console. The original input time strings are not modified or stored.
