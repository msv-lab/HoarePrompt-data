### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Time Parsing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` which is in the format `hh:mm`.
   - It extracts the hour part `h` using `s[:2]`.

3. **Hour Conversion:**
   - If the hour `h` is `00`, it prints `12` (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary using `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

4. **Minute and AM/PM Handling:**
   - It prints the minute part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on whether the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Hour Conversion:**
  - The code correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
  - For `00`, it correctly prints `12`.
  - For hours `01` to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
  - For hours `13` to `23`, it correctly subtracts `12` and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary using `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

- **Minute Handling:**
  - The code correctly prints the minute part `s[2:]` without any modifications, which is appropriate since the minute format is the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

- **AM/PM Determination:**
  - The code correctly determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on the hour value.

### Edge Cases:

- **Midnight (00:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `00:00` to `12:00 AM`.

- **Noon (12:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `12:00` to `12:00 PM`.

- **Hours 13 to 23:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `13` to `23` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `PM`.

- **Hours 01 to 11:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `01` to `11` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `AM`.

### Issues Identified:

- **Leading Zero for Hours 1 to 9:**
  - The code uses `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` for hours greater than `12`. This will correctly print hours `13` to `23` as `01` to `11` with a leading zero.
  - However, for hours `01` to `09`, the code should ensure that the hour is printed with a leading zero. The current implementation does not handle this correctly. For example, `09:41` should be printed as `09:41 AM`, but the code will print `9:41 AM`.

### Corrected Code:

To handle the leading zero for hours `01` to `09`, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(f'{int(h):02d}', end='')  # Ensure leading zero for hours 01 to 09
        else:
            print(f'{int(h) - 12:02d}', end='')  # Ensure leading zero for hours 01 to 09
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it missed the issue with leading zeros for hours `01` to `09`. This issue makes the program incorrect as it does not produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
