Output State: **The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. The number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 <= t <= 10^4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. The variable `n` is now an input integer. The list `arr` is assigned the values from the input, where each element is converted to an integer.**
