The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and the constraints are `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5` and `1 <= t <= 10^4`, where `t` is the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` for each of the `t` test cases, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` for each of the `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. It returns a result for each test case.**
