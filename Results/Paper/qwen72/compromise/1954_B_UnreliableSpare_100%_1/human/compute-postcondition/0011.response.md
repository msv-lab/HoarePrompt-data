The `print(-1)` statement will print the integer `-1`. 

The precondition provides information about several variables (`a`, `n`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
