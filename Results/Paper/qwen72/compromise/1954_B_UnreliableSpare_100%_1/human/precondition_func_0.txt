The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 <= t <= 10^4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
