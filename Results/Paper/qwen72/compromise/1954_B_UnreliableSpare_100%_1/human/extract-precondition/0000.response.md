Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 <= t <= 10^4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem's requirements:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`.
