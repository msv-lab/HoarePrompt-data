Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for cases where \(1 < k < n\). The program only handles two specific cases:
1. When \(k = n\), it generates an array with all elements equal to 1, which is correct.
2. When \(k = 1\), it generates an array with elements from 0 to \(n-1\), which is also correct.

However, for other values of \(k\) (where \(1 < k < n\)), the program simply outputs \([-1]\), which is incorrect. For example, consider the case where \(n = 4\) and \(k = 2\). A valid array could be \([1, 2, 1, 2]\), which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 1, 2]\) and \([2, 1, 2, 1]\). The program fails to generate such a valid array and incorrectly outputs \([-1]\).
