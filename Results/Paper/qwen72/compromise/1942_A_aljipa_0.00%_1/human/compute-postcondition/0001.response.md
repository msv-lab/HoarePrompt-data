The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration index**
