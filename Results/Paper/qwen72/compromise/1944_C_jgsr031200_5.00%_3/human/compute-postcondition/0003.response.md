The only variables in the loop head are `nums` and `start`. The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`, which means the loop will execute if the value of `nums[start]` is greater than 0. Given that `start` is 0, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Right before the loop, `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `start` is 0. For the loop to execute, `nums[0]` must be greater than 0, which means that the integer 0 must appear at least once in the list `arr`.

Since `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= arr[i] < len(arr) for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `vis` is an empty set, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `nums[0]` is greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= arr[i] < len(arr) for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr` and `nums[0]` must be greater than 0; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set**
