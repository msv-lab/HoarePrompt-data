The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
