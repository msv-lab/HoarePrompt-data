Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to group disks that are tangent to each other and tries to determine if it's possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the logic for updating the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) and checking the feasibility of the solution is flawed.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
This input represents three disks with centers at (0, 0), (2, 0), and (4, 0), each with a radius of 1. The disks are tangent to each other in a linear sequence.

The program will:
1. Start a DFS from the first disk (0, 0, 1).
2. Visit the second disk (2, 0, 1) and set `coef0[1] = 1 + 1 - coef0[0]` and `coef1[1] = -coef1[0]`.
3. Visit the third disk (4, 0, 1) and set `coef0[2] = 1 + 1 - coef0[1]` and `coef1[2] = -coef1[1]`.

After the DFS, the coefficients will be:
- `coef0 = [0, 2, 0]`
- `coef1 = [1, -1, 1]`

The program then checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero. In this case, the sum is `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`, which is non-zero, so the program will print "YES".

However, this is incorrect. The problem requires that the sum of the radii strictly decreases, and the new radii should maintain tangency and avoid overlap. In this specific case, it is not possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. The disks are already in a configuration where any change in radius that maintains tangency will not decrease the sum of the radii.

Therefore, the correct output for this input should be "NO", but the program incorrectly outputs "YES". This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
