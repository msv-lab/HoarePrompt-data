### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers: `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. These values are stored in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. This part of the function correctly handles the input as specified in the problem.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists. `visited` is initialized to `False` for all disks, `coef0` is initialized to `None`, and `coef1` is initialized to `1`. The `nodes` list is initialized as an empty list.

3. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The function `dfs` is used to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, and the `nodes` list to store the indices of the disks in the current connected component.
   - For each disk `i` that is not visited, `coef0[i]` is set to `0` and `coef1[i]` is set to `1`. Then, for each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers), the function updates `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` and recursively calls `dfs` on `j`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - After the DFS for each connected component, the function calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` values for the disks in the current component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` values for any connected component is non-zero, the function sets `ok` to `True`. This indicates that it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` and `NO` otherwise. This correctly follows the problem's requirement to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks as specified.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Tangency Check**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` correctly checks if two disks are tangent to each other.
- **Connected Components**: The DFS correctly identifies connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
- **Coefficient Update**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated in a way that ensures the sum of radii can be adjusted. Specifically, `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` are used to ensure that the sum of radii can be reduced while maintaining tangency.
- **Sum of Coefficients**: The sum of `coef1` values for a connected component being non-zero indicates that it is possible to adjust the radii within that component to reduce the total sum of radii.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks as specified in the problem. The input handling, DFS traversal, coefficient updates, and final output are all in line with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
