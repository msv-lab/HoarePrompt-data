### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
   - The function adds 1 to the cost of each cell to account for the installation cost.
   - The final cost for the row is the cost of the last cell in the row.

3. **Annotated Function 1:**
   - The first loop increments the cost of the first `d-1` elements by 1.
   - The second loop updates the cost of each cell from index `d-1` to the end by adding the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

4. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths and stores it in `rows`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and appends these sums to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

5. **Annotated Function 2:**
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The cost for each row is calculated using `func_1` and stored in `costs`.
   - The sliding window approach is used to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - The minimum total cost is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints given in the problem, such as the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have a depth of 0, as required by the problem.

7. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - The sliding window approach used in `func_2` to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

8. **Challenges to the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that `func_1` always returns 0, which is incorrect. The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which is not necessarily 0.
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the row to ensure that the cost of each cell is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus 1, and the last cell's cost is returned.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and uses the sliding window approach to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is mostly accurate, but it incorrectly states that `func_1` always returns 0. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row and returns the cost of the last cell, which is the correct behavior for the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
