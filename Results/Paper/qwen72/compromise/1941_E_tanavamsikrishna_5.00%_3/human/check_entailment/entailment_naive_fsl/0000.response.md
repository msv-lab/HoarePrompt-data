Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the cost of installing supports. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function attempts to update the cost of each cell in the row, but it does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals to meet the distance constraint.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
Here, the river grid is:
```
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
The program should find the minimum cost to build a bridge in one of the rows with the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than 2.

However, the program's `func_1` function will incorrectly compute the cost for each row. For the first row, it will update the costs as follows:
- `row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `row[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[2] = min(row[0:2]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[3] = min(row[1:3]) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[4] = min(row[2:4]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the total cost for the first row is `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9`.

However, the correct minimum cost for the first row should be `4` because the supports can be placed at positions (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5), which satisfies the distance constraint and results in a total cost of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
