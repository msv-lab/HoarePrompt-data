Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not generate a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function `func_1` simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the resulting string.

For example, for the input `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will output `aabb`. However, the string `aabb` does not contain the subsequence `ba`, which is one of the required subsequences (the others being `aa`, `ab`, and `ba`).

A correct approach would involve generating a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. One such approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length from a set of characters. However, for simplicity, a more straightforward method can be used to construct the string by ensuring that each character appears in every possible position relative to the other characters.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import itertools

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = de_bruijn(k, n)
    print(s)

def de_bruijn(k, n):
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k characters
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
    subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    # Construct the de Bruijn sequence
    db_sequence = []
    for subseq in subsequences:
        db_sequence.append(subseq)
    
    # Join the subsequences to form the final string
    return ''.join(db_sequence)
```

This program generates all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters and then concatenates them to form the final string. This ensures that all required subsequences are present in the string `s`.

However, this approach may not produce the shortest possible string. A more efficient approach would be to construct a de Bruijn sequence, which is known to be the shortest string containing all possible subsequences of a given length. For the purpose of this problem, the above solution is a straightforward and correct approach, but it may not be the most optimal.
