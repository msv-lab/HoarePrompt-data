Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. However, this value is not used in the loop that follows. Instead, the program always reads 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should dictate how many times the loop runs.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop that reads the pairs of integers iterates 10 times, which is hardcoded. This does not align with the problem description, which states that the number of test cases `t` should be between 1 and 100. The loop should iterate `t` times, not 10 times.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers `x[i]` and `y[i]`. However, due to the incorrect handling of the number of test cases, the program will not work as expected if `t` is not 10.

4. **State Comments**: The comments provided are generally correct, but they do not reflect the issue with the hardcoded loop iteration.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases `t` as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
