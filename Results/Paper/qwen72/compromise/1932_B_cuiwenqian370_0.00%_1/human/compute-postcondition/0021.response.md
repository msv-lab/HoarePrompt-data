Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated based on the conditions: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1] and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.**
