### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in a specific sequence.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve a different problem. It appears to be a dynamic programming solution for a path traversal problem where certain characters (`@` and `*`) have specific meanings.
   - The function `func_1` is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs. It is not designed to handle periodic occurrences of signs and sequential waiting.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
   - However, it incorrectly treats the periodicities `a_i` as a single string `path` and passes it to `func_1`.
   - `func_1` is not designed to handle the periodicities of signs, so it will not produce the correct output for this problem.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.
   - For each test case, we should compute the LCM of the periodicities and output that as the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to find the year when the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities of the signs. The input handling and the logic within `func_1` are completely unrelated to the problem at hand.

Final: **False**
