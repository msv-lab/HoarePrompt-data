### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case within a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Check for All Identical Elements:**
   - The function converts the array `a` to a set `aa` to check if all elements are identical.
   - If the set `aa` has only one unique element, the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Consecutive Segments:**
   - The function initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a` and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and counts the length of consecutive segments of the same integer (`tmp`).
   - When a different integer is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last segment is considered.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The function prints the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same integer, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Consecutive Segments Calculation:**
  - The function calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same integer, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the function will find the minimum segment length of 1, but removing one element does not make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
  - However, it does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`), which should also result in `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
- To determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, we need to:
  - Identify all segments where the operation can be applied.
  - Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove from these segments to break the pattern.
  - If no such segments exist, the array is already non-beautiful, and we should print `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same integer, which is not the same as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
