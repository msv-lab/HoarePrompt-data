The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- `i` is `n-1`
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`
- If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0
- If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop

The code snippet updates the value of `a` to a new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the new list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**
