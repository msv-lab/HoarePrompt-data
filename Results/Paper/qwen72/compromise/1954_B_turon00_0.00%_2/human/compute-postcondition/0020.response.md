Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp` (which it is, as `tmp` is set to `a[0]`), the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 1. Since `n` is an input integer and 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the value of `ans` will be 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
