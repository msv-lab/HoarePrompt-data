Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` was initially `n` and `cnt` was 1, so `ans` is now 1.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `ans` was initially 0 and `cnt` was 0, so `ans` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`, `_`, `aa`) retain their initial values.
