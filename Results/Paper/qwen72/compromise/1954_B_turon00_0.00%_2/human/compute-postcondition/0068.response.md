The code snippet `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `ans` will now hold the same value as `n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 0.**
