The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially 0 or 2 depending on the conditions, it will now be 1 or 3, respectively. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 1.**
