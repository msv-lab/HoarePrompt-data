Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`. `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the input integer provided by the user, which is constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `_`) remain unchanged, so the initial state for these variables is still valid. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value is not specified, we only note that it has been incremented.
