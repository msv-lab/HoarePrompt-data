Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop. After the code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` is executed, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, if the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`, if the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
