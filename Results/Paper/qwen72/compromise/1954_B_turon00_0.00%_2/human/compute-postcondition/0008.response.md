Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If the length of `aa` is 1, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` and its current length is 1.***
