The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.**
