Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, if the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`, if the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` remains the same.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed its specified number of iterations. The variable `n` will still be an input integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `a` will be the list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The list `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it meets the problem's requirements.

The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the inner loop completes, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The variable `tmp` will be equal to the first element of the list `a` (`a[0]`), and `aa` will be a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.

If the list `a` contains only one unique element (i.e., `len(aa) == 1`), then `ans` will be `n` and `cnt` will be `n`, as the loop will print `-1` for such cases. If the list `a` contains more than one unique element, `ans` will be the minimum value observed during the loop for the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`, and `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.

The loop will have printed the value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases, and the final state of the variables will reflect the last iteration of the loop.
