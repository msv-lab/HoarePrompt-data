Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The key insight is that Alice and Bob will play in such a way that they will try to control the presence of the smallest integers in the array `c`.

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve this problem by calculating the frequency of each integer in the array `arr` and then determining the smallest integer `i` that either:
1. Has a frequency of 1 and is the second such integer encountered.
2. Has a frequency of 0.

This approach is based on the idea that:
- If an integer `i` has a frequency of 0, it is the smallest integer not in the array, which is the MEX.
- If an integer `i` has a frequency of 1 and is the second such integer encountered, it means that the smallest integer that can be added to `c` to maximize the MEX is `i`.

However, the logic in the function is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Specifically:
- The function does not account for the turn-based nature of the game.
- The function does not simulate the removal of elements from `arr` as the game progresses.
- The function does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, which involves Alice trying to add the smallest possible integers to `c` while Bob tries to prevent this.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to add the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is in `arr`, while Bob will try to remove the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is in `arr`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
    
    # Simulate the game
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            if freq[mex] == 1:
                freq[mex] = 0
                mex += 1
                while mex <= n and freq[mex] > 0:
                    mex += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            if freq[mex] == 1:
                freq[mex] = 0
                while mex <= n and freq[mex] > 0:
                    mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

Given the flawed logic in the provided function, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
