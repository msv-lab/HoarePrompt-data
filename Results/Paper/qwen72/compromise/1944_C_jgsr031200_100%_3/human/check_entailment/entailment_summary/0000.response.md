Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from the array `a` until it is empty. Alice appends the elements she picks to an array `c`, and the goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` has a frequency of 0, it is the MEX and is printed.
   - If an integer `i` has a frequency of 1, Alice can pick it to ensure it is included in `c`, and Bob will not be able to pick it. The function counts such integers.
   - If two such integers (with a frequency of 1) are encountered, the function prints the second one, as Alice can pick the first one and Bob will be forced to pick the second one, ensuring the MEX is `i`.

4. **Behavior of the Function**:
   - The function correctly identifies the MEX by checking the frequency of each integer.
   - It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the frequency of elements and the order in which they are picked.
   - The function prints the correct MEX for the given examples:
     - For `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, the MEX is 2.
     - For `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is 1.
     - For `arr = [1, 1]`, the MEX is 0.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all integers are present in `arr` and have a frequency of 1 or more.
   - It correctly identifies the first missing integer (MEX) and prints it.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function runs in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
