Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the optimal MEX score for the game. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Frequency Counting**: The program first counts the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1`. This is necessary because the MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, and the elements in `arr` are guaranteed to be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, the optimal strategy involves Alice trying to include as many unique elements as possible in the array `c` while Bob tries to prevent this by removing elements that Alice might need.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The program iterates through the `freq` list to find the smallest integer `i` such that:
   - `freq[i] == 0` (i.e., `i` is not in the array `arr` at all).
   - Or, `freq[i] == 1` and this is the second unique element Alice can add to `c` (since Alice can only add one element per turn, and Bob will remove one element per turn).

4. **Breaking the Loop**: The loop breaks and prints the current index `i` as the MEX when either of the above conditions is met. This ensures that the MEX is correctly determined based on the optimal play strategy of both players.

The program handles the constraints and multiple test cases correctly, and the logic for determining the MEX is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
