Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequency of elements, which does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints 4 as the MEX, but the correct MEX should be 1 if both players play optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:

1. Alice picks 1, `a = [0, 2, 3]`, `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks 2, `a = [3]`, `c = [1, 2]`.
4. Bob picks 3, `a = []`, `c = [1, 2]`.

At the end, `c = [1, 2]`, and the MEX of `c` is 0, but since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, the MEX should be 1. The program fails to simulate the game correctly and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
