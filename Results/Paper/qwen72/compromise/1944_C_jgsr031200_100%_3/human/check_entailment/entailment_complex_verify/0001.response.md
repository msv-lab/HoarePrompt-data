### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, and the game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice and Bob are taking turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Alice can choose any element from `a` and add it to `c`, while Bob can only delete an element from `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that Alice might need to construct a higher MEX.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided program calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n` to find the MEX.
   - If an element appears at least twice, it can be ignored because Alice can always choose one of the duplicates.
   - If an element appears exactly once, it is counted.
   - If two elements appear exactly once or if an element does not appear at all, the MEX is found and printed.

5. **Code Breakdown:**
   - **Frequency Calculation:**
     ```python
     freq = [0] * (n + 1)
     for i in arr:
         freq[i] += 1
     ```
     This correctly calculates the frequency of each element in `arr`.

   - **Finding the MEX:**
     ```python
     cou = 0
     for i in range(n + 1):
         if freq[i] >= 2:
             continue
         if freq[i] == 1:
             cou += 1
         if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
             print(i)
             break
     ```
     - The loop iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n`.
     - If an element appears at least twice, it is ignored.
     - If an element appears exactly once, it is counted.
     - If two elements appear exactly once or if an element does not appear at all, the MEX is found and printed.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The strategy of ignoring elements that appear at least twice and counting elements that appear exactly once is optimal.
   - The MEX is correctly determined by the first value that either does not appear or is the second unique value.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the Program Before the Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

- **State After Frequency Calculation:**
  - `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `arr`. The length of `freq` remains `n + 1`.

- **State After Finding the MEX:**
  - `i` is the index where the loop prints and breaks.
  - `cou` is either 0, 1, or 2.
  - `freq` remains unchanged.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Frequency Calculation:**
  - The frequency calculation is correct. It creates a list `freq` of size `n + 1` and increments the count for each element in `arr`.

- **Finding the MEX:**
  - The loop iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n`.
  - Elements that appear at least twice are ignored, which is correct because Alice can always choose one of the duplicates.
  - Elements that appear exactly once are counted. The variable `cou` keeps track of the number of such elements.
  - The loop breaks and prints the MEX when either:
    - Two elements appear exactly once (`cou == 2`).
    - An element does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The annotations and the original assessment are consistent with the correct behavior of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
