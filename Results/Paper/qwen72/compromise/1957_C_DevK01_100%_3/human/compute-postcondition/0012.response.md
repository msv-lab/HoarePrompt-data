The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function returns the value of `dp[n-1]`, which is the second element in the list `dp` representing the dynamic programming state for the (n-1)th position on the chessboard.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard and returns the dynamic programming state for the (n-1)th position on the chessboard.**
