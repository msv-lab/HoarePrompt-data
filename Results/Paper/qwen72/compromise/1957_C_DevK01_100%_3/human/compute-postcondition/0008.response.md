Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with three elements: [3, 7, 13]; `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `dp` initially contains two elements: [3, 7].
- The new element added to `dp` is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- Substituting the values, `dp[-1]` is 7, `dp[-2]` is 3, and `i` is 3.
- The expression becomes `(7 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 3) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `(7 + 2 * 2 * 3) % 1000000007` = `(7 + 12) % 1000000007` = `19 % 1000000007` = `19`.
- Since `19` is less than `1000000007`, the result is `19`.
- The new element `19` is appended to `dp`, making it [3, 7, 19].
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
