Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with three elements: [1, 1, 3]; `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1, and `i` is 2.
- The code snippet `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]` appends a new element to the `dp` list.
- The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- `dp[-1]` is 1 (the last element of `dp`).
- `dp[-2]` is 1 (the second last element of `dp`).
- `2 * (i - 1)` is `2 * (2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * 1 = 2`.
- Therefore, the new element is `(1 + 2 * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which simplifies to `(1 + 2) % 1000000007 = 3 % 1000000007 = 3`.
- The `dp` list is updated to `[1, 1, 3]`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
