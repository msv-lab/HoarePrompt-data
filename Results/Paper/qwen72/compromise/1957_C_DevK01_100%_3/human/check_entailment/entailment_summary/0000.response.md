### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game where you and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the transposed position.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \) already made.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to update the size of the remaining valid positions on the board.

3. **Move Processing**:
   - For each move, if the row and column indices are different (\( a \neq b \)), both the row and column are blocked, reducing the number of valid positions by 2.
   - If the row and column indices are the same (\( a = b \)), only one position is blocked, reducing the number of valid positions by 1.
   - This logic is correctly implemented in the program.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining valid positions using dynamic programming.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, representing the base cases for 0 and 1 remaining positions.
   - The DP transition is correctly defined as:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]
     \]
     This transition accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the two possible ways to place the rook in the remaining positions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations possible.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of different final configurations. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
