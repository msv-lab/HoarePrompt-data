Output State: **`n` is an input integer, no other variables are affected.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `n` and confirms that no other variables are affected.
