The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are non-negative integers, and they must satisfy the condition 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. The function returns the maximum sum that can be obtained by selecting a subarray within the indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) of the list `a`.
