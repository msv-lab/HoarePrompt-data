### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r` (i.e., the subarray is a single element), it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If so, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
     - It calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, initializes the array `a`, and calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results as required by the problem statement.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function Definitions and Calls:**
     - The original assessment correctly identified that the `recursive_maximize_sum` function and `func_1` function need to correctly pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
     - The provided program does not pass `a` and `ops` correctly to `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_1`, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The MEX value is not explicitly calculated in the provided program. Instead, the program sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is the length of the subarray. This is not always the correct MEX value.
     - For example, if the subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`, the MEX value should be `0`, but the program sets it to `3`.

   - **Sum Maximization:**
     - The program's logic for sum maximization is flawed. It does not correctly identify the MEX value and apply it to the subarray.
     - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is used to decide whether to apply the MEX operation, but this condition does not necessarily ensure that the MEX value is the correct one to maximize the sum.

   - **Recursive Calls:**
     - The recursive calls in `recursive_maximize_sum` are not correctly splitting the subarray around the maximum value. This can lead to incorrect subarray processing and potentially infinite recursion in some cases.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly calculate the MEX value and apply it to the subarray.
   - The recursive logic is flawed and can lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion.
   - The program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues with MEX calculation, recursive logic, and function argument passing. The corrected program should explicitly calculate the MEX value and ensure that the recursive calls are handled correctly.
