### Reasoning:

1. **Original Assessment Points:**
   - **NameError Issue:** The original assessment correctly points out that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required for `func_1` to append operations. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - **MEX Calculation Issue:** The original assessment also correctly identifies that the program does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The MEX operation should set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. However, the program sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0.
     - The function recursively processes the sublist from `l + 1` to `r` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If so, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`.
     - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. The function sets `a[i]` to `r - l + 1`, which is not the MEX of the subarray.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the initial indices of the list `a`.
     - The function returns the sum of the modified list `a`, the length of `ops`, and the list `ops` itself.
     - The function does not pass `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is a critical error.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - The function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` and checks if it is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray.
     - If the condition is met, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`.
     - If the condition is not met, it recursively processes the subarrays before and after the maximum element in `a[l:r + 1]`.
     - The function does not accept or pass the `ops` list, which is a critical error.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - The function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
     - The function correctly prints the sum and the number of operations, as well as the operations themselves.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The program has a **NameError** because `ops` is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.
   - The specific case provided in the original assessment (input: `4\n1 2 3 4`) will indeed fail because the program sets the values to `r - l + 1` instead of the MEX.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the MEX operation correctly and has a scope issue with the `ops` list, leading to a `NameError`. These issues prevent the program from producing the correct output for all valid inputs.
