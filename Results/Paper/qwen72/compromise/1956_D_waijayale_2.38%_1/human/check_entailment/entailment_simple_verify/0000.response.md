### Reasoning:

1. **Scope Issue with `ops` List**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the `ops` list is not being passed to the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. This is a critical issue because `recursive_maximize_sum` needs to modify the `ops` list, which is used to store the operations performed.
   - In the current implementation, `recursive_maximize_sum` does not have access to the `ops` list, leading to a `NameError` when it tries to append to `ops`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies that the program does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The MEX operation should set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.
   - However, the program sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is the length of the subarray. This is not the correct MEX value and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Specific Example**:
   - The provided example:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       10 1
       1 4
       ```
     - Actual Output:
       - The program will likely raise an error due to the scope issue with `ops`.
       - Even if `ops` were correctly passed, the MEX calculation would be incorrect, leading to an incorrect result.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, but they do not address the fundamental issues with the MEX calculation and the scope of the `ops` list.
   - The annotations confirm that the program is setting values to `r - l + 1` and not to the MEX of the subarray.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Specifically, the `ops` list is not being passed correctly, and the MEX calculation is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
