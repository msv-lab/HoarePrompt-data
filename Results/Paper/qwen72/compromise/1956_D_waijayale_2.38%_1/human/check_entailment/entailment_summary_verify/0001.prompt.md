You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of an array `a`. It then reads `a` as a list of `n` integers from the input. The function calls another function `func_2` with the array `a` and receives three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, where `s` is the sum of some elements in `a` and `m` is the maximum or minimum value of some elements in `a`. Additionally, it prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`. The function does not return any values. The original values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged after the function concludes.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r` (i.e., the subarray is a single element), it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If so, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the array `a` and the list of operations `ops`.
     - It calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function is called recursively to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, initializes the array `a`, and calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results as required by the problem statement.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The MEX value is correctly identified and applied to the subarray.
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The program correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is also not defined correctly. It should take the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments.
   - The function `func_2` should pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

5. **Corrected Program:**

   ```python
   def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
       if l == r:
           if a[l] != 0:
               ops.append((l, l))
               a[l] = 0
           return
       func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
       if a[l] != r - l + 1:
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
           func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

   def func_2(a):
       n = len(a)
       ops = []

       def recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
           s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
           if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
               func_1(a, l, r, ops)
               ops.append((l, r))
               for i in range(l, r + 1):
                   a[i] = r - l + 1
           else:
               mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
               pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
               if pos != l:
                   recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, pos - 1, ops)
               if pos != r:
                   recursive_maximize_sum(a, pos + 1, r, ops)

       recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
       return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

   def func_3():
       n = int(input())
       a = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
       print(s, m)
       for (l, r) in ops:
           print(l + 1, r + 1)
   ```

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has issues with the function definitions and the way they are called. Specifically, the `recursive_maximize_sum` function and `func_1` function need to correctly pass the array `a` and the list of operations `ops` as arguments. The corrected program should work as intended.
