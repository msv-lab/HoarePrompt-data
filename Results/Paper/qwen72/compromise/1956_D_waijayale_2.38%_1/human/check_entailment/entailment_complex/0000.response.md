Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to set a segment of the array `a` from index `l` to `r` to a specific value, which is `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If `l` equals `r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - The function appends the operations to the `ops` list, which is used to track the changes made to the array.
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `l` equals `r` and the recursive case where `l` is not equal to `r`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array `a`.
   - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The function correctly sets up the initial state for the recursive function and returns the final state as required.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is the core of the solution, which recursively maximizes the sum of the array `a` by applying the MEX operation.
   - It checks if the sum of the current segment is less than or equal to the square of the segment length. If so, it applies the MEX operation and updates the segment.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the segment and recursively applies the MEX operation to the subsegments before and after the maximum element.
   - The function correctly handles the recursive splitting of the array and the application of the MEX operation.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results.
   - It correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the output in the required format.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array by applying the MEX operation no more than 5 * 10^5 times.
   - The functions work together to achieve the goal, and the final output matches the problem requirements.
   - The program handles all edge cases and valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
