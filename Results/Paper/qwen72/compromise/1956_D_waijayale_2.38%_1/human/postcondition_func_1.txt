The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a tuple containing three elements: the sum of all integers in `a`, the length of the list `ops`, and the list `ops` itself. The list `ops` may have been modified by the internal function `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is called with the initial indices of the list `a`. The function does not alter the input list `a`.
