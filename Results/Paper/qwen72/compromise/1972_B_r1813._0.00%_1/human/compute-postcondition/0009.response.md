Output State: **`index` is `1 + 2 * t`. `t` remains the same as the initial value. `results` is a list of strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the count of 'U' in each `s` is odd or even, respectively.** 

The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element, but it does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `index`, `t`, and `results` remains unchanged after the loop has finished executing.
