Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`.
   - If `res` is '=', then `res` is set to '=' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
   - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `res` remains not '<' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `maxi` or any information about the loop execution. Therefore, `maxi` is unknown.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`. Based on the initial state:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`, so `arr[0]` is 1.
     - If `res` is '=', then `res` is set to '=' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`, so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `res` remains not '<' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`, so `arr[0]` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is repeated in the print statement, so its value will be the same as the first occurrence.
   - The `flush=True` parameter is used to ensure the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `arr` is `[1]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 1.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 1, maxi, 2, flush=True)`.
   - If `res` is '=':
     - `res` is set to '=' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 0, maxi, 2, flush=True)`.
   - If `res` is not '<' and not '=':
     - `res` remains not '<' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 0, maxi, 2, flush=True)`.

Since `maxi` is unknown, we can only describe it as `maxi` in the output. The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`, but it will be either 1 or 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     Output: **? maxi 1 maxi 2**
   - If `res` is '=' or not '<':
     Output: **? maxi 0 maxi 2**

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? maxi [arr[0]] maxi 2 (where maxi is the largest integer i for which res was '<' during the loop execution, and arr[0] is 1 if res is '<', or 0 if res is '=' or not '<')**
