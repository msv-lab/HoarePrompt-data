Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
   - `item` is the last element in `arr`, which is `n-1`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.
   - `res` is the input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is either 0 or 2, depending on the value of `res`.
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and then the value of `i` twice.
   - Since `i` is 3, the last two values will always be 3.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', the output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `res` is not '<', the output will be: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where [maxi] is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise [maxi] is 0)**
