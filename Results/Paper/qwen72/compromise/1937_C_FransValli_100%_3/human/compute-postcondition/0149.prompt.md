Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        maxi = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is 3 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` is 2, `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
