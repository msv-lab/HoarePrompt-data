Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.**

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `maxi` depends on the new value of `res` as specified in the initial state.
