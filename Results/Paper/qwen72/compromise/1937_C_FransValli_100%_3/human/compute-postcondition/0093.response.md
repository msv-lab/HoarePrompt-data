Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `res` is '='.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` was `[0]`, so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. The values of `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res` remain unchanged.
