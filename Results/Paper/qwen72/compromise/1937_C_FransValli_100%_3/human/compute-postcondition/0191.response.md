Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is `arr[2]`, `item` is `arr[2]`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to be the same as `item`, which is `arr[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
