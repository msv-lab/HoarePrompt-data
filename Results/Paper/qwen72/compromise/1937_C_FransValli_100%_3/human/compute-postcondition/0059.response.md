Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `arr` is a list containing at least four elements.
- `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
- `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.
- `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mini`**: This variable is the third element of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list containing at least four elements, `mini` will be the value of `arr[2]`.
2. **`item`**: This variable is the fourth element of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list containing at least four elements, `item` will be the value of `arr[3]`.
3. **`flush=True`**: This is an optional parameter in the `print` function that ensures the output is immediately flushed to the console, which is not relevant to the content being printed.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.

Output: **? [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] (where [arr[2]] is the third element of the list `arr` and [arr[3]] is the fourth element of the list `arr`)**
