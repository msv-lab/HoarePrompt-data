Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is 3 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` is 2, `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3.
- If `res` is '<', `maxi` was initially 2, and now it is 3.
- If `res` is not '<', `maxi` remains 2.
- `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `item`, `_`, `res`) retain their initial values or conditions.
