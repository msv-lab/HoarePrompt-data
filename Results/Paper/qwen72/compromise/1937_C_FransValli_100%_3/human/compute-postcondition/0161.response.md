The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `res` is an input string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is [1]. If `res` is '=', `arr` is [1]. Otherwise, `arr` is not modified.**
