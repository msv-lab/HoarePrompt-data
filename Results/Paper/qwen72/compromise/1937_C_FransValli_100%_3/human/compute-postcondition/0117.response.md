Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1 and `item` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` and `item` remain unchanged.***
