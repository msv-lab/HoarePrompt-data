To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` at 1 and iterates up to `n-1`. However, the state before the loop starts indicates that `i` is already `n-1`. This needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 for the loop to execute correctly.

2. **Variable `n`**: The state indicates that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This is already a valid condition for the loop to execute, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

3. **Variable `maxi`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

4. **Variable `arr`**: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes correctly is:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is [0]**
