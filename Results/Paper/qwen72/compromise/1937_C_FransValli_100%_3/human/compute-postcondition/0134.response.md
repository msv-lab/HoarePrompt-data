Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
- `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.
- `item` is the last element in `arr`, which is `n-1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `arr` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. For example, if `n` is 5, `arr` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- `maxi` is 0, which is the initial value.
- `i` is 1, which is the initial value.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- The next two values are `maxi`, which is 0.
- The next two values are `i`, which is 1.
- The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `?`
- The value of `maxi` (which is 0) twice
- The value of `i` (which is 1) twice

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
