Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`.
   - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - `res` is now the input value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - **`res`**: The value of `res` is provided as the input value. We need to consider the different cases for `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
     - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.

   - **`maxi`**: The value of `maxi` depends on the loop execution, but since we don't have the loop details, we can only describe it based on the given information. `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.

   - **`arr[0]`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`. Based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr[0]` is 2.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr[0]` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr[0]` is 0.

   - **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 3.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - **Case 1: `res` is '<'**
     - `arr` is `[2]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 2.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 2, maxi, 3, flush=True)`.
     - Output: **? maxi 2 maxi 3**

   - **Case 2: `res` is '='**
     - `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 0, maxi, 3, flush=True)`.
     - Output: **? maxi 0 maxi 3**

   - **Case 3: `res` is not '<' and not '='**
     - `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', maxi, 0, maxi, 3, flush=True)`.
     - Output: **? maxi 0 maxi 3**

Since the value of `maxi` is not explicitly provided and depends on the loop execution, we can only describe it as the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.

Therefore, the final output based on the given initial state and the print statement is:

Output: **? maxi [arr[0]] maxi 3 (where maxi is the largest integer i for which res was '<' during the loop execution, and arr[0] is the first element of arr)**

- If `res` is '<', then `arr[0]` is 2.
- If `res` is '=' or not '<', then `arr[0]` is 0.
