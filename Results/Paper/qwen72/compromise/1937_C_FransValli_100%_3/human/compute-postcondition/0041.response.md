Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string. `arr` is [3].**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `arr`.
- Since `i` is 3, `arr` becomes [3].
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `res` being '<', '=', or not '<' or '=' do not affect the current assignment to `arr`, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
