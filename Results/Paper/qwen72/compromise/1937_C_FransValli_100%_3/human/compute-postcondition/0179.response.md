Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is `arr[0]`, `item` is 0, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the input string.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `item`, and `_`.
- The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input string, which is provided by the user.
