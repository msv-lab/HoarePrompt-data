Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string, `arr` is [2] if `res` is '<' or '=', otherwise `arr` is [2].**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 2) to `arr`. Since `i` is 2, `arr` becomes [2] regardless of the value of `res`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
