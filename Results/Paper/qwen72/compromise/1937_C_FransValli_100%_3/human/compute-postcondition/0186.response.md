Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is `arr[1]`, `item` is `arr[1]`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. Since `item` was previously set to `arr[1]`, `mini` now holds the value of `arr[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
