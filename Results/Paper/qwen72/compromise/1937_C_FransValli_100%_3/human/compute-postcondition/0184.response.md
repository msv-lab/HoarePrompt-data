Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the input integer.
2. `i` is `n-1`.
3. `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
4. `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. The list `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
5. `mini` is 0.
6. `item` is `arr[1]`.
7. `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`.
8. `res` is the input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`mini`**: According to the initial state, `mini` is 0. Even if `res` is '>', `mini` is still 0 because the update to `mini` is only mentioned as a condition but not as a result of any operation that changes `mini` after the initial state.
2. **`item`**: `item` is defined as `arr[1]`. Since `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `item` will be the second element of the list `arr`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `mini` (which is 0), the value of `mini` again (which is 0), the value of `item` (which is `arr[1]`), and the value of `item` again (which is `arr[1]`).

Output: **? 0 0 [arr[1]] [arr[1]] (where [arr[1]] is the second element of the list `arr`)**
