The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `item`, so we can only adjust those. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `item` is `n-1` (the last element of `arr`). The list `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order. For the loop to execute one more time, `item` must be the next element in `arr[1:]`, which is the first element of `arr` after the first one (i.e., the second element of `arr`).

Since `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, the next `item` will be `n-2` (the second-to-last element of `arr`), and `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is `n-2`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is set to `n-1`.**
