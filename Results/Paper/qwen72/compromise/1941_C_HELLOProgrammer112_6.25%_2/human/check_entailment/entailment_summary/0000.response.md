Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them, but this approach is flawed because:

1. **Substrings vs. Characters**: The problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, not the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program counts 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", and outputs 2. However, the correct answer is 2, but the characters to be removed are the 4th and 9th characters, which are 'n' and 'e' respectively, to make the string "mmapapie".

2. **Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "ppiepieeee", the program counts 2 occurrences of "pie" and outputs 2. However, the correct answer is 2, but the characters to be removed are the 4th and 7th characters, which are 'i' and 'i' respectively, to make the string "pppieeee".

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program's logic is too simplistic and does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to avoid both "map" and "pie" substrings. It needs to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
