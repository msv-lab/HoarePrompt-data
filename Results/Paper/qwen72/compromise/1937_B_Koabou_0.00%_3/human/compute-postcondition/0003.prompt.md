Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ `n[i]` ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings `a1` and `a2` where `a1[i]` and `a2[i]` represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in `a1` and `a2` consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to `n[i]`. The sum of all `n[i]` values does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `a` is an empty list. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
