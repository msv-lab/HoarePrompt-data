The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2×n grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
