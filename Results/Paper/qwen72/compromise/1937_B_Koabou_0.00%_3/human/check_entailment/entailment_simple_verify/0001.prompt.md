You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 where a1[i] and a2[i] represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the first `n-1` columns to find the first position `i` where the grasshopper must jump downwards to avoid a '1' in the top row and land on a '0' in the bottom row.
   - If such a position is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to `i` and the suffix of the bottom row from `i` onwards.
   - If no such position is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last element of the bottom row.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will store the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates over the first `x` columns to find the first position `i` where the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the string `s`.
   - If such a position is found, it sets `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program ensures that the grasshopper jumps downwards at the first possible position to avoid a '1' in the top row and land on a '0' in the bottom row, which is the optimal strategy to minimize the string lexicographically.

- **Counting the Number of Paths:**
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is incorrect. The program sets `t` to `x - i + 1` when it finds a matching prefix, but this does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
  - The correct approach should be to count the number of positions where the grasshopper can jump downwards without changing the lexicographical order of the string. This can be done by counting the number of '0's in the top row up to the point where the grasshopper must jump downwards.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string.
- However, the program incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield this string.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to accurately count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
