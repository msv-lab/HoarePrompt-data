Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` should take the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples as parameters, but it currently takes no parameters and reads input directly within the function. This is a design flaw, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution for a single test case.

2. **Logic for Finding the First and Last 'B'**:
   - The variable `c` is used to find the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`. If a 'B' is found, `mi` is set to `c`, and the loop breaks.
   - The variable `d` is used to find the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` by iterating over the string in reverse. If a 'B' is found, `ma` is set to `len(s) - d`, and the loop breaks.
   - The function then returns `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Return Value Calculation**:
   - The return value `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` to get the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' inclusive.
   - If the strip contains only one 'B', the function should return 1, but the current implementation will return 2.

4. **Handling Cases with No 'B'**:
   - The problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so the function should always find at least one 'B'. However, the current implementation does not handle this guarantee correctly and will return 2 if no 'B' is found, which is not possible according to the problem constraints.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
