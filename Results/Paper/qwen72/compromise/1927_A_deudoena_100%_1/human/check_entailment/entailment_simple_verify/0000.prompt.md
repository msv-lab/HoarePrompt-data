You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

    BWBWWB

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found) + 1, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the program returns 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white when there are multiple segments of black cells that are not contiguous.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
WBBWWB
```
The correct output should be 3, as the minimum segment to paint is from the 2nd to the 4th cell (inclusive), which would turn the strip into "WWWWWW". However, the provided program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1()`. The program calculates the positions of the first and last black cells (`mi` and `ma` respectively) and then returns `ma - mi + 2`. This approach does not account for the possibility that the minimum segment to paint might be shorter if there are multiple segments of black cells that are not contiguous. The correct approach would be to find the first and last black cells and return the length of the segment between them, inclusive.
