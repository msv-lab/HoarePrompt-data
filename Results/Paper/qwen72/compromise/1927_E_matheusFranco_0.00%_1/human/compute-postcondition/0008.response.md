The code snippet calls the function `func_1()` once. Since `func_1()` has already been called twice according to the initial state, calling it again means it has now been called three times in total. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value between 1 and 10^4 - 2, `func_1()` has been called three times.**
