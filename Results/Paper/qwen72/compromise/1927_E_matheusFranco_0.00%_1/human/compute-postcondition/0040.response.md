Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The updated value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`, and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains `curr_v + 1`.
