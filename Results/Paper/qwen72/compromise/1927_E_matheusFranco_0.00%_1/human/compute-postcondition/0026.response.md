To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The condition involves `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given the current state, the loop will execute if `1 + k < n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should still be less than `len(permutation)` after the adjustment.
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k` and `len(permutation)` is `n`, no adjustment is needed if `1 + k < n` holds true.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute one more time, as `1 + k < n` is true given the constraints `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

### Final State:
Since no adjustments are needed, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 2`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`, `permutation[1]` is `n // k + 1`**
