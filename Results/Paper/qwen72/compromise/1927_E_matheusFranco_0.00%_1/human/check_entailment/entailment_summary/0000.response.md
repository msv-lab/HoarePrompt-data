### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
   - A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
     - Initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
     - Fills the permutation list such that elements at indices that are multiples of `k` are set to specific values based on the sequence.
     - Ensures that the remaining elements are filled with the next available values in the sequence.
     - Prints the permutation as a space-separated string.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - Ensures that `func_1` is called `t` times.

3. **Verification of k-Level Property**:
   - The key part of the problem is ensuring that the generated permutation is k-level.
   - The function `func_1` fills the permutation in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The approach of filling elements at multiples of `k` and then filling the rest ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly: `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.
   - The function also handles multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_1` `t` times.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. The approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, meeting the problem's requirements.
