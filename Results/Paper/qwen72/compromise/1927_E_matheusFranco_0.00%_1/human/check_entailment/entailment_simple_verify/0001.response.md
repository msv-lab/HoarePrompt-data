Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the permutation:
     - The outer loop iterates over the range of `k`.
     - The inner loop fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - The value `curr_v` is incremented and placed at these positions.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It runs a loop `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm ensures that the permutation is filled in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The key idea is to distribute the numbers in a pattern that maintains the required property. By placing numbers at positions that are multiples of `k`, the algorithm ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
   - The annotated code confirms that the permutation is constructed correctly, with `curr_v` being incremented and placed at the appropriate indices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the constraints well, including the edge cases where `k` is 2 and `n` is small.
   - The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed the limit, ensuring the algorithm is efficient.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the required format, printing the permutation as a space-separated string for each test case.
   - The annotated code provides a clear state of the program after the loops, confirming that the permutation is constructed as expected.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
