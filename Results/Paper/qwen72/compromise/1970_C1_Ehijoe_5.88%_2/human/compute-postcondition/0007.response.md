Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the second element is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `moves` is a list with two elements.
- The first element of `moves` is `min(t, idx)`, which is the minimum of `t` (which is 1) and `idx`.
- The second element of `moves` is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`, which is the minimum of `t` (which is 1) and `n - idx - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, `start`, `idx`) remain unchanged.
