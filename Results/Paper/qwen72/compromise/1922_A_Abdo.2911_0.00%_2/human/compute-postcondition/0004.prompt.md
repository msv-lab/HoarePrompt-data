You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
                ].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final state is that `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The variables `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` are not retained after each iteration, so they do not have a final state outside the loop. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
