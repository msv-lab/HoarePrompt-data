Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, n, a, b, c):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
