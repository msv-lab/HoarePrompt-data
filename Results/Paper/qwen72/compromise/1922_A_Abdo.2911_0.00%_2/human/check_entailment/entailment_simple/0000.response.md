### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i].upper()` (uppercase).

2. **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template:**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the template.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it must match the corresponding character in `a` and `b`.
     - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` and `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Matching `c` to the Template:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The construction of the template is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should be lowercase and match both `a` and `b`. If they are different, the template should be uppercase to ensure that both `a` and `b` do not match the lowercase version of the template.

- **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template:**
  - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template is correct. The program ensures that for each position, the conditions are met.

- **Matching `c` to the Template:**
  - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template is incorrect. The program should ensure that `c` does not match the template in the same way that `a` and `b` do. However, the current implementation has a logical error:
    - If the template character is uppercase, the program incorrectly checks if `c[i]` matches the lowercase version of the template character. This is the opposite of what is required. The correct condition should be that `c[i]` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the `match_c` check. The corrected program ensures that `c` does not match the template correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
