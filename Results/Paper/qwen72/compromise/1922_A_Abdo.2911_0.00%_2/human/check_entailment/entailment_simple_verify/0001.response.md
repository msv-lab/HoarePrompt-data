### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `t` based on the following rules:
     - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to that character.
     - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of the character from `a`.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
   - The check for `a` and `b` matching the template is correct. The program ensures that if the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match it. If the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Matching Check for `c`:**
   - The check for `c` not matching the template is incorrect. The program should ensure that if the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match it. If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character. However, the current implementation breaks the loop as soon as it finds a match, which is incorrect. It should break the loop only if it finds a position where `c` matches the template.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The logic for constructing the template is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template is set to that lowercase character. If they are different, the template is set to an uppercase character that is not the lowercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

- **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
  - The check for `a` and `b` matching the template is correct. It ensures that for each position `i`:
    - If the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as the template character.
    - If the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.

- **Matching Check for `c`:**
  - The check for `c` not matching the template is flawed. The program should ensure that for each position `i`:
    - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not be the same as the template character.
    - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.
  - The current implementation incorrectly breaks the loop as soon as it finds a match, which means it might incorrectly conclude that `c` matches the template if it finds a single position where `c` matches the template.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed matching check for `c`. The corrected program ensures that `c` does not match the template in all positions, which is necessary for the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
