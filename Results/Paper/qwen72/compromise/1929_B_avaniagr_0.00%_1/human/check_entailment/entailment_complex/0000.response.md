### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming problems.
   - The function processes each line of input to extract `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Formula Used**:
   - The formula used to calculate the minimum number of cells to color is:
     ```python
     (k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
     ```
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `k // 2 + k % 2` calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`. This is the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least `k` diagonals when `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.
     - `(k < 4 * n - 3)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false. It ensures that the first part of the formula is used only when `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.
     - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` calculates `2 * n` when `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`. This is the number of cells needed to cover all diagonals when `k` is close to the maximum.
     - `(k == 4 * n - 2)` is a boolean expression that adds 1 to the result if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The formula correctly handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, which requires all cells to be colored.
   - The formula also correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, which is the most common scenario.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement to output a single integer for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the given problem description and constraints. The formula used is appropriate and handles all edge cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
