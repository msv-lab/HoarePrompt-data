You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each line, calculates a value based on the given formula, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the calculated results have been printed for each pair of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the input.
   - For each test case, it parses the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then calculates the minimum number of cells to be colored using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]

3. **Breaking Down the Formula:**
   - **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**
     - The formula \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) is used to calculate the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals.
     - \( k // 2 \) gives the integer division of \( k \) by 2.
     - \( k \% 2 \) gives the remainder of \( k \) divided by 2, which is 1 if \( k \) is odd and 0 if \( k \) is even.
     - This ensures that if \( k \) is odd, one additional cell is colored to cover the extra diagonal.
   - **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**
     - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \), the formula \( 2n \) is used.
     - This is because to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells along the main and anti-diagonals, which requires \( 2n \) cells.
   - **Case 3: \( k == 4n - 2 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the formula adds 1 to the result.
     - This is because covering all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals requires one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true (4 < 10).
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 2 \).
     - Result: 2.
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true (3 < 10).
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 2 \).
     - Result: 2.
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**
     - \( k \geq 4n - 3 \) is true (10 >= 10).
     - \( 2n = 6 \).
     - Result: 6.
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**
     - \( k \geq 4n - 3 \) is true (9 >= 10).
     - \( 2n = 6 \).
     - Result: 5 (since \( k == 4n - 2 \) is false, the additional 1 is not added).
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true (7 < 13).
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 4 \).
     - Result: 4.
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true (11 < 25).
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 6 \).
     - Result: 6.
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true (3 < 5).
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 2 \).
     - Result: 2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The formula correctly handles the different cases and produces the expected results for the given examples.
