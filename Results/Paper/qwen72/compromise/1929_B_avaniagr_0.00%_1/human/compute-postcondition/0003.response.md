Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each line, calculates a value based on the given formula, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the calculated results have been printed for each pair of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value. **
