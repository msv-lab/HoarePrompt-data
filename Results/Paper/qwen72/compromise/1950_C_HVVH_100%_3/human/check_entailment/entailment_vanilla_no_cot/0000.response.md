Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including handling the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading a time in 24-hour format.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it converts to 12 AM.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the period to PM.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it sets the period to PM.
   - For all other hours (1 to 11), it sets the period to AM.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the time in the correct 12-hour format, ensuring that hours and minutes are zero-padded to two digits.

The program handles all the edge cases and correctly formats the output as required by the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
