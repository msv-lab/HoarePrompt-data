The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a` and the string `s`. `m` is a positive integer. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, where `b` is derived from `a` based on the operations specified by `s`.
