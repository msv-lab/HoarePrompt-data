### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario, so the sum of all points must be even).

2. **Calculation of Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the total number of points as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is because each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The program then calculates the minimum of this total number of points and the sum of the two smallest scores `(a + b)`. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the number of points the two lowest-scoring players can contribute to the total score.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of the two values calculated in the previous step, which is the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Odd Sum Case:**
  - If the sum of the scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules, so printing `-1` is correct.

- **Even Sum Case:**
  - The total number of points `(a + b + c) // 2` represents the maximum possible number of games played.
  - The sum of the two smallest scores `(a + b)` represents the maximum number of draws that the two lowest-scoring players could have contributed to the total score.
  - The minimum of these two values is the maximum number of draws that could have happened, as it ensures that the total number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played and that the two lowest-scoring players' points are not overcounted.

### Example Verification:

- **Input: `0 0 0`**
  - Sum is `0`, which is even.
  - Total points: `0 // 2 = 0`.
  - Sum of two smallest scores: `0 + 0 = 0`.
  - Output: `min(0, 0) = 0`.

- **Input: `0 1 1`**
  - Sum is `2`, which is even.
  - Total points: `2 // 2 = 1`.
  - Sum of two smallest scores: `0 + 1 = 1`.
  - Output: `min(1, 1) = 1`.

- **Input: `1 1 1`**
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Input: `1 1 2`**
  - Sum is `4`, which is even.
  - Total points: `4 // 2 = 2`.
  - Sum of two smallest scores: `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Output: `min(2, 2) = 2`.

- **Input: `3 3 3`**
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Input: `3 4 5`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - Total points: `12 // 2 = 6`.
  - Sum of two smallest scores: `3 + 4 = 7`.
  - Output: `min(6, 7) = 6`.

- **Input: `1 1 10`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - Total points: `12 // 2 = 6`.
  - Sum of two smallest scores: `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Output: `min(6, 2) = 2`.
