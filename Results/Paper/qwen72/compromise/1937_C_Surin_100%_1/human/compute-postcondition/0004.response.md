The function `func` operates within an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a secret permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The function can make at most 3n queries to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` (the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`) is maximized. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` being a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.
