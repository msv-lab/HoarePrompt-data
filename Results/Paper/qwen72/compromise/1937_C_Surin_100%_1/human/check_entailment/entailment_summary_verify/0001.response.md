### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries, each of which compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The queries are in the form \( ? \, a \, b \, c \, d \), and the response is one of "<", ">", or "=".

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) of the largest value in the permutation \( p \) by comparing \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - This is done using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \), which effectively compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \). If \( p_i \) is greater, \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is greater than \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is equal to \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), an additional query \( ? \, i \, i \, prev \, prev \) is made to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \). If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After finding the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the answer.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - The second loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the two indices and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR by comparing all possible values.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Finding \( v1 \):**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) of the largest value in the permutation \( p \). This is because the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \) compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \), and if \( p_i \) is larger, \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).

- **Finding \( prev \):**
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized. This is because the query \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \) compares \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \). If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is greater, \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).
  - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is equal to \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), an additional query \( ? \, i \, i \, prev \, prev \) is made to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \). If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

- **Query Count:**
  - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) in the correct format \( ! \, prev \, v1 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. The logic and the number of queries are within the constraints of the problem.
