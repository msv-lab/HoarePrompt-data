### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries, each of which compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The response to each query is either '<', '>', or '='.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) of the largest value in the permutation \( p \) by comparing \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - This is done using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \), which effectively compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is greater than \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Handling Equal Values:**
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is equal to \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), the program makes an additional query to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \).
   - If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After finding the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - The second loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the two indices and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR by comparing all possible values.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Finding \( v1 \):**
  - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \).
  - If the response is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).
  - This loop correctly identifies the index of the largest value in the permutation \( p \).

- **Finding \( prev \):**
  - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \).
  - If the response is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).
  - If the response is '=', it makes an additional query \( ? \, i \, i \, prev \, prev \) to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \).
  - If the response to the additional query is '<', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).

- **Correctness of the Strategy:**
  - The strategy of finding \( v1 \) and then \( prev \) is sound. By comparing \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), the program ensures that \( prev \) is the index that maximizes \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \).
  - The additional query for handling equal values ensures that the program correctly updates \( prev \) when necessary.

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
  - The second loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries, and in the worst case, it makes an additional \( n-1 \) queries for handling equal values.
  - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \) in the worst case, which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. The logic and the number of queries are within the constraints of the problem.
