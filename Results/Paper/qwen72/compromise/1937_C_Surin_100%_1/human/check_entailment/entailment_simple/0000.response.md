### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries of the form \( "? a b c d" \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **First Loop:**
   - The first loop initializes \( v1 \) to 0 and iterates through the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - For each \( i \), it queries \( "? v1 v1 i i" \) to compare \( p_v1 \) and \( p_i \).
   - If the response is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \). This ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \( p \).

3. **Second Loop:**
   - The second loop initializes \( prev \) to 0 and iterates through the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - For each \( i \), it queries \( "? v1 i v1 prev" \) to compare \( (p_v1 \mid p_i) \) and \( (p_v1 \mid p_{prev}) \).
   - If the response is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \). This ensures that \( prev \) is the index of the value that, when ORed with \( p_v1 \), gives a value greater than \( p_v1 \).
   - If the response is '=', it further queries \( "? i i prev prev" \) to compare \( p_i \) and \( p_{prev} \). If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), it updates \( prev \) to \( i \). This ensures that \( prev \) is the index of the value that, when ORed with \( p_v1 \), gives the same result as \( p_{prev} \), but \( p_i \) itself is smaller.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loops, it prints \( "! prev v1" \) as the final answer.
   - This output is based on the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) which are expected to maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and logic. It uses the queries to find the maximum value in the permutation and then finds the index that, when ORed with this maximum value, gives the desired result. The final output is based on these indices, and the query count is within the allowed limit.

**Correctness: True**
