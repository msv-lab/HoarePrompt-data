Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1)` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, `res` is a list of tuples with one additional tuple `(start_index, start_index + (i - 1))` appended, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is now `i - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which means `i` is decremented by 1.
- The elements in the list `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1)` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`.
- The tuple `(start_index, start_index + (i - 1))` is appended to the list `res`.
- The value of `i` is now `i - 1`.
- The values of `start_index`, `arr`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged except for the updates mentioned above.
