Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, `is_already_stairs` is False, `i` is now `i - 1`, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but the other variables (`start_index`, `arr`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs`) remain unchanged. The condition that at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index still holds, and `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `arr[start_index + i]` is still not equal to `i`.
