The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers within the bounds of a list `arr`. It returns the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a specific calculation involving elements of `arr` and recursive calls to `func_1`. If the result for the given `start_index` and `end_index` is already cached in the dictionary `res_dict`, it returns the cached value. If `start_index` is equal to `end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index` in `arr`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value by considering the initial square of the range length and the results of recursive calls, and stores this value in `res_dict` before returning it.
