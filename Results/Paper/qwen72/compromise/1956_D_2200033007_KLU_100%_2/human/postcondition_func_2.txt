The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies the list `arr` and the list of tuples `res`. If the elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` form a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, the function returns `None` without making any changes. Otherwise, it ensures that all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`, and appends the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `arr` is modified to form a "staircase" pattern, and `res` contains tuples representing the ranges of indices that were modified.
