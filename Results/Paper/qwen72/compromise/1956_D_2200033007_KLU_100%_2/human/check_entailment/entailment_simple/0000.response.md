Reasoning:

The program is designed to maximize the sum of the elements of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The core of the solution is to use dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible sum and to reconstruct the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

1. **Dynamic Programming (func_1):**
   - `func_1(start_index, end_index)` computes the maximum sum for the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
   - The function uses memoization (via `res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If `start_index == end_index`, the function returns `max(1, arr[start_index])` because the MEX of a single-element subarray is either 1 (if the element is 0) or the element itself (if it is greater than 0).
   - For subarrays with more than one element, the function tries different splits and computes the maximum possible sum by recursively calling itself for the left and right subarrays and adding the middle element.
   - The function also considers the possibility of setting the entire subarray to the MEX of the subarray, which is represented by `length ** 2` (where `length` is the number of elements in the subarray).

2. **Reconstructing the Operations (func_2):**
   - `func_2(start_index, end_index)` reconstructs the sequence of operations that lead to the maximum sum.
   - If the subarray has only one element and it is greater than 0, no operation is needed.
   - If the subarray has only one element and it is 0, the operation is to set the element to 1.
   - If the maximum value for the subarray is `length ** 2`, the function sets the entire subarray to the MEX (which is `length`), and appends the operation to the result list.
   - Otherwise, the function tries to find the split that achieves the maximum sum and recursively reconstructs the operations for the left and right subarrays.

3. **Setting the Stairs (make_stairs):**
   - `make_stairs(i)` is a helper function that ensures the subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` forms a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - If the subarray is already a staircase, the function does nothing.
   - If the subarray is not a staircase, the function recursively sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to the result list.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
  - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the subarray, but the program uses a heuristic that sets the subarray to `length ** 2` and does not actually compute the MEX.
  - This heuristic is incorrect because the MEX of a subarray is not necessarily equal to the length of the subarray. For example, the MEX of `[1, 2, 3]` is 0, not 3.

- **Incorrect Use of `make_stairs`:**
  - The `make_stairs` function is intended to set the subarray to a staircase of MEX values, but it is not used correctly in the `func_2` function. The function `make_stairs` is called with `length - 1`, but it does not return the operations, and the `res` list is not updated correctly.
  - The function `make_stairs` also does not handle the case where the subarray is not a staircase correctly. It sets the entire subarray to the same value, which is not the correct MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX of subarrays and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
