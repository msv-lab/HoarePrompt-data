The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `min_indices`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `min_indices`. If `min_indices` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The state `max_index` is `n-1` and `min_index` is `min_indices[0]` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `min_indices` must contain at least one element, and `i` will take the value of the first element in `min_indices` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list that must contain at least one element, `min_index` is `min_indices[0]`, `i` is `min_indices[0]`**
