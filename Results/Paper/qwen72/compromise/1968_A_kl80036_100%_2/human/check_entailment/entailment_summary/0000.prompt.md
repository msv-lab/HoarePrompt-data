Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

# Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `x - 1` and prints this value. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `x` are no longer relevant, and the program has printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 1` for the corresponding test case.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
