You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case. The loop prints the value of x - 1 for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `x - 1` and prints this value. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `x` are no longer relevant, and the program has printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 1` for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The greatest common divisor \( \gcd(x, y) \) of two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is at most \( y \) when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) is either 1 (if \( x \) is prime or \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are coprime) or a small number (if \( x \) and \( x-1 \) share a common divisor).
   - In either case, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be maximized when \( y = x - 1 \) because \( y \) is the largest possible value less than \( x \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

4. **Verification:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \) and \( \gcd(10, 9) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 6 \) and \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \) and \( \gcd(21, 20) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \) and \( \gcd(100, 99) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) and \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 999 \) and \( \gcd(1000, 999) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(1000, 999) + 999 = 1 + 999 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 5 \) and \( \gcd(6, 5) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6 \).

   In all these cases, the program correctly outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it always outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which is the optimal solution for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
