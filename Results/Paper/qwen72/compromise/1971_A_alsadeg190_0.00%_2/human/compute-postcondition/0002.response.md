Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read a new pair of integers (x, y) from the input. If x is greater than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. After all iterations, the values of x and y will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the loop variable i will be equal to x-1.**
