The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function uses two integers `x` and `y` provided as input, and they satisfy 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the description.
