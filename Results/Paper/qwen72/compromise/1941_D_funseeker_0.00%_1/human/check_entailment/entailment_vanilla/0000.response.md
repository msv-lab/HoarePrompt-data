### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `list(map(int, func_1().split()))` to parse integers from a line. This is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for large inputs.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This represents a clockwise throw.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This represents a counterclockwise throw.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to `temp` for the next iteration.

4. **Handling Zero Position:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is because the player positions are 1-indexed, and `0` should be converted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the player numbers in increasing order.

### Potential Issues:
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative number, which is not correct for 1-indexed positions. To fix this, the program should use `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the result is always non-negative.
- **Set Initialization:**
  - The initial set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.
- **Direction Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the three possible directions ('0', '1', '?') and updates the set of possible positions accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n) % n)  # Corrected to handle negative modulo
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))  # Ensure the output is sorted

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = func_2()
    for _ in range(t):
        func_4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure non-negative results and sorts the output to meet the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
