Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the standard input (stdin), with any trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the first line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns this line with any trailing whitespace removed. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from stdin and the returned value is the stripped version of that line.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, and throws is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a string c_i ('0', '1', or '?').
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of the function `func_1()`. The specific value of the integer depends on the implementation of `func_1()` and the initial values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`. It returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The specific integer value depends on the implementation of `func_1()` and the initial values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the returned integer value, and the original parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws` remain unchanged.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned from `func_1()` and converting each part to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is obtained by splitting the string returned from `func_1()` and converting each part to an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed from the set and `n` is added to the set. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for `k` from `0` to `m`, with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` is present)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of ans] (where ans is a set containing all unique values of (x + k*r) % n and (x - k*r) % n for k from 0 to m, with 0 replaced by n if 0 is present)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters but uses the integers `n`, `m`, and `x` (where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`) provided by the function `func_3`. It computes a set `ans` containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the length of the set `ans` and the elements of the set `ans`.
