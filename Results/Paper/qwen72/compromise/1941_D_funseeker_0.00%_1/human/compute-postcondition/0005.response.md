The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` contains the value `0`, this value will be removed from the set. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration, but `0` is no longer in the set.**
