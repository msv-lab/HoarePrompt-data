Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. The new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are unknown, but they are integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are unknown. However, the precondition that `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers is still valid.
