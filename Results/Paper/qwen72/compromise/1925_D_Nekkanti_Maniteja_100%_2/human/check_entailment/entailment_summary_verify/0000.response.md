### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`: Pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Expected Calculation:**
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs plus the expected number of times each pair has been chosen before.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program `func` does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Calculates the modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - Initializes `s` (cumulative sum) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).
   - Reads the `m` pairs and their initial friendship values, adding them to `a`.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

#### Function Summary:
- `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children.
- `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
- The loop updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion `i`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1) // 2` is correctly calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum `a` of the initial friendship values is correctly computed by iterating over the `m` pairs.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k): s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to account for the expected increase in friendship values due to previous selections, but it is not correctly formulated.
   - The correct expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * (a + i * m)`, where `i` is the number of excursions already performed.

4. **Correct Formula:**
   - The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected number of times each pair has been chosen before, scaled by the probability of choosing a friend pair.
   - The correct update for `s` should be:
     ```python
     s = s + c * (a + i * m)
     ```

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the provided example:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`
- `a = 1` (initial friendship value of the only pair)
- `c = pow(3 * 2 // 2, -1, 10**9 + 7) = pow(3, -1, 10**9 + 7) = 333333336` (modular inverse of 3)

The correct expected value calculation for each excursion:
- For the first excursion: `s = 0 + c * (a + 0 * m) = 0 + 333333336 * 1 = 333333336`
- For the second excursion: `s = 333333336 + c * (a + 1 * m) = 333333336 + 333333336 * (1 + 1) = 333333336 + 666666672 = 1000000008`

Since `1000000008 % (10^9 + 7) = 40000020`, the correct output for this test case is `40000020`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **accurate**. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The loop that updates `s` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
