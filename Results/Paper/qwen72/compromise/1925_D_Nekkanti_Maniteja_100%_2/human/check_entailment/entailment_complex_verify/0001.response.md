### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). This is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The program defines \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is a common prime number used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer data types. This is correct and matches the problem constraints.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \). The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse is also correct.

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program initializes \( a \) to 0 and then reads the friendship values of the \( m \) pairs, summing them up in \( a \). This is correct because \( a \) represents the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values over \( k \) excursions. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends.

   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \), which simplifies to \( c \cdot m \). This is correct.
   - The expected value for the \( i \)-th excursion is \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). This is correct but can be simplified. The expected value for each excursion can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value for the } i\text{-th excursion} = c \cdot (a + i \cdot m)
     \]
   - Summing this over \( k \) excursions gives:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot \left( a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right)
     \]

6. **Summing Expected Values**: The program sums the expected values for all \( k \) excursions and takes the result modulo \( M \). The current implementation does this correctly but can be optimized to avoid the loop over \( k \) excursions.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case. This is correct and matches the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse is correct and ensures that the division is performed correctly under modulo \( M \).

- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation is correct but can be simplified. The simplified formula:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot \left( a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right)
  \]
  avoids the need for a loop over \( k \) excursions, making the program more efficient.

- **Efficiency**: The current implementation iterates over \( k \) excursions, which can be optimized. However, the current implementation will still produce the correct result for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:

The program is correct in its logic and calculations. While it can be optimized to avoid the loop over \( k \) excursions, the current implementation will still produce the correct result for the given problem constraints.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem constraints. However, it can be optimized for better performance.
