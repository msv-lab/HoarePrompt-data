The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers, sorts the array, and prints the count of the middle element in the sorted array. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without retaining the final values of any variables used within the loop.
