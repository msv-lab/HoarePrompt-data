Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the program simply counts the number of occurrences of the current median in the array and prints this count. This does not address the core requirement of determining the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the current median of the array.
2. Determine the smallest value greater than the current median.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the current median equal to this smallest value greater than the current median.

The current implementation does not perform these steps. Instead, it just counts the occurrences of the median, which is irrelevant to the problem's goal.

Correctness: **False**
