Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.
2. **Time Parsing**: For each test case, the function reads a string `s` in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`. This correctly parses the input into integer values for the hour and minute.
3. **Time Conversion**:
   - If `h == 0`, it sets `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'`. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h > 12`, it sets `h = h - 12` and `day = 'PM'`. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format should be converted to 1 to 11 in 12-hour format and marked as PM.
   - If `h == 12`, it sets `day = 'PM'`. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day = 'AM'`. This is correct because these hours are already in the 12-hour format and should be marked as AM.
4. **Output Formatting**: The function prints the time in the format `'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'`, which ensures that the hour and minute are always two digits and followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. This is correct and matches the required output format.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
