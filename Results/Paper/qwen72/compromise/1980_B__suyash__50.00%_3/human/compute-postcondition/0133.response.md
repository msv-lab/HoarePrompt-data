Output State: **`t` is greater than the length of the list `l`, `i` is the length of the list `l` + 1, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the new list `b`, `o` is a list of strings obtained from the new input and split, sorted in descending order, `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the sorted list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order. If `k` is equal to `n`, all the above conditions hold true.**
