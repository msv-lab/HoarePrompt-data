Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is 1, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, `k` is updated to the third integer in the new list `b` minus the count of the string at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `o` as recorded in the dictionary `dic` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` as recorded in the dictionary `dic`, `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the list `o` after it has been sorted in descending order, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 2 elements, `o` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, now sorted in descending order. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
