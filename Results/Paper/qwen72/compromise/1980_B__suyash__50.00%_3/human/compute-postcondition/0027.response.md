Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`, `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the list `o` before it was sorted, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 1 element, and `fav` is equal to `l[i]`**
