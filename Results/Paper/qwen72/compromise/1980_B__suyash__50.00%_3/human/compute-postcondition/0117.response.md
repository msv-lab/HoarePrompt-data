Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, `k` is reduced by the value of `dic[l[2]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
