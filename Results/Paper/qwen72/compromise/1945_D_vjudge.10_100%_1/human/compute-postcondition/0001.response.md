The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range definition. For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning it should have at least one value to iterate over.

The range is defined as `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, which means:
- The loop starts at `n - 1`.
- The loop ends at `-1` (exclusive), so it will stop at `0`.
- The loop decrements by `1` each time.

For this range to be valid and for the loop to execute at least once:
- `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than `0`.

The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop.

The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `x`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
