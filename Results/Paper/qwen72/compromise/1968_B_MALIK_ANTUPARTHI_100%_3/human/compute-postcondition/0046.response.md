Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0. If `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, `k` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`.***
