Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in the slice of `e` starting from index 0, plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
