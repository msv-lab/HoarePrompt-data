To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` is an input value.
   - `e` is an input value.
   - `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking.
   - `k` is the index of the last matched element in `e` or the index of the last element in `d` if the loop completes without breaking.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `k` is determined by the loop's behavior. It can either be the index of the last matched element in `e` or the index of the last element in `d` if the loop completes without breaking.

3. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop is not explicitly provided, but based on the description, it seems to involve iterating over `d` and `e` and breaking at some point.
   - If the loop breaks, `k` will be the index of the last matched element in `e`.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `k` will be the index of the last element in `d`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k` as determined by the loop's behavior.

Since the exact loop and the values of `d` and `e` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last matched element in `e` or the index of the last element in `d` if the loop completes without breaking)**
