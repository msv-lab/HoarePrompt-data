The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range defined by `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `j` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is 1.
- The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `b`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, and `b` must be greater than 2.**
