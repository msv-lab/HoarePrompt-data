The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range defined by `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1. Since the loop is defined by `range(b)`, `b` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer.**
