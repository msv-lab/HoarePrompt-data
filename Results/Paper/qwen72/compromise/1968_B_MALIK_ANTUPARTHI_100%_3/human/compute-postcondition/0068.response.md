Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(k)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `b` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `d` is an input value.
- `e` is an input value.
- `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `k` is the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1, or `j + 1` if the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`.

### Understanding the Variables:
- `t`, `n`, and `m` are not directly used in the `print(k)` statement, so we can ignore them for this specific task.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and their exact values are not provided.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `d` and `e` are input values, and their exact values are not provided.
- `j` is determined by the loop's breaking condition or the loop completing.
- `k` is determined based on the value of `j` and the conditions in the loop.

### Loop Logic:
The loop logic is not explicitly provided, but we can infer the following:
- The loop iterates over some range, and `j` is the index at which the loop breaks.
- If the loop completes without breaking, `j` is set to `b`.
- `k` is the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1.
- If the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1`.

### Determining `k`:
- If the loop completes without breaking, `j` is `b`, and `k` will be the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1.
- If the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`, `k` will be `j + 1`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe `k` based on the given conditions.

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last matching element in e plus 1, or j + 1 if the loop breaks due to k reaching c or j reaching b - 1)**
