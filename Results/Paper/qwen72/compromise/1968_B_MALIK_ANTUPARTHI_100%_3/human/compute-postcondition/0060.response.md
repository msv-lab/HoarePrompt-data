Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` updates the value of `k`.
- `k` is assigned the value of the index of `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]` (i.e., the part of `e` starting from index `k`), plus 1, plus the current value of `k`.
- The initial value of `k` is not specified, so we assume `k` is an integer.
- `d[j]` refers to the value at index 2 in `d`.
- `e[k:]` is a slice of `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of `d[j]` within this slice.
- The new value of `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`) remain unchanged.
