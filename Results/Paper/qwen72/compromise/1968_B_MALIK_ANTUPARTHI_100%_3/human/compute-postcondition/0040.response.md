To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is the loop index and is initialized to 0 by the `range(b)` function.
2. **Variable `b`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `i` is 1
- `d` is an input value
- `e` is an input value
- `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking
- `k` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `b` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will be set to 0 by the `range(b)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
