The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The value of `a` remains the same since it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last matched element in `e` or the index of the last element in `d` if the loop completes without breaking.**
