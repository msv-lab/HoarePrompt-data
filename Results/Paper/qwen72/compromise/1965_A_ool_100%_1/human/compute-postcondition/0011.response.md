Postcondition: ***`A` is True, `set_` remains a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`. If `not_c` is True, `A` is False, and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. Otherwise, `not_c` remains False if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, and `A` remains True.***
