To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `k - 1`. For the loop to execute, `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `k` must be greater than 1.

The state before the loop starts is as follows:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is the maximum subarray sum that does not drop below zero
- `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

Given this, the only variables that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are `i` and `k`.

For the loop to execute:
- `k` must be greater than 1
- `i` should start at 0 (as it is the initial value for the loop counter)

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum that does not drop below zero, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is 0**
