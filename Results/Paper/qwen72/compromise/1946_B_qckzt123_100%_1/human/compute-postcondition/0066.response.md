To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 1, because the loop runs from 0 to `k-2` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `t` will be the maximum value of the cumulative sums of the subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero.
- `tmp` will be the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero.
- `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is now equal to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums of the subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is 0**
