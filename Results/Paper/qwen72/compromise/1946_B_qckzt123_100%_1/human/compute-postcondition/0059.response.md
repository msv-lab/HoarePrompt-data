The only object in the loop head is the list `a`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element beyond what was processed in the previous iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least two elements, `tmp` is now `max(0, tmp) + a[1]`, and `t` is now `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `x` will be the third element in the list during the next iteration.

State: **`a` must have at least three elements, `tmp` is now `max(0, tmp) + a[1]`, and `t` is now `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`**
