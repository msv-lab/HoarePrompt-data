Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least three elements. If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, and `t` is updated to `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as `max(0, tmp) + a[1] + x`, and `t` is updated to `max(max(0, tmp) + a[1], max(t, max(0, tmp) + a[1]))`.***
