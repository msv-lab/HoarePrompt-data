The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since `ans` was already defined as `(ans + t) % MOD` in the initial state, the value of `ans` is effectively unchanged by this operation because it is already the remainder of a division by `MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`.**
