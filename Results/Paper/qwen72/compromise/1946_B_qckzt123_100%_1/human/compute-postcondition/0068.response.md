Output State: **`t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t % MOD`.
- All other variables (`tmp`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated using the updated value of `t`.
