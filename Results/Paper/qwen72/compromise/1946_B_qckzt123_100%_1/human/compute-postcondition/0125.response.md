The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case having its own `n` (the length of the array `a`), `k` (the number of operations), and `a` (the array itself). The function processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the length of an array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`. It returns the result of processing each test case.**
