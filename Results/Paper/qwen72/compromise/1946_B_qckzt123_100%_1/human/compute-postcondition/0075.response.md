Output State: **`t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` was previously `((s + t * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.
- The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be `((s + t * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD` because taking the modulus of `ans` with `MOD` removes the additional `t` that was added.
- All other variables (`t`, `tmp`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
