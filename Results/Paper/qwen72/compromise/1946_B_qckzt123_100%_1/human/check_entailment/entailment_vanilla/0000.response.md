### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum sum of the array can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum possible subarray sum.
   - The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum, we can add it to the total sum of the array in each operation.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `MOD = 1000000007` is used to ensure the result is within the required modulo.
     - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - **For each test case**:
     - Read `n` and `k` (length of the array and number of operations).
     - Read the array `a`.
     - Calculate the total sum `s` of the array.
     - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum `t`.
     - Initialize `ans` with the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum, modulo `MOD`.
     - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, double the maximum subarray sum `t` and add it to `ans`, ensuring the result is modulo `MOD`.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - It correctly updates the answer by adding the maximum subarray sum in each operation, ensuring the result is modulo `MOD`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as negative sums and zero arrays correctly.
   - It ensures that the sum is always positive by using `(s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
