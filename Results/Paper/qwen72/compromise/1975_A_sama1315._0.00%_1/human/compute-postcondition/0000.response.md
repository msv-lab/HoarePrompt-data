Output State: **The function is now set up to read from standard input, and it expects a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. No variables have been updated yet.**
