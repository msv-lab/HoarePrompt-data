The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It processes each test case by applying the function `func_1` to the array of integers and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.
