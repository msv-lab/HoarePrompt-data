### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a generator expression.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second element.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the problem's requirement of checking if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end.
   - The input handling and test case processing are correct.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.
   - To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should check if there exists a split point such that the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix.

### Example Analysis:
- **First Test Case**: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - The array cannot be sorted by any prefix-suffix swap.
  - The current implementation will return 'No', which is correct.

- **Second Test Case**: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - The array can be sorted by swapping the prefix `[7]` and the suffix `[9, 2, 2, 3]`.
  - The current implementation will return 'No', which is incorrect.

- **Third Test Case**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The array is already sorted.
  - The current implementation will return 'Yes', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle the prefix-suffix swap operation as required by the problem. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
