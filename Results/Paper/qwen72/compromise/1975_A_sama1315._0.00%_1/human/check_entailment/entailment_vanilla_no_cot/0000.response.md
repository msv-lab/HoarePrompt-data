Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is not correct because `func_1` does not properly handle the problem of determining if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

### Issues:
1. **`func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' immediately, which is incorrect because the array might still be sortable by performing the allowed operations.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix, you need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be split into two parts, and when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is sorted.
   - Specifically, you need to find a point `i` such that the subarray `arr[:i]` is in non-decreasing order, the subarray `arr[i:]` is in non-decreasing order, and the last element of `arr[:i]` is less than or equal to the first element of `arr[i:]`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is a corrected version of `func_1` that should work correctly:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the first index where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    i = 0
    while i < n - 1 and arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    
    # If the array is already sorted, return 'Yes'
    if i == n - 1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the last index where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    j = n - 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] >= arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    
    # Check if the subarrays are sorted and if the last element of the first subarray
    # is less than or equal to the first element of the second subarray
    if (i == -1 or arr[i] <= arr[j]) and (j == n or arr[j - 1] <= arr[i + 1]):
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

### Example Usage:
```python
#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

This corrected function should correctly determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
