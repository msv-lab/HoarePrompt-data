Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can become sorted after performing the specified operation (swapping a prefix and a suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` on `arr` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints all results, each on a new line.

3. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The program should determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix any number of times.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient to meet the problem requirements.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1`, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix any number of times.

Correctness: **False**
