Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to count the number of trailing zeros in each number and then use this information to determine the winner. However, this approach does not align with the game rules, which involve reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

Here's a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it only considers the number of trailing zeros, which does not affect the outcome of the game in this case.

**Explanation of the Case:**
- Anna can reverse the integer 2, which remains 2.
- Sasha can then concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\).
- Therefore, Sasha wins, but the program incorrectly outputs "Anna".

The program needs to simulate the actual game moves, including reversing digits and concatenating numbers, to determine the winner correctly. The current approach of counting trailing zeros and subtracting them in pairs does not capture the game's dynamics and can lead to incorrect results.
