The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads input from the user, splits it by spaces, and maps each split part to an integer. This function `r` is now available for use to read inputs in the specified format.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A lambda function `r` is defined to read space-separated integers from input.**
