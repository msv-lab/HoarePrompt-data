Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is `c`, `y` is `d`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `v` is `d - c`, `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`, and `u` is the value returned by `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is the new value of `c`, `y` is the new value of `d`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`), and `u` is `True`. If `c` is less than `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`, `x` is the new value of `c`, `y` is the new value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`). If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `-1`, `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`, `x` is the new value of `c`, `y` is the new value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`). If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
