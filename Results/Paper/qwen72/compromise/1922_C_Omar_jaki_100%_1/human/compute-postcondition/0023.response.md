Postcondition: **`a` remains a list with at least 6 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + 2000000000.0` and `b[-1] + 2000000000.0` for each iteration of the loop, `u` is now one less than its original value, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`, and `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
