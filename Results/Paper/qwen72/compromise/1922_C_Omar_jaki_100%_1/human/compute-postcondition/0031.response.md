Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list with at least 6 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + 2000000000.0` and `b[-1] + 2000000000.0` for each iteration of the loop, `u` is now two less than its original value but still non-zero, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `c >= d` holds true.***
