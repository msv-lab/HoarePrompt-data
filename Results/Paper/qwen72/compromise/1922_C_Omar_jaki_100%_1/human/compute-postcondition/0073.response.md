To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with 4 elements.
- `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
- `z` is `2000000000.0`.
- `u` is `-1`.
- `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`.
- `x` is the new value of `c`.
- `y` is the new value of `d`.
- `v` is `d - c` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
- `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
- If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`.
- If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`. Let's assume `r()` returns `(c_new, d_new)`.
   - Therefore, `c = c_new` and `d = d_new`.

2. **New Values of `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` is the new value of `c`, so `x = c_new`.
   - `y` is the new value of `d`, so `y = d_new`.

3. **Value of `v`:**
   - `v` is `d - c`, so `v = d_new - c_new`.

4. **Extending List `b`:**
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`.
   - This means the last element of `b` before extension is `b[-1]`, and the second-to-last element is `b[-2]`.
   - The new elements added are `b[-2] + v` and `b[-2] + v`.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - If `c` is less than `d`, `c` remains less than `d`.
   - If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])`.
   - We need to determine the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- Let's assume `c_new` and `d_new` are such that `c_new < d_new` (since the condition ensures this).
- The indices are:
  - `(d - 1) * 2 = (d_new - 1) * 2`
  - `(c - 1) * 2 = (c_new - 1) * 2`

- Since `b` is extended by two new elements, the length of `b` increases by 2.
- The new elements are `b[-2] + v` and `b[-2] + v`.

- The value at index `(d - 1) * 2` is `b[(d_new - 1) * 2]`.
- The value at index `(c - 1) * 2` is `b[(c_new - 1) * 2]`.

- Since `c_new < d_new`, `(d_new - 1) * 2` will be a larger index than `(c_new - 1) * 2`.

- The difference `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` will be the difference between these two values.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the operations, the print statement will output the difference between the values at the specified indices in the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list extended by two new elements, and the indices are calculated based on the new values of c and d)**
