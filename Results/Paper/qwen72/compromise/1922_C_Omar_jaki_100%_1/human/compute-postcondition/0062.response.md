Postcondition: ***The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is the new value of `c`, `y` is the new value of `d`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`), and `u` is `True`. If `c` is less than `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.***
