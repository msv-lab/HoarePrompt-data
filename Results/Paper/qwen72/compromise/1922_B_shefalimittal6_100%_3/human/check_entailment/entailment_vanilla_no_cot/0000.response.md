Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one of a different length. However, it does not consider the case where three sticks of different lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle, which is a crucial part of the problem.

For example, in the second test case of the provided example input, the program should identify that the sticks with lengths \(2^3\), \(2^2\), and \(2^3\) (or equivalently, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th sticks) can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the program's logic only counts combinations where at least two sticks have the same length, and it does not check if three different sticks can form a triangle.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
2. Count the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one of a different length.
3. Count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of different lengths that can form a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick).

The current implementation only covers the first two points, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.
