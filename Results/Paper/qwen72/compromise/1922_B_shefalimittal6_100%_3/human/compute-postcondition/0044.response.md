Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is `2 * v[1] + v[2]`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 0 if `v[1]` is less than 3. If `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
