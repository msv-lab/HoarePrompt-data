Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of the string at `data[idx]` to `x`.
- `idx` is `n + 3`, so `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
