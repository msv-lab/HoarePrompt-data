The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state variable `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`, and `results` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list**
