Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 6`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 2, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 6]`, `_` is 2, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of elements in `v` that can form pairs and triplets.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` converts the string at `data[idx]` to an integer and assigns it to `x`.
- `idx` is `n + n + 6`, so `x` is now the integer value of `data[n + n + 6]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
