Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `n`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
