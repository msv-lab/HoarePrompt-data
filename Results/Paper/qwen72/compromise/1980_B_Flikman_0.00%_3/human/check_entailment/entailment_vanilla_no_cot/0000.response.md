Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be removed or left. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the correct position of the favorite cube after sorting. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the favorite cube will be removed if there are at least `k` cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube's value. However, this is not always true, as the favorite cube could still be among the first `k` cubes even if there are fewer than `k` cubes with a greater value, due to the equal value cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        # Sort the list in non-increasing order
        a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Find the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list
        favorite_position = a_sorted.index(favorite_value)
        
        # Determine the outcome based on the position
        if favorite_position < k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_position >= k and a_sorted[k-1] == favorite_value:
            print('MAYBE')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the List**: The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
2. **Finding the Position**: The position of the favorite cube in the sorted list is determined.
3. **Determining the Outcome**:
   - If the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, it will be removed, so the answer is "YES".
   - If the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes but the `k`-th cube has the same value as the favorite cube, it may or may not be removed, so the answer is "MAYBE".
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube will not be removed, so the answer is "NO".

This corrected version should handle all the cases correctly as per the problem description.
