Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least two elements, `value` is the second element of `a`, `same_value_count` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `same_value_count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `a` and `value` remain unchanged. The condition that `a` must have at least two elements and `value` being the second element of `a` still holds true.
