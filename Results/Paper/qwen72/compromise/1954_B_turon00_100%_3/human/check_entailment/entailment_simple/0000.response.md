Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the array) and the array `a` itself. This part is correct.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` using the variable `cnt`.
   - When it encounters an element that is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.

3. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

However, the logic has a critical flaw:
- The program only checks consecutive elements that are equal to `a[0]`. This does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not necessarily equal to `a[0]`.
- The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful. The array is beautiful if you can make all elements the same by using the specified operation. The program does not correctly handle this requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the dominant element in the array (the element that appears most frequently).
- Count the number of times this dominant element appears.
- Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that the dominant element cannot be made to fill the entire array using the specified operation.

The current program does not implement this logic and will fail on many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
