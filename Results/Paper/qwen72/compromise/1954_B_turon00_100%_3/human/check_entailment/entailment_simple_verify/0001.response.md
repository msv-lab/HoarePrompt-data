### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - It also initializes `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

3. **Loop through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` using a for loop.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it is equal to `tmp`.
     - If it is, it increments `cnt`.
     - If it is not, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - It then checks if `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n`.
     - If either condition is true, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
- A beautiful array can be made not beautiful by breaking the pattern of consecutive elements that can be replaced.
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive elements and finds the minimum length of these segments.
- However, the logic for determining if the array can be made not beautiful is flawed. The program only checks the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made not beautiful.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. According to the program:
- `tmp` is set to `1`.
- The segments of consecutive `1`s are `[1, 1, 1]` and `[1]`.
- The segments of consecutive `2`s are `[2, 2, 2]`.
- The program will output `3` (the length of the longest segment of `1`s or `2`s).

However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing any `2` will break the pattern and make the array not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It only considers the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements, which is not sufficient. The program fails to account for the possibility of breaking the pattern by removing elements that are not part of the longest segment.
