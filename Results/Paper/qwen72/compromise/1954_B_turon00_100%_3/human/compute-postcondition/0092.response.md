The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function is expected to handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function is likely to return some form of processed output for each test case, such as a list of results or a single aggregated result.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. The function is designed to handle up to `10^4` test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not specified.**
