Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.
- Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(-1)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer `-1`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
- The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
