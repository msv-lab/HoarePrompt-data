Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.** 

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
