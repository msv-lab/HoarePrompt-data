Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0.** 

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
