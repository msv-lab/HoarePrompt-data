Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.**
