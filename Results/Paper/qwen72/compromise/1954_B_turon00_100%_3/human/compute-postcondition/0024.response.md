Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `_` is still a temporary variable used in the loop, but it is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to the first element of the list `a` (`a[0]`).
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop has completed all iterations, meaning it has processed every element in the list `a`.
- The variable `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
- The variable `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop's execution. If no such consecutive elements were found, `ans` will be the minimum value encountered, which is typically 0.
