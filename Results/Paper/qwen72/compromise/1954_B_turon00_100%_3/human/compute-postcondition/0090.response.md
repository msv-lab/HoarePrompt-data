Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.***
