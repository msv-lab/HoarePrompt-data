Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0` if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 2.
- The value of `ans` remains the same, which is the minimum of `n` and `0` if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
