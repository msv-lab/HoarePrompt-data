To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's carefully analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2.
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
- `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0.**
