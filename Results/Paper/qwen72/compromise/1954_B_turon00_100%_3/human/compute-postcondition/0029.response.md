To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a` (since `i = n-1`).
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of such consecutive elements found during the iteration.

3. **Logic of the Code:**
   - The code snippet provided is `print(ans)`.
   - `ans` is the result of an iteration process where the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` is determined.
   - Since `ans` is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`, `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Given that `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the value of `ans` will be a positive integer less than `n`.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element `tmp`, which is a positive integer less than `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element `tmp` and is a positive integer less than `n`)**
