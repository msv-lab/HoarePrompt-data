Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 0 and `ans` was initially equal to `n`, the minimum value between `n` (which is greater than 1) and `cnt` (which is 0) is 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
