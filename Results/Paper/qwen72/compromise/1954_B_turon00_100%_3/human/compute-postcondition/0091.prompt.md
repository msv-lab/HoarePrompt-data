Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the postcondition remains as described. If `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the postcondition also remains as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, if `n` is not 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, no further changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
