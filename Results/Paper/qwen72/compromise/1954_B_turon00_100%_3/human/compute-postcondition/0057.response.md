Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The value `-1` is a constant and will be printed regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, or `ans`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement will always print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
