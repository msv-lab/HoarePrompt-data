Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost by sorting the ticket prices and then selecting the first `q` days to purchase tickets. However, the logic for calculating the total cost is flawed.
   - The formula `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrect. It does not account for the increasing ticket prices correctly after each purchase.
   - The logic for handling the case where `n * m != k` is also incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and does not properly account for the price increases.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Price Increases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the price increases after purchasing tickets. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, but the program does not update the prices accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Use of `math.ceil`:**
   - The use of `math.ceil(k / m)` to determine the number of days `q` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The number of days needed to purchase `k` tickets should be determined by the minimum number of days required to buy all tickets, considering the maximum tickets that can be bought per day.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Sort the ticket prices in ascending order.
- Use a greedy approach to buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
- Keep track of the total cost and the number of tickets bought each day.
- Update the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets bought
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        # Initialize the day counter
        day = 0
        
        # While we still need to buy tickets
        while tickets_bought < k:
            # Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            
            # Calculate the cost for this day
            cost = tickets_to_buy * (prices[day] + tickets_bought)
            
            # Add the cost to the total cost
            total_cost += cost
            
            # Update the number of tickets bought
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Move to the next day
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting the Prices:** The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
- **Greedy Approach:** We buy the maximum number of tickets allowed per day (`m`) or the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`), whichever is smaller.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost for each day is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets bought by the price on that day, adjusted for the number of tickets already bought.
- **Total Cost:** The total cost is accumulated over the days until all `k` tickets are bought.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always buying tickets on the cheapest available days and correctly accounting for the price increases.
