### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line of input.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for the `n` days from the second line of input.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - It sorts the list `M` to consider the days with the lowest prices first, which is a good strategy to minimize the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - It calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given that you can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - It selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days (i.e., `n * m`) is exactly `k`, it calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` cheapest days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day, which is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, it means that on the last day, you need to buy fewer than `m` tickets.
     - It pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day among the selected days) and stores it in `w`.
     - It calculates `mu` as the number of tickets needed on the last day, which is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - It calculates the cost for the last day as `mu * w`.
     - It recalculates the cost for the remaining days as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `q-1` cheapest days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day among the remaining `q-1` days.
     - `n * m * mu` is the additional cost due to the price increase on the last day.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and sorts the ticket prices to minimize the cost.
- The logic for calculating the number of days needed and the cost is generally correct.
- However, there is a potential issue in the cost calculation for the case where `n * m` is not equal to `k`. Specifically, the additional cost due to the price increase on the last day is not correctly calculated.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** entirely correct due to the potential issue in the cost calculation for the case where `n * m` is not equal to `k`.

### Correctness: **False**
