### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The tower starts with 0 cubes.
   - After \( n \) moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between \( 0 \) and \( n \), inclusive, depending on the sequence of adding and removing cubes.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( n \) is even, the number of cubes in the tower can be any even number between 0 and \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the number of cubes in the tower can be any odd number between 0 and \( n \).

4. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If \( n \) is equal to \( m \), it is always possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes in \( m \) moves.
   - If \( m \) is greater than \( n \), it is impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If \( m \) is equal to \( n - 1 \), it is possible if \( n \) is odd (since \( n - 1 \) will be even, and adding \( n - 1 \) cubes and removing one cube will result in \( m \) cubes).
   - If \( m \) is even and \( n \) is even, it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes and removing \( n - m \) cubes.
   - If \( m \) is odd and \( n \) is odd, it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes and removing \( n - m \) cubes.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

5. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If \( n \) is equal to \( m \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is greater than \( n \), it prints "No".
     - If \( m \) is equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is even and \( n \) is even, it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is odd and \( n \) is odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

6. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The conditions in the program correctly cover all the possible scenarios for \( n \) and \( m \) as described in the problem.
   - The logic ensures that the program will print "Yes" or "No" based on the parity and the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \).

7. **Challenges to the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the conditions and their implications.
   - The program's logic aligns with the conditions described in the assessment.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or missing cases in the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
