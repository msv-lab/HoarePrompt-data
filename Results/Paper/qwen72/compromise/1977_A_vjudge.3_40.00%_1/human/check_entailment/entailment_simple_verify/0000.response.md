Reasoning:

The original assessment points out a specific case where the program fails to produce the correct output. Let's analyze this in detail:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \( n = m \), the program correctly outputs "Yes" because Nikita can simply add \( n \) cubes in \( n \) moves.
   - If \( m > n \), the program correctly outputs "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If \( m = n - 1 \), the program correctly outputs "Yes" because Nikita can add \( n \) cubes and then remove 1 cube.
   - If \( m \) and \( n \) are both even or both odd, the program outputs "Yes". This is based on the idea that the parity (evenness or oddness) of \( n \) and \( m \) must match for it to be possible to end up with \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs "No".

2. **Parity Check**:
   - The program checks if \( m \) and \( n \) have the same parity (both even or both odd) and outputs "Yes" if they do. This is correct because:
     - If \( n \) is even and \( m \) is even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to achieve \( m \) cubes.
     - If \( n \) is odd and \( m \) is odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs, and the final move can be an addition or removal to achieve \( m \) cubes.

3. **Specific Case**:
   - The original assessment mentions the case \( n = 6 \) and \( m = 4 \). According to the program:
     - \( n \) is even and \( m \) is even.
     - The program will output "Yes" because both \( n \) and \( m \) are even.
   - This is the correct output because Nikita can add 4 cubes and then remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower of 4 cubes.

4. **General Case**:
   - For \( n \geq m \) and \( n - m \) is even, the program will correctly output "Yes" because the parity check will pass.
   - For \( n \geq m \) and \( n - m \) is odd, the program will correctly output "No" because the parity check will fail.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \) correctly by outputting "Yes".
   - It also handles cases where \( n \) and \( m \) are large (up to 100) correctly by checking the parity and the conditions specified.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the original assessment. The specific case \( n = 6 \) and \( m = 4 \) is handled correctly, and the program's logic is sound.

Final: **True**
