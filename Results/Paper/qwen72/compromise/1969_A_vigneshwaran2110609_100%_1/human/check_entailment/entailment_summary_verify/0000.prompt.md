You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers. The function then checks for each element in `l` if the element at the index specified by the current element minus one equals the current index plus one. If this condition is met for any element, the function prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is never met, the function prints `3`. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value. The variable `t` is not used within the function, and the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it always prints either 2 or 3, which is not always the correct minimum number of invitations required. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

The program works correctly for the given example, but it fails for other cases. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

However, the program does not correctly handle the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 3 1 5 6 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program prints 3, but the correct answer should be 4. The logic in the program only checks if a friend and their best friend are directly linked and prints 2 if they are, otherwise it prints 3. This does not account for more complex scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required might be greater than 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
