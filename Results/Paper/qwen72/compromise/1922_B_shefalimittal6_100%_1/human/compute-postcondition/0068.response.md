Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value.
- Since `cnt` is 0, the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` evaluates to 0.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after the execution of the code.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
