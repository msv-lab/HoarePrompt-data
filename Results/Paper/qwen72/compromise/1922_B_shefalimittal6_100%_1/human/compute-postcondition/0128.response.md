Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of the combinations of counts of elements in `v` from index 0 to `n` where the count is at least 2 (combinations of 2) and at least 3 (combinations of 3), `n` must be at least 0, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list that now includes the string representation of `ans`.** 

The code `results.append(str(ans))` adds the string representation of the variable `ans` to the list `results`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
