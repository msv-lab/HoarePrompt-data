The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
