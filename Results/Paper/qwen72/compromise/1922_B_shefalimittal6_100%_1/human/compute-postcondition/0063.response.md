Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` which is equal to `n`, `i` remains `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`.
- After each iteration, `x` is set to the integer value of the next element in `data` starting from `data[idx]`, and `idx` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is the index.
- After `n` iterations, `idx` will have been incremented by `n` because the loop runs `n` times and `idx` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The value of `v[x]` will be incremented by `n` for the last `x` value that was processed, because the loop runs `n` times and each time `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, and since `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` and each element is incremented by 1 exactly once during the loop, `cnt` will be equal to `n`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at `n` because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` is not affected by the loop, so it remains greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 outside the loop.
- The variable `results` is not affected by the loop, so it remains a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `ans`.
