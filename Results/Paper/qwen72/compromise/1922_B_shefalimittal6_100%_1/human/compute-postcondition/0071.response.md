Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is the value of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Additionally, the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- Since `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` will be a non-negative integer.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` added to its previous value (which was 0).
