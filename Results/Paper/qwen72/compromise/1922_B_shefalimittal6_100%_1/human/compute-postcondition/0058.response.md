Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `idx` is incremented by 1. The code snippet `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1, where `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
