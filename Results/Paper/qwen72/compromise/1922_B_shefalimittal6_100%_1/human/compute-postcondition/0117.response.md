Postcondition: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, and if `v[i]` is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
