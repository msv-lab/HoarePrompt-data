The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 1, and `v[x]` is increased by 1.

Since the loop head does not involve `x`, `idx`, or `v`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
