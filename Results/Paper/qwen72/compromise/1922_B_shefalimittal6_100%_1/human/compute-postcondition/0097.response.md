Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` is now `idx + 1`.
- The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the new value assigned from `data[idx]`.
- The other variables (`n` and `_`) remain unchanged.
