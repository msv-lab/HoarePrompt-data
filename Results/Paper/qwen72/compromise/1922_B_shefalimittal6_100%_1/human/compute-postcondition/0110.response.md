Postcondition: ***`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, and if `v[i]` is at least 2, the current value of `v[i]` remains at least 2.***
