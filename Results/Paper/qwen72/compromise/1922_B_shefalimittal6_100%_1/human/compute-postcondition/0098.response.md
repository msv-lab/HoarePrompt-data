Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially `idx + 1`, it is now `idx + 2`.
- The other variables (`n`, `_`, `x`, and `v[x]`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
- `x` still holds the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, which was the value of `data[idx]` before `idx` was incremented.
- `v[x]` is still incremented by 1, as this operation has already been performed.
