You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

                arr.append(i)

        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop has executed the specified number of times, and for each iteration, the following conditions hold: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`. If `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. Any remaining elements in `ans` are 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the result. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The function then generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, with any remaining positions filled with 0. If the sum of the generated powers of 2 is less than `k`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the total sum equals `k`. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the number of bits in `k` correctly. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 3`, the program will output `[1, 2, 0, 0]`, which sums to 3 but does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of the sequence. The correct output should be `[1, 1, 1, 0]`, which also sums to 3 but has three 1s in the binary representation of the OR (i.e., `1 | 1 | 1 | 0 = 1` in binary). 

The issue lies in how the program constructs the sequence. It only appends powers of 2 based on the bits set in `k`, which may not always result in the maximum number of 1s in the OR of the sequence when `n` is larger than the number of bits in `k`.
