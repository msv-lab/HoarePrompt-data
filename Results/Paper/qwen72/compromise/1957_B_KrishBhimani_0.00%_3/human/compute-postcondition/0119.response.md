To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in arr:
```

The only object in the loop head is `arr`, and the variable `i` will be assigned values from `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not run at all.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is not initialized before the loop. It will be assigned the first value from `arr` when the loop starts.
3. **State of `arr`**: `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
