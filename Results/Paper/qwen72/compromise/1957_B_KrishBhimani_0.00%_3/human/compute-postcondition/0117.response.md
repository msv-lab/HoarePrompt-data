Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `k` is 0, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns `ans` to an empty list, but it does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the value of `ans`.
