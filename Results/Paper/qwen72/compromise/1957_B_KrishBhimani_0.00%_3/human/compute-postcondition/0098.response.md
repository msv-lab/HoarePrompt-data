Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr` (which is None), `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- `k0` is assigned the value of `k`, which is the second integer from `l1`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `ans`, and `l1` remain unchanged from their initial state.
