Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `arr` contains `[2]` if `k0` was an even number before the shift, or `[0, 2]` if `k0` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.***
