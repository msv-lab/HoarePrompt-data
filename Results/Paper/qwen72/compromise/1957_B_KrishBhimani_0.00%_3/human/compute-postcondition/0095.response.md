Output State: **`i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`, and if `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`. `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is preserved for all variables except `l1`.
- The code `l1 = input().split()` reads input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to `l1`.
- The values of `i`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.
