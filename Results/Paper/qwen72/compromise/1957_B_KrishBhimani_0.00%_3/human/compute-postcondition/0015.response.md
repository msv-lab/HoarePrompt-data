Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to be `k` right-shifted by 1 bit.
- The original `k` was the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 1 bit, so after the code execution, `k` is now the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits.
- All other variables (`n`, `k0`, `l1`, `int(input())`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
