Postcondition: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input. The current value of `c` is `n - 1`.**
