Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
