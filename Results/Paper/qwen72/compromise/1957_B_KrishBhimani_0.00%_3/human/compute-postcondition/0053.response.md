The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero (i.e., `k` is truthy), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the second integer from `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, `i` is 0**
