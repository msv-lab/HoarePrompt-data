Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `k` is 0, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `1 << i`, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input. If `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `k0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `1 << i` and `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 3, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `1 << i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
