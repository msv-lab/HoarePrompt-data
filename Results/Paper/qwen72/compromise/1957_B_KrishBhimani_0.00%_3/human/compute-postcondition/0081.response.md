Output State: **`i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1 << i, k0 - sum(ans)]`, `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
