Postcondition: ***`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to contain two elements: the first element is `1 << i` and the second element is `k0 - (1 << i)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
