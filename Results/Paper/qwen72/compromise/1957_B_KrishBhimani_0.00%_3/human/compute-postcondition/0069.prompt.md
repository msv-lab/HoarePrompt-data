Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` if `k` was an odd number before the shift. `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` shifted right by 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append. `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`. `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `i` is 1. If `k` was an odd number before the shift, `arr` contains `[0]` and `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` if `k` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` shifted right by 1 bit, and then shifted right by another 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 3, `arr` contains `[2]` if `k0` was an even number before the shift, or `[0, 2]` if `k0` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is `k // 2`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
