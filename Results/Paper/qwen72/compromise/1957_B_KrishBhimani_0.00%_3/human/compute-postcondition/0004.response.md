Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list.**

The value of `k` is assigned to `k0`, so `k0` now holds the same value as `k`, which is the second integer from `l1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
