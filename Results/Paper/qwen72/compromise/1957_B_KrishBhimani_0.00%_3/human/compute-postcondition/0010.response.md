Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k` right-shifted by 1 bit, which means `k` is divided by 2 and the result is truncated to an integer.
- `k0` remains the second integer from `l1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `int(input())`, `i`, and `arr`) are not affected by the code snippet. The condition for `arr` remains the same based on the original value of `k`.
