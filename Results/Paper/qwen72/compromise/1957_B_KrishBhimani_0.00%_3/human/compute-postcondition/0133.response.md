Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - (1 << i) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation:
- `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` adds a new element to the list `ans`.
- The initial `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `1 << i`.
- The sum of the elements in `ans` is `(1 << i) + (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2 * (1 << i)`.
- The new element added to `ans` is `k0 - 2 * (1 << i)`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - 2 * (1 << i)`.
