Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the number of bits in the original `k`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `l1`, `int(input())`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `ans` being an empty list.
