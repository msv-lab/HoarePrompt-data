The function `func` accepts a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of four tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether the given coordinates form a valid square with the specified properties.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) that form a square. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether the corresponding test case forms a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
