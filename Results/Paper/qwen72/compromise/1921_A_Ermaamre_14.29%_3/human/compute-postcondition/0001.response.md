The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state, the function should take a list of test cases, and `a` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
