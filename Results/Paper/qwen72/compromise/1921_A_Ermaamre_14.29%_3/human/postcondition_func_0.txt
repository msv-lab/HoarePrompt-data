The function reads an integer `a` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function then calculates and prints the area of each square, which is the square of the side length. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `a` remains unchanged, and the loop has iterated `a` times, with the final values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` based on the last iteration.
