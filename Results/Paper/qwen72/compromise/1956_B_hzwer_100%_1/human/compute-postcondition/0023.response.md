The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**
