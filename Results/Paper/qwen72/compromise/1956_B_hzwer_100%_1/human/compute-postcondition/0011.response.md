Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains the same in terms of its elements and length, as it is only being iterated over and not modified.
- The list `cnt` is updated such that `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`. After the loop completes, `cnt[i]` will contain the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
