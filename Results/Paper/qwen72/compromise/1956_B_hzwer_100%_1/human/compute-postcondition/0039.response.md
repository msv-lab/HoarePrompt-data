Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: After the loop completes, `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in the list `cnt`. This means that for each count `x` in `cnt`, if `x` is greater than 1, `x - 1` is added to `ans`; otherwise, 0 is added to `ans`. This effectively counts how many times each integer in `a` appears more than once.
