Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, the following holds: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. Each `ans` value is printed for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` are updated and used within the loop.
- After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, the final state of `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be as described above.
- The value of `ans` for each test case is printed, and this process repeats for all `t` test cases.
