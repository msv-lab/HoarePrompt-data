To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in cnt:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `cnt`.
- For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be a non-empty list.
- The length of `cnt` is `n + 1`, which means `cnt` will always have at least one element as long as `n` is greater than 0 (which is given).

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head is `x` and the list `cnt`.
- Since `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` will always have at least one element.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes.

### Final State:
Since the loop will always execute given the conditions, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is 0**
