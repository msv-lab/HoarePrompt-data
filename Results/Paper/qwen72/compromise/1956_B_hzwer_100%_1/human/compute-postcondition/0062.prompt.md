Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `input` now reads a single line from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
