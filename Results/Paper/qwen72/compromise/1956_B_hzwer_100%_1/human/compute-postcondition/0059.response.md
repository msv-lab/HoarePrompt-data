Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value.
- `x` is the next element in the list `cnt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, where `x` is the next element in `cnt`.
