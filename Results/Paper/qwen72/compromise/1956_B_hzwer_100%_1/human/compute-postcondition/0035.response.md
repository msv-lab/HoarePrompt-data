The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cnt`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `cnt`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the first element of `cnt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the next element in `cnt`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the second element of `cnt`**
