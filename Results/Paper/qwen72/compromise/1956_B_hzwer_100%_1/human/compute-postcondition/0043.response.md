Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, and the loop has not yet completed the number of iterations specified by the input.**

Explanation:
- The line `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to `a`.
- The initial state mentions that `a` was already a list of integers read from the input, but this line overwrites the previous value of `a` with a new list of integers.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The loop status (not yet completed) remains the same.
