Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by taking your turns optimally, considering that Nene will also play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers on your cards.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer on your cards. This is done using a loop that increments the count for each integer found in your hand.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**: The solution then iterates over the `cnt` list to calculate the maximum number of points you can score. For each integer `x`, if it appears more than once (`cnt[x] > 1`), you can score a point for the second occurrence. The expression `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that you only add points for the second occurrence of each integer.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of points you can score for each test case.

This approach correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that you maximize your score while considering Nene's optimal play. Therefore, the solution is correct.
