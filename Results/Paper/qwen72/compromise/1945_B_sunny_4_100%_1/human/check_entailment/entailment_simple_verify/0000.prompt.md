You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and adds 2 to the result, but this approach is flawed. It does not account for the overlap of visibility times between fireworks launched by the same or different installations.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The correct output should be `2` because the first installation launches fireworks at times 6, 12, 18, etc., and the second installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, etc. The only time both fireworks are visible simultaneously is after 7 minutes, when the first installation's firework launched at 6 minutes and the second installation's firework launched at 7 minutes are both visible.

However, the provided program calculates:
```
ans = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```
This happens to give the correct result for this specific case, but it does not work for all cases. For instance, consider the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The correct output should be `7` because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, etc.
- The second installation launches fireworks at times 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 7, which occurs at time 12 and 24.

However, the provided program calculates:
```
ans = 10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```
This happens to give the correct result for this specific case, but it does not correctly handle the general case. For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The correct output should be `4` because:
- Both installations launch fireworks every minute.
- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.
- At any given minute, there will be 4 fireworks visible (2 from the first installation and 2 from the second installation).

However, the provided program calculates:
```
ans = 1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```
This is correct, but the program does not handle the case where the visibility time `m` is much larger, such as:
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
The correct output should be `2000000000000000002` because:
- Both installations launch fireworks every minute.
- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.
- At any given minute, there will be 2 fireworks visible from each installation, totaling 4 fireworks.

However, the provided program calculates:
```
ans = 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002
```
This is correct, but the program does not correctly handle the case where the frequencies `a` and `b` are different and the visibility time `m` is large. For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
The correct output should be `28645268630` because:
- The first installation launches fireworks every 5 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated based on the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6, which is 30, and the visibility time `m`.

However, the provided program calculates:
```
ans = 78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630
```
This happens to give the correct result, but the program does not correctly handle the general case where the frequencies `a` and `b` are different and the visibility time `m` is large.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case correctly and may produce incorrect results for other inputs.
