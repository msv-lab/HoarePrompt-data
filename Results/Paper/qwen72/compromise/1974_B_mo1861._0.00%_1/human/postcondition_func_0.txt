The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. In `s`, each character from `b` is replaced with a corresponding character from the end of the alphabet, maintaining the original order of characters in `b`. The mapping is based on the sorted unique characters in `b`, with the smallest character in `b` being mapped to the last letter of the alphabet ('z'), the second smallest to the second last ('y'), and so on. The length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.
