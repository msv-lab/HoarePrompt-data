The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified bounds. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The function is designed to compute and return values related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` along with the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
