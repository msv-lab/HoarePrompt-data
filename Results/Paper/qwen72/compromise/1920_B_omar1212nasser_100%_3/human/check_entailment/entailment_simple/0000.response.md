Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first, which helps in maximizing the sum.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.
   - The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The sum `s2` of the last `x` elements (which Bob can flip) is calculated.
   - The list `pos` is initialized to store the possible sums after different numbers of removals by Alice.
   - The first element in `pos` is the sum `s` minus twice the sum of the last `x` elements. This is because Bob will flip the `x` largest elements to minimize the sum.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `k` (the number of removals Alice can make):
     - For each iteration, the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the `i`-th smallest element.
     - The sum `s2` is updated to reflect the changes in the elements that Bob can flip.
     - If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the array, the `i`-th smallest element is added to `s2`.
     - The new possible sum is appended to `pos`.
   - Finally, the maximum value in `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal sum for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic of the function `func_2`:
- The loop in `func_2` is incorrectly removing elements from the end of the sorted list `elements` instead of the beginning. This means Alice is removing the largest elements, which is not optimal for maximizing the sum. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.

To correct this, the loop should remove elements from the beginning of the sorted list `elements` and update the sums accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[:negatives]))
    s2 = sum(elements[:negatives])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[i - 1]
        
        s2 -= elements[i - 1]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[negatives + i - 1]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    return max(pos)
```

Given the original code, the logic is flawed, and the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **False**
