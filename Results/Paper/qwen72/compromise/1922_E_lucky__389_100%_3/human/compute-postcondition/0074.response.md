The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `X` where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, the provided function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, the function as provided does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.**
