Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the increasing subsequences, and `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x` is 0**: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not 0. Each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`. Eventually, `x` will be reduced to 0, at which point the loop will terminate.
- **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the increasing subsequences**: During each iteration, the loop appends the value `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x\). This means that `subseq_lens` will contain the lengths of the increasing subsequences that sum up to the original value of `x`.
- **`mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`**: The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1` in each iteration. Therefore, `mx` will hold the maximum length of any subsequence that was appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's execution.
