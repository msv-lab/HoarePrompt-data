Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\).**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be the smallest integer for which \(2^i\) is greater than `x`. The other variables (`subseq_lens`, `mx`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
