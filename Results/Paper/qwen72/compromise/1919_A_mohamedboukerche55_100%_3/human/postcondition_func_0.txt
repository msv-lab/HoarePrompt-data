The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all test cases, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read during the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.
