Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum `(a + b)`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification of the Logic**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of `(a + b)` is correct because:
     - If `(a + b)` is even, the game will end with both wallets being empty on Bob's turn, making Bob the winner.
     - If `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end with both wallets being empty on Alice's turn, making Alice the winner.
   - This is because each player must remove one coin per turn, and the total number of moves is `(a + b) - 1` (since the last move will make one of the wallets empty). If `(a + b)` is even, the number of moves is odd, and Bob will make the last move. If `(a + b)` is odd, the number of moves is even, and Alice will make the last move.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly splits the input string to extract `a` and `b`.
   - It converts the extracted strings to integers, which is necessary for the arithmetic operations.
   - The use of `list(s.split())` is redundant since `s.split()` already returns a list of strings. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 (as shown in the first test case).
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)).
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified by the input format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Final: **True**
