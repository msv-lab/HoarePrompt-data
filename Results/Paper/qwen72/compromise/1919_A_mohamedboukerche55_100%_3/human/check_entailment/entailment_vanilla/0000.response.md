### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins \( a + b \) is even, the game will end in a situation where both players have an equal number of turns.
   - If the total number of coins \( a + b \) is odd, the game will end in a situation where the player who starts (Alice) will have one more turn than the other player (Bob).

3. **Key Observation:**
   - The game is symmetric in the sense that the player who starts (Alice) will always have the advantage if the total number of coins is odd.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw in terms of the number of turns, and the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to make the last move, leading to a loss for Alice.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even or odd.
   - If \( a + b \) is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If \( a + b \) is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of the program is based on the observation that the player who starts (Alice) will win if the total number of coins is odd, and lose if the total number of coins is even.
   - This logic is correct and matches the game dynamics described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
