### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet is empty and they cannot remove a coin).

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to observe the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the first move, and if the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who eventually cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice can always make the first move, and if the total number of coins is odd, Bob will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks the parity of `(a + b)` and prints "Bob" if the sum is even, and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 correctly (as shown in the example).
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the parity check is a simple and efficient operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
