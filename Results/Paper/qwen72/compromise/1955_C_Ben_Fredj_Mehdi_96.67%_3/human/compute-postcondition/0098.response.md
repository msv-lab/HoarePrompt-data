An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the points where the list `a` is accessed and modified, specifically at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These operations could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or a `ValueError` if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a`. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. Similarly, if `a[d]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the `except` block simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
