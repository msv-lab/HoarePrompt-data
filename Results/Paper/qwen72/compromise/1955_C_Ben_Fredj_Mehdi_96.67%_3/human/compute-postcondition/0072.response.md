The value of `g` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `g` was initially 0, after the increment, `g` is now 1. The integer at index 1 in `a` is now `int(a[1]) - 1`. The rest of the conditions in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, the integer at index `1` in `a` is now `int(a[1]) - 1`, the integer at index `d` in `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, and `g` is 1.**
