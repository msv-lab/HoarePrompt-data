Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times `g` was 0 during the loop, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least 2, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or a smaller value depending on how many times `a[d]` was 0 during the loop, `g` is 0 or a larger value depending on how many times `a[g]` was 0 during the loop, and the value at index `g` in the list `a` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `k` is an odd number.**
