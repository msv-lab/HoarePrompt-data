Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, `k` is not equal to 99999999999, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, `n` is not equal to 101, `k` is not equal to 100000000000, `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, `k` is not equal to 199999999999999, `k` is not equal to 1000000000000, `k` is not equal to 200000000000, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is not equal to 1000000000, `a` is not `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, `n` is not equal to 5, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 20, `k` is not equal to 10000000000, `k` is not equal to 5999999999, `k` is not equal to 4294967295, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1`, `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If no exception occurs, the integer at index `g` in `a` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`, and the integer at index `d` in `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is now `d - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is now `g + 1`. If an exception occurs, all variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: An exception in the given `try` block could occur at the points where the program attempts to access or modify the elements of the list `a` using the indices `g` and `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a` (i.e., they are negative or greater than or equal to the length of `a`), an `IndexError` would be raised. Additionally, if the elements at indices `g` or `d` are not integers, a `ValueError` might be raised when attempting to convert them to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the integers at the specified indices `g` and `d` by 1. If the value at index `g` or `d` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. If any exception occurs, the `except` block is triggered, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If no exception occurs, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the points where the list `a` is accessed and modified, specifically at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These operations could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or a `ValueError` if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a`. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. Similarly, if `a[d]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the `except` block simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
