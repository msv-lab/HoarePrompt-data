An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:

1. **Type Conversion**: When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer using `int(a[g])` or `int(a[d])`, if the value at these indices is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` might be raised.
2. **Index Out of Range**: If `g` or `d` are out of the valid range of indices for the list `a`, an `IndexError` might be raised.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. Similarly, if the value at `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs during these operations, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least 2, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or minus 2 (depending on whether `a[d]` was 0), `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` must be at least `2 * (i + 1)`. The value at index `d` in the list `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` may remain unchanged or partially updated.**
