Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is equal to 10000000000000.
   - `n` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is not 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 101.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('10000')
   ```

The print statement is simply printing the string `'10000'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement because the string `'10000'` is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **10000**
