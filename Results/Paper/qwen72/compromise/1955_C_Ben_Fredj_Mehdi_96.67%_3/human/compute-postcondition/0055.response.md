Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is not equal to 99999999999.
   - `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
   - `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 9999999999.
   - `n` is not equal to 101 or `k` is not equal to 100000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
   - `k` is not equal to 199999999999999.
   - `k` is not equal to 1000000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 200000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 2147483648 or `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to 1000000000 or `a` is not `[1000000000, 1000000000]`.
   - `n` is not equal to 5 or `k` is not equal to 2147483648.
   - `n` is not equal to 20 or `k` is not equal to 10000000000.
   - `k` is not equal to 5999999999.
   - The current value of `k` is 4294967295.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('8')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'8'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of conditions and constraints on the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these conditions affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'8'`.

Output: **8**
