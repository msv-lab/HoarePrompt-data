The value of `d` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the integer at index `d` in the list `a` is decreased by 1. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is increased by 1. `d` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, the integer at index `d` in the list `a` is decreased by 1, if `a[g]` is 0 then `g` is increased by 1, `d` is decreased by 1.**
