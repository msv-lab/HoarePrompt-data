Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first `g` elements and the last `d - g + 1` elements have been decremented by 1, and any elements that have been decremented to 0 have caused `g` to increment and `d` to decrement accordingly. The loop will terminate either when `i` reaches `k // 2` or when an exception occurs due to `g` or `d` being out of bounds. Additionally, `k` is an odd integer.**
