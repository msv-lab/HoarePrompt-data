Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 1.
2. `z` is 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
4. `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
5. `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.

### Conditions:
- If `k` is 1999999998, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied.
- If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied.
- If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the first element of `a` is 1.
- If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`.
- If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1.
- If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('99')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'99'`. The initial state and conditions provided do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **99**
