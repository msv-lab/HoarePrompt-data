Output: **1**

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string `'1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is exactly what is specified in the `print` statement, which is the string `'1'`.
