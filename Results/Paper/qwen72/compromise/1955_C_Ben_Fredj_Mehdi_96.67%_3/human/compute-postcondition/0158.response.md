Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least 2, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2, the last integer in the list `a` is 0, and if `a[0]` is 0, `g` is 1. Otherwise, `g` remains 0.**
