Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. However, the program's logic does not fully align with the problem's requirements. Here are the key points:

1. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**: The problem states that an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\) and \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)) with \(a_{i-1}\). The program does not explicitly check if the array is beautiful, but it is given that the input arrays are always beautiful.

2. **Handling All Elements the Same**: The program correctly identifies that if all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, and it outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element in the array. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - It only considers consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that no further operations can make all elements the same, not just the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\) and \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)) exists. This involves checking for the longest subarray where the middle element can be replaced, and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
