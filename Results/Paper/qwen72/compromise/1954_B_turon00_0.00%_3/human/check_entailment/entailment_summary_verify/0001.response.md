### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array:**
   - The problem states that the array is already beautiful, so we don't need to check if it is beautiful. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it stop being beautiful.

3. **Handling Arrays with All Elements the Same:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the set has only one element, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

4. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - The logic here is flawed because it only considers the segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element. It does not consider other segments or the possibility of breaking the pattern by removing elements from different segments.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.
   - However, due to the flawed logic, the output may be incorrect.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Edge Case: All Elements the Same:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.

- **General Case:**
  - The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.
  - The logic of counting consecutive elements and updating the minimum count is correct for finding the smallest segment of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the pattern.
  - However, the program only considers segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the segments of `1`s and not the `2`s, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correctness:

- **Flaw in Logic:**
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of consecutive elements. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the segments of `1`s and not the `2`s, leading to an incorrect result.
  - The correct approach should consider all segments of consecutive elements and find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible segments of consecutive elements and may miss the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

### Final: **False**
