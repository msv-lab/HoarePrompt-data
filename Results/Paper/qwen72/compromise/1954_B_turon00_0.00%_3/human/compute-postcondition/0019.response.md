Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt` (which is 2).**

The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
