The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs `-1`. This statement is independent of the initial state and the variables described in the precondition. Therefore, the output will always be `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`, or `ans`.

Output: **-1**
