Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- `ans` was initially the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.
- After executing the code, `ans` is updated to the minimum of these two values.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`) remain unchanged.
