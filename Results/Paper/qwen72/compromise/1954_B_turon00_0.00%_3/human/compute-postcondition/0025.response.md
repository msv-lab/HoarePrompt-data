Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` was either `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, or the minimum value between `n` and 2 otherwise.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` was the minimum value between `n` and 1.
- The new `ans` is the minimum of these two values.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
