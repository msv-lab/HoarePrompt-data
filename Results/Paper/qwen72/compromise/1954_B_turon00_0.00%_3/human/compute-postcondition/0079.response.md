Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the value of `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
