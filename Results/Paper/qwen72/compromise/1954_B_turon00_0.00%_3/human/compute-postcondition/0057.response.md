Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, updating `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `cnt` keeps track of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` (the first element of `a`) in the list `a`.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt` whenever a different element is encountered.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- `cnt` will be the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.
- `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`.
- If all elements in `a` are the same (`len(aa) == 1`), `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.
