Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

   To determine `ans`, we need to consider the following:
   - We start from the end of the list `a` and count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - We then find the minimum count of such consecutive elements in the list `a`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`, the value of `ans` will be a non-negative integer.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific elements in the list `a` and their distribution.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to tmp found in the list a)**
