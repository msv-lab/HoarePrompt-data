Output State: **The code snippet `dx, dy = b` will result in an error because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged: `a` and `b` are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, such that 0 <= a, b <= 10000.**
