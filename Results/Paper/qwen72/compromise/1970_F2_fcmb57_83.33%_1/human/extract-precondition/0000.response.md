Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, such that 0 <= a, b <= 10000.**

However, this precondition does not fully capture the complexity of the problem as described. A more accurate precondition for the function that would handle the game logic based on the provided problem description would be:

Precondition: **N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99, representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field. a is a list of strings, each string representing a row of the field with M pairs of characters, where each pair can be ".." (empty cell), "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). b is an integer such that 0 <= b <= 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. The following b lines each contain a valid action for an entity on the field, as described in the problem.**

Given the function definition provided does not match the complexity of the problem, the function should likely be defined as follows to match the problem description:

```python
def quidditch_game(N, M, field, T, actions):
```

With the precondition adjusted accordingly.
