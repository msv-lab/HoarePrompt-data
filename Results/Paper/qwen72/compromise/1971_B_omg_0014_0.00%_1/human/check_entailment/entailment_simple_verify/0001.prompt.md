You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set will contain all unique characters in `s`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the length of the set `a` is exactly 2. If it is, it prints "NO" because a string with exactly two unique characters cannot be rearranged to form a string that is different from the original.
   - If the length of the set `a` is not 2, it proceeds to the next steps.

4. **String Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the string `s` in ascending order and stores it in `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in descending order and stores it in `c`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reverse sorted string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness for Strings with Unique Characters:**
  - If the string `s` has more than 2 unique characters, the program will always find a valid rearrangement. Sorting the string in ascending or descending order will produce a different string unless the original string was already sorted in that order.
  - For example, if `s = "codeforces"`, the sorted string `b` will be `"cdefoorces"`, which is different from `s`.

- **Correctness for Strings with Exactly 2 Unique Characters:**
  - If the string `s` has exactly 2 unique characters, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly identifies this and prints "NO".
  - For example, if `s = "xxxxx"`, the set `a` will have only one unique character, and the program will print "NO".

- **Correctness for Strings with a Single Unique Character:**
  - If the string `s` has only one unique character, the set `a` will have a length of 1. The program will not enter the "NO" condition because it checks for a length of 2. However, since the string is already the same regardless of sorting, it will print the reverse sorted string `c`, which is the same as `s`.
  - For example, if `s = "d"`, the program will print "YES" and then "d", which is correct according to the problem statement.

- **Correctness for Strings with More Than 2 Unique Characters:**
  - If the string `s` has more than 2 unique characters, the program will print "YES" and then either the sorted string `b` or the reverse sorted string `c`, depending on which one is different from `s`.
  - For example, if `s = "nutdealer"`, the sorted string `b` will be `"adeelmnrtu"`, which is different from `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for strings with more than 2 unique characters, it outputs a valid rearrangement. For strings with exactly 2 unique characters, it correctly identifies that no valid rearrangement is possible. For strings with a single unique character, it outputs the same string, which is also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
