You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. If the string `s` contains more than two distinct characters, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of the string `s`, depending on whether the sorted string `s` is equal to the original string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when the string `s` has more than 2 distinct characters but all possible rearrangements of `s` result in a string that is equal to `s`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
abc
def
ghi
```

For the string `abc`, the program will output:
```
YES
abc
```

However, this is incorrect because `abc` is equal to the original string `s`. The correct output should be a rearranged string that is not equal to `abc`, such as `bac`.

Similarly, for the strings `def` and `ghi`, the program will output the same string, which is not a valid rearrangement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
