The function `jewels` should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function should determine if it is possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels using her n coins.
