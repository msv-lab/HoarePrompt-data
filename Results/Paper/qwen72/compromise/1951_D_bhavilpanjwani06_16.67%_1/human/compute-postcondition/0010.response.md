Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- `n` and `k` are the input integers, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the current value of `k` is such that `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k` as long as the conditions are met.

### Explanation:
- The conditions `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` are given to ensure that the values of `n` and `k` are within certain constraints. However, these constraints do not influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs a fixed string.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
