The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cases` contains two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to 10^18.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a tuple in the `cases` list. The result for each tuple `(n, k)` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a tuple in `cases`.**
