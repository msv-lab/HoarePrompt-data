Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
   - `n` and `k` are the input integers.
   - `n` is equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `n` is defined as one of the integers in the tuples within the `cases` list.
   - According to the precondition, `n` is equal to `k` for each tuple in the `cases` list.
   - Therefore, `n` is a positive integer that is equal to `k` and both are within the range 1 to 10^18.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is a positive integer equal to `k`.

Output: **n (where n is a positive integer equal to k and both are within the range 1 to 10^18)**
