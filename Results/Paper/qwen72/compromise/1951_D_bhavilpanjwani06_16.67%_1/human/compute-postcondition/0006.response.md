The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
   - `n` and `k` are the input integers, and it is given that `n` is equal to `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It is a straightforward print of the integer `1`.
- Therefore, the output will always be `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, or `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
