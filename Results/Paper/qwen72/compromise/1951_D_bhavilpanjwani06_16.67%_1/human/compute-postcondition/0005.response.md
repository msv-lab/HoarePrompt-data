Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- For each tuple in `cases`, `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet you provided is:
```
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
