### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.
   - The program checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and `n`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with price `n` per jewel, spending all her coins.
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, the program checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
   - If the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is false, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible configurations of stalls and prices that could allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The condition `n < k` correctly identifies cases where it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels.
   - The condition `n == k` correctly identifies cases where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall.
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to determine if it is impossible to set up the stalls. There are many other configurations that could allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, even if this condition is false.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 3`, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by 10 and the prices `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`. This is a valid configuration because Alice can buy 3 jewels from the first stall.
   - For the input `6 4`, the program prints "NO", which is incorrect. It is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels. For example, stalls with prices `2 2 2 2` would work.
   - For the input `255 8`, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by 8 and the prices `128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1`. This is a valid configuration because Alice can buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where it is possible to set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is too restrictive and does not consider all valid configurations.

### Correctness: **False**
