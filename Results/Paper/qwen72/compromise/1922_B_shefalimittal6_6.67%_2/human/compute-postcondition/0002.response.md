Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the final state is as follows:**

- `t` is 0 (since the loop has finished executing all `t` test cases).
- `n` is the last value of `n` read from the input for the final test case.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the counts of each integer in the last test case's list `nums`.
- `nums` is the last list of integers read from the input for the final test case.
- `res` is the final result calculated for the last test case, which is the sum of the number of valid triplets and pairs as described in the loop.
- The loop has printed the value of `res` for each test case.

The state of other variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
