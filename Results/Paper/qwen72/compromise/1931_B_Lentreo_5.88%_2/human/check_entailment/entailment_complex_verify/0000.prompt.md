You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers (nums). It then calculates the difference between each non-zero element in nums and the last element in nums, accumulating these differences in curr. If curr is 0 after the inner loop, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`. The function then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` are no longer accessible as they are local to the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between the last element and the other elements, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of equalizing the water levels.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 2 3
```

For the first test case:
- `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- The last element is `3`.
- The program will calculate `curr` as `1 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 3 - 3 = -3`, which is not zero.
- The program will output `NO`, which is incorrect because it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit from the third container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

For the second test case:
- `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3]`
- The last element is `3`.
- The program will calculate `curr` as `1 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 3 - 3 = -4`, which is not zero.
- The program will output `NO`, which is incorrect because it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit from the fourth container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for these test cases.
