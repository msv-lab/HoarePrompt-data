To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other details about the constraints and the list `r` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
