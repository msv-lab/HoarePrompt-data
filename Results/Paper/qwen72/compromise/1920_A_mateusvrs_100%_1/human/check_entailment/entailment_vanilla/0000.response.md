### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Values:**
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid values for `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 Constraints (k >= x):** The function correctly updates `bx` to the maximum of the given `x` values.
- **Type 2 Constraints (k <= x):** The function correctly updates `ax` to the minimum of the given `x` values.
- **Type 3 Constraints (k != x):** The function correctly adds these values to the set `cx` and later checks if they fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- **Feasibility Check:** The function correctly checks if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid (i.e., `bx` <= `ax`).
- **Counting Valid Values:** The function correctly counts the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range from the total number of integers in the range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
