Correctness: **True**

The program provided by Alex is correct for the given problem. It processes multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints on an integer \( k \). The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum bounds for \( k \) from the constraints of type 1 and type 2, respectively. It then accounts for the constraints of type 3 by excluding the values that \( k \) cannot take within the identified range. The logic for calculating the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints is sound and matches the problem description. The program also handles the edge case where the minimum bound exceeds the maximum bound, correctly returning 0 in such scenarios. Thus, the program is expected to work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem.
