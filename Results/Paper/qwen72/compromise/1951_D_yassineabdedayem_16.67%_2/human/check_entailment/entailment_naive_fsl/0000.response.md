Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `k` but `k` can still be achieved by setting up multiple stalls with different prices. For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program will output "NO" because it does not find a way to distribute the prices such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. However, a valid solution exists: Bob can set up 3 stalls with prices 1, 3, and 6. Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, spending 10 coins in total and buying exactly 3 jewels. This shows that the program is not correctly identifying all possible valid cases.
