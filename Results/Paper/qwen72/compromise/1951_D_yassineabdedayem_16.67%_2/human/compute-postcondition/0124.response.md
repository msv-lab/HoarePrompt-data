Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` is updated to `Max`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
  - `t` is still greater than 0.
  - `n` is still `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`.
  - `k` is still a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`.
  - `rep` is still 1.
  - `tab` is still a list containing the string representation of `number`, but now `number` is `Max`.
  - `Min` is still `min(n // k, k)`.
  - `Max` is still `max(int(n / k), k)`.
  - `k` is still `k - Min`.
