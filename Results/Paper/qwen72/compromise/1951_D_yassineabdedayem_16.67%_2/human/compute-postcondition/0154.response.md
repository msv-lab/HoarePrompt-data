Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is 0 or a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `rep` is the total number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` contains at least `rep` elements, and the elements of `tab` have been printed. If `k` is a positive integer, `tab` contains the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop, and the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed all `t` test cases. The variable `n` will be 0 or a non-negative integer, and `k` will be 0 or a positive integer, depending on the final state of the loop. The variable `rep` will be the total number of times the inner loop executed, which is at most 60. The list `tab` will contain the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the inner loop. If `k` is 0, all elements in `tab` have been printed, indicating that the loop successfully executed all iterations. If `k` is a positive integer, the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true, and the elements in `tab` have not been printed.
