Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0 and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition about `k` and the loop operations remain valid as they were in the initial state.
