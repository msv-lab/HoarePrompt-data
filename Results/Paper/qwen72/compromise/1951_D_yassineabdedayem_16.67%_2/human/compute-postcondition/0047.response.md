Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of `number` values.
   - `i` is the third element of `tab`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is defined as the third element of the list `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list that contains at least three string representations of `number` values.
   - Since `i` is the third element of `tab`, it will be the string representation of the third `number` value in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the third element of `tab` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given the initial state, the third element of `tab` is a string representation of a `number` value. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **[third element of tab] (where the third element of tab is a string representation of a number value)**
