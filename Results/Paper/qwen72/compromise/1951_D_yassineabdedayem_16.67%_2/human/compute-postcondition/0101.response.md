Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer.
- `k` is 0 or a positive integer.
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers.
- The loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.
- Additionally, `k` is a positive integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and conditions, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The loop stopping condition (`n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60`) is no longer true, which means one of these conditions is false:
  - `n == 0`
  - `k == 0`
  - `rep == 60`

However, since `k` is explicitly stated to be a positive integer, `k > 0` is always true. Therefore, the loop must have stopped because either `n == 0` or `rep == 60`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'` regardless of the specific values of `n`, `k`, `rep`, or `tab`.

Output: **NO**
