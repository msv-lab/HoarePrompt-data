Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `Max` equals `k`, `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, and `k` is now `k - k`.**

In natural language: `k` is updated to `k - k`, which means `k` is now 0. All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.
