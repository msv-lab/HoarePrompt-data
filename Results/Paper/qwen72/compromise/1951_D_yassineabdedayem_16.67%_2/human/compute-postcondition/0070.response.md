Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- `Min` and `Max` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
- `n` is then updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` is still valid.
