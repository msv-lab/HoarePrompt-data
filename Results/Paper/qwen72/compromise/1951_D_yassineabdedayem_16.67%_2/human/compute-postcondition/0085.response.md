Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `n - Min * Max` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string representations, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`. `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`.***
