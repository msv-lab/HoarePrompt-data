Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is `Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` equals `k`, `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is now `k - k` which is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now 0 because it was updated to `k - k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
