Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `k` must be a positive integer, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

The value of `number` is updated to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
