Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the integer value input by the user, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0 and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers. If `k` is 0, the loop has finished executing all elements in `tab`. If `k` is a positive integer, the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` must have at least `rep` elements, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. If `k` is a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
