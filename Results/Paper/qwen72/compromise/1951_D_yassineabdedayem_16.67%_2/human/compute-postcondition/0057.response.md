To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input
- `rep` is 0
- `number` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `tab` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n != 0`**: This condition requires `n` to be non-zero. Since `n` is updated from input, we need to ensure that the input value for `n` is not zero.
2. **`k > 0`**: This condition requires `k` to be greater than zero. Since `k` is also updated from input, we need to ensure that the input value for `k` is greater than zero.
3. **`rep < 60`**: This condition is already satisfied because `rep` is 0, which is less than 60.
4. **`n >= k`**: This condition requires `n` to be greater than or equal to `k`. We need to ensure that the input value for `n` is greater than or equal to the input value for `k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be a non-zero integer.
- `k` must be a positive integer.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `k` must be a positive integer, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is an empty list**.
