Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing three string representations, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`.**
