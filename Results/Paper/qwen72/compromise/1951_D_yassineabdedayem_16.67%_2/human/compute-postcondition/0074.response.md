Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is now `k - Min`, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- The list `tab` still contains a single string representation of `Max`.
- The value of `n` is still `n - Min * Max`.
- The conditions `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `rep` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than `Min` are still valid.
