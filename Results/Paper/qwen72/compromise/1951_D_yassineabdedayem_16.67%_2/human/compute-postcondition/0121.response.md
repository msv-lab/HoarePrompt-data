Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)` updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the current values of `n` and `k`. The new value of `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and the new value of `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number`) remain unchanged, but the conditions for `number` and `k` are still valid based on the updated values of `Min` and `Max`.
