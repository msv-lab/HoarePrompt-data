Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.***
