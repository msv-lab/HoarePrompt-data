Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value, `i` is the first element of `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number` values, `i` is the second element of `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of `number` values, `i` is the third element of `tab`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
