Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) retain their initial values or conditions.
