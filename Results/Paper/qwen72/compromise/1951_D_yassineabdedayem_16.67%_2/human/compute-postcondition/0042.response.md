The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list `tab` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop. For the loop to execute, `tab` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value, `i` is the first element of `tab`**
