Postcondition: **After all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0.**
