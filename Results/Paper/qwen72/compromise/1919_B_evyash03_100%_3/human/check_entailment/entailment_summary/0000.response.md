Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty subarrays, and the penalty is defined as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length. The program does not attempt to split the array or calculate the penalties of the subarrays; it simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct solution.

For example:
- In the third test case, the input is `"+-+-+-`". The optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`. However, the program will return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.
- In the fourth test case, the input is `"--+++++++-"`. The optimal split is `([-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of `2 + 2 = 4`. The program will return `abs(1 - 9) = 8`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
