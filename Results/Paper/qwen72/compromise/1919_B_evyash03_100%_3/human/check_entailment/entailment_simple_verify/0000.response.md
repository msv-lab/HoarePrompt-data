### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then calculates the number of '-' characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, `abs(sub - count)`.

3. **Evaluation of the Program**:
   - The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays.
   - It does not calculate the penalty for each subarray.
   - Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to finding the minimum possible penalty.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
   - The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`.
   - However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then returns `abs(0 - 6) = 6`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is fundamentally different from the problem's requirements.
   - It does not perform the necessary steps to split the array and calculate the penalty for each subarray.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
