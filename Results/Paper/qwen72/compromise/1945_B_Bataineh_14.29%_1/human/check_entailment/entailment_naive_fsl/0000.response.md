Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Specifically, the program incorrectly adds 2 to the result without considering the actual timing and overlap of the fireworks.

A correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. Additionally, the visibility period of each firework should be taken into account to ensure that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is accurately calculated.

Here is a test case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `4`

In this case, the program incorrectly adds 2 to the result, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output should be 3 because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
- The visibility period is 4 minutes (from `x` to `x + 3`).

At time 2, the fireworks launched at times 0, 1, and 2 from the first installation and the firework launched at time 0 from the second installation are all visible, resulting in a maximum of 3 fireworks visible simultaneously. The program's output of 4 is incorrect.
