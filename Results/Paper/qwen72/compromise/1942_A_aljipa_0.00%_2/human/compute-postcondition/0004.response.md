Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. **
