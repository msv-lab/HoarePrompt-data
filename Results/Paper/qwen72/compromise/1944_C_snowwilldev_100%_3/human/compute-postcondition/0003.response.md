The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, so it should be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0**
