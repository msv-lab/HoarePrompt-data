Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `z` is 3, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `z` is 2. Since `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, it implies that `k - 1` is at least 1 and at most 29. Therefore, `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 or 1. Adding 1 to this result and then to the initial value of `z` (which is 2) gives a new value of `z` as 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
