Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.** 

The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided by the input, and the initial state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. The loop condition for `_` being less than `t` is still valid.
