Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `z` is 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- `z` is initially 1.
- The expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is evaluated.
- `z // (k - 1)` is 1 // (k - 1), which is 0 because `k` is at least 2, making `k - 1` at least 1, and 1 divided by any integer greater than or equal to 1 is 0.
- Therefore, `z += 0 + 1` results in `z` being incremented by 1, making `z` equal to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
