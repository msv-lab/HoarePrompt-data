The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `x + 1`, which means `x` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 2 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is 2, `i` is 2**
