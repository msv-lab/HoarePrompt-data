Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `a` is less than `z`.**
