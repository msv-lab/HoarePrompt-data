Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function evaluates a condition based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Specifically, if `x` is less than `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is at least `x + 1`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is at least `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and checks if `a` is at least `z`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
