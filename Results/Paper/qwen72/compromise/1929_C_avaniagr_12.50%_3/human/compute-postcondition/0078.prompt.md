Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `k + 2`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is set to `x + 1`, `i` is set to `x`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `x` < `k` - 1, the loop continues regardless of whether `a` >= `x` + 1 or `a` < `x` + 1. If `x` == `k` - 1, the condition for the loop remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is the result of the loop after `x` + 1 iterations, `i` is `x`, and the relationship between `a` and `z` is preserved: if `a` >= `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; if `a` < `z`, then `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, and `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `x` < `k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, regardless of the value of `a`. If `x` == `k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, regardless of the value of `a`. If `x` > `k - 1`, `z` is set to `x + 1`, `i` is set to `x`, and if `a` >= `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` < `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
