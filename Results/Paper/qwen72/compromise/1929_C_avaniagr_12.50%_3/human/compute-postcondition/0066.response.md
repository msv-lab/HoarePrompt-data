The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `x` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1**
