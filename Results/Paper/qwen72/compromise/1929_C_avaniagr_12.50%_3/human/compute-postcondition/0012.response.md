Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30.
- `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100.
- `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9.
- `_` is a placeholder that will be set by the loop.
- `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- The value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `x` is set to `k - 1`. Given that `2 <= k <= 30`, it follows that `1 <= x <= 29`.
   - `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Since `1 <= x <= 29`, it follows that `a >= 4` (when `x = 1`) and `a >= 32` (when `x = 29`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `_` because the string is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
