Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that `l` is now assigned the value 0, and `r` is now assigned the value `n` - 1.
