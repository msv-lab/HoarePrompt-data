Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer - 1.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.
4. `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
5. `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
6. `i` is `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `n % 2` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
   - This means we count how many elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` are equal to `a[mdx]`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `n = 5` (an odd number).
     - `mdx = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`.
     - If `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `a[mdx] = a[2] = 3`.
     - The elements from index `2` to `4` are `[3, 3, 3]`.
     - All three elements are equal to `3`, so `res = 3`.

   - Let's assume `n = 6` (an even number).
     - `mdx = 6 // 2 + 6 % 2 - 1 = 3 + 0 - 1 = 2`.
     - If `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, then `a[mdx] = a[2] = 3`.
     - The elements from index `2` to `5` are `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
     - Three elements are equal to `3`, so `res = 3`.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the number of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The value of `mdx` is determined by the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements in the specified range that match `a[mdx]`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, and `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`)**
