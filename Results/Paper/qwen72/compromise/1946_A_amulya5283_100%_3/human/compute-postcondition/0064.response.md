Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 3.
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.
4. `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
5. `i` is `n - 1`.
6. `n` must be greater than `mdx`.
7. `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This formula essentially finds the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
   - For example:
     - If `n` is 5 (odd), `mdx` = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.
     - If `n` is 6 (even), `mdx` = 6 // 2 + 6 % 2 - 1 = 3 + 0 - 1 = 2.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.

3. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` counts the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.
   - This means we are counting how many times the element at the middle index (or just before the middle index if `n` is even) appears in the second half of the list.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `a` is a sorted list of integers and `n` is the length of `a`.

- If `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`:
  - `n = 5`
  - `mdx = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2`
  - `i = 5 - 1 = 4`
  - The element at index `mdx` (index 2) is `3`.
  - We count how many times `3` appears from index 2 to index 4.
  - The elements from index 2 to index 4 are `[3, 3, 3]`.
  - `res` = 3 (since `3` appears 3 times).

- If `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`:
  - `n = 6`
  - `mdx = 6 // 2 + 6 % 2 - 1 = 2`
  - `i = 6 - 1 = 5`
  - The element at index `mdx` (index 2) is `3`.
  - We count how many times `3` appears from index 2 to index 5.
  - The elements from index 2 to index 5 are `[3, 4, 5, 5]`.
  - `res` = 1 (since `3` appears 1 time).

### General Case:
- `mdx` is the middle index or just before the middle index.
- `i` is the last index of the list.
- `res` counts the occurrences of the element at `mdx` from `mdx` to `i`.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`)**
