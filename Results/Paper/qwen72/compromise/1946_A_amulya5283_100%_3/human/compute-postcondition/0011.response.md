To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop starts with `i` being initialized to `mdx`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer - 1 (This is not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input (This is not relevant to the loop head).
   - `res` is 0 (This is not relevant to the loop head).
   - `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `mdx` must be less than `n`.
   - `i` must start at `mdx` and be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Ensuring `mdx` is Less Than `n`**:
   - Given `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that `mdx` is a valid starting point for the loop.
   - For `n` not equal to 1, `n // 2` will be at least 0, and `n % 2` will be either 0 or 1.
   - Therefore, `mdx` will be at least -1 (if `n` is 1, but `n` is not 1), and typically it will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` should start at `mdx`.
   - `mdx` should be less than `n`.

Given these considerations, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`**.
