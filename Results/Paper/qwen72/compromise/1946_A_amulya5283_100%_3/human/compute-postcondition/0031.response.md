The code snippet `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` calculates the value of `mdx` based on the value of `n`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2.
2. `n % 2` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
3. `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` combines these results to determine `mdx`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.
- `res` is 0.

The value of `mdx` is calculated as follows:
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx = n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx = n // 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**
