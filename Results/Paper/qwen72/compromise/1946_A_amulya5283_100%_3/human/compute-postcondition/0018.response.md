The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` equal to `mdx` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, continuing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer - 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input (unchanged)
- `res` is 0 or 1, or if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 1 or 2 (unchanged)
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` (unchanged)
- `i` is `mdx + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now `mdx + 2`
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`

State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0 or 1, or if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 1 or 2, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`**
