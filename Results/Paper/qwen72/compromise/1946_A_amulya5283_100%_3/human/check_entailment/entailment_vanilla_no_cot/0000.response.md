Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the median index `mdx` using `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is correct for finding the median in a sorted array.

2. **Operation Counting**:
   - The program then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array and counts how many elements are equal to the current median value. This logic is flawed because it does not actually determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - To increase the median, you need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and determine how many operations are needed to make the current median equal to this next number.
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but since we are only allowed to increase elements, we need to focus on the right middle element.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[2, 2, 8]`, the median is `2`. To increase the median, we need to increase the middle element `2` to `3` (the next smallest number greater than `2`), which requires 1 operation. The program correctly outputs `1`.
   - For the array `[7, 3, 3, 1]`, the median is `3`. To increase the median, we need to increase one of the `3`s to `4` (the next smallest number greater than `3`), which requires 1 operation. However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.
   - For the array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`, the median is `5`. To increase the median, we need to increase one of the `5`s to `6` (the next smallest number greater than `5`), which requires 1 operation. However, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would involve finding the next smallest number greater than the current median and calculating the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this next number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            median = a[mdx]
            next_median = median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] == median:
                next_median = max(next_median, a[mdx] + 1)
                mdx += 1
            if mdx == n:
                next_median = median + 1
            operations = (next_median - median) * (n // 2 + n % 2)
            print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
