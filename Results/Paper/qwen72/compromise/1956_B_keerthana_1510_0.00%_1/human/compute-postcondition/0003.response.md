Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from standard input, processes each test case (skipping the first and every second line), and prints the sum of the counts of each unique element in the list of elements from the line, divided by 3. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` mentioned in the annotations are not directly used or modified by the function. **
