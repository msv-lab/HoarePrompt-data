Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program counts the number of times each element appears in the list and divides it by 3, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires a more complex strategy to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
1
```
However, the program will output:
```
0
```
This is because the program does not account for the game's rules and the optimal strategy for both players. It simply divides the count of each element by 3, which is incorrect for this problem.
