You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in each test case, and a list of lists a where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 100. `n` remains the same input integer. `a` remains the same list of integers input by the user. `ans` remains 0.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3, while `cnt`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each value in cnt by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of sticks, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from the user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function calculates the number of complete sets of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed count of such sets, while the variables `n`, `a`, and the internal dictionary `cnt` used for counting are no longer accessible outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of sticks of a certain length is not a multiple of 3 but can still form a polygon. For example, if there are 4 sticks of the same length, the program will only count 1 polygon (since 4 // 3 = 1), but it should actually count 1 polygon (a square) because 4 sticks can form a regular polygon with 4 sides. This means the program is not correctly calculating the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
4
2 2 2 2

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
1
```
The program outputs 1, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed. For a more clear example:
```
Input:
1
8
2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
2
```
The program outputs 2, which is correct, but it does not correctly handle the case where the number of sticks is not a multiple of 3. For instance:
```
Input:
1
5
2 2 2 2 2

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
1
```
The program outputs 1, but it should output 1 because 5 sticks can form a pentagon. The program's logic of `x // 3` is incorrect for this scenario.
