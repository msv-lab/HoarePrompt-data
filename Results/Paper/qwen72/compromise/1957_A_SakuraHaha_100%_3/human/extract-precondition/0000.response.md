Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in each test case, and a list of lists a where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the precondition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a_list):
```

Here, `t` is the number of test cases, `n_list` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of sticks in a test case, and `a_list` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the lengths of the sticks for a corresponding test case.
