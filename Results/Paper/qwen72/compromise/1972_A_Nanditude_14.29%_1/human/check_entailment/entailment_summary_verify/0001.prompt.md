You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns the list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order. The original lists `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations are not affected by this function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both arrays `a` and `b` until either `i` or `j` reaches `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`:
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.
     - The program then removes the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem) using `a.pop(-1)`.
     - It inserts the new problem with difficulty `b[j]` at the correct position in `a` to maintain the non-decreasing order.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is acceptable, and both `i` and `j` are moved to the next positions.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the number of new problems proposed for each test case.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. This function sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies when a problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.
   - It ensures that the new problem is inserted in the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order of `a`.
   - The program correctly counts the number of new problems needed and prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the way the new problem is inserted into the array `a`. The current implementation uses `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]`, which is not efficient for large arrays. A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search to find the correct insertion point and then insert the new problem.

Despite this inefficiency, the logic of the program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
