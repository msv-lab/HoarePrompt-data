Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads a binary string `s` from the user.
   - **Processing**:
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '0' to the front, and the cost is the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0'.
   - **Output**: The function prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Processing**:
     - It iterates `t` times.
     - In each iteration, it calls `func_1` to process a single test case.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the cost of sorting the binary string by counting the number of '1's and adding the cost for each '0' that appears after a '1'.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted to move the '0' to the front.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the program processes each test case independently.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem as described. `func_2` handles the input and iteration over multiple test cases, while `func_1` calculates the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The program meets the input and output requirements specified in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
