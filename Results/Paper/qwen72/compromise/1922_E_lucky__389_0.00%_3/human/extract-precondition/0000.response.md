Precondition: **The function should accept an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, X):` where t is the number of test cases and X is the integer for each test case.**
