Output State: **The function should accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, X):` where t is the number of test cases and X is the integer for each test case. `x` is an input integer.**
