Output State: **`x` is now equal to `x - (2 ** i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values `[1, i]`, `mx` is `1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} - 1 \leq x\) before the update, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - (2 ** i - 1)`.
- The list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged, containing the values `[1, i]`.
- The variable `mx` remains `1`.
- The value of `i` remains the largest integer such that \(2^{i} - 1 \leq x\) before the update, and `i` is still not equal to 0.
