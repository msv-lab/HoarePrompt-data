Postcondition: ***`x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2^i - 1`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i - 1 <= x`. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is now `x - (2^i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, and `mx` is `i`.***
