Initial State: `x` is now equal to `x - 2`

```
mx = max(mx, i)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `mx` or `i`, so we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`x` is now equal to `x - 2`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
