Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.
   - `ansv` must have at least 1 element.
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is set to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the `subseq_lens` list.
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the `ansv` list.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `i` is the last index of `subseq_lens`, the element `ansv[i]` will be the last element of the `ansv` list.
   - The exact value of `ansv[i]` is not provided in the initial state, but we know it must be at least the first element of `ansv` because `ansv` has at least 1 element.

Therefore, the output will be the last element of the `ansv` list followed by a space.

Output: **[last element of ansv] **
