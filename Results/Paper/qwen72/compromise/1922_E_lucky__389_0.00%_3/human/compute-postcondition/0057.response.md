Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with `subseq_lens[1]` and `subseq_lens[2]` appended, `i` is 2**. 

The value of `ansv` has been updated by appending the value of `subseq_lens[2]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
