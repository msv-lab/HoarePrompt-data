Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{i} - 1\), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values `[1, i]`, `mx` is `1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} - 1 \leq x\), and `i` is not equal to 0.**

The value of `i` is appended to the list `subseq_lens`, which initially contained the value `1`. Therefore, `subseq_lens` now contains the values `[1, i]`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
