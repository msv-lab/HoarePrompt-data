The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` holds true.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.

Let's evaluate the condition with the current values:
- `2 ** (1 + 1) = 2 ** 2 = 4`
- `x + 1` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the condition to hold true.

Since `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, we need to adjust `x` to ensure that `x + 1` is at least 4. Therefore, `x` must be at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is `i`, and `i` is 1**
