The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `ansv`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and the list `ansv` must have at least one more element to ensure that the loop can continue.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, and `ansv` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(subseq_lens)`, and `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 1` elements.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 1` elements, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)`**
