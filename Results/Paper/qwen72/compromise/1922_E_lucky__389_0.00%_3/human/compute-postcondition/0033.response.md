Output State: **`x` is now `x - (2^i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i - 1 <= x`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting `2^i - 1` from its current value. The list `subseq_lens` still contains the value of `i`, `mx` remains 0, and `i` is still the largest integer such that `2^i - 1` is less than or equal to the new value of `x`. `i` is not equal to 0.
