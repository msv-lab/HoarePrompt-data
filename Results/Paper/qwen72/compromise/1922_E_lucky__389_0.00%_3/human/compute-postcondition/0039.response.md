Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is `i`, and `i` is 1.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged, with `subseq_lens` still containing the value of `i` (which was 0 before the increment). `mx` is still equal to `i`, but `i` is now 1.
