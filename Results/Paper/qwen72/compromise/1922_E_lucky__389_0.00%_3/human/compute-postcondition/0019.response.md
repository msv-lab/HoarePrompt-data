Postcondition: **The function accepts an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list if `i` is 0, otherwise it contains the value `i`. `mx` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise it is the maximum of its original value and `i`. `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1. If `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2`.**
