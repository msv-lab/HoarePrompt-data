You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, processes it to generate a list `ansv` of integers, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum length of sub-sequences found during processing) and additional elements from the list `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element). The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, and `ansv` contains the specified elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should be such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to process the integer \( X \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the integer \( X \) and subtracts 1 from it.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of terms of the form \( 2^i - 1 \).
   - For each term \( 2^i - 1 \) found, it appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( X \).
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - Then, it appends the elements from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element) to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Subsequence Count Calculation**:
     - The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of terms of the form \( 2^i - 1 \). This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
     - The loop ensures that the largest possible \( 2^i - 1 \) is subtracted from \( X \) at each step, which is a greedy approach to decompose \( X \).
   - **Array Construction**:
     - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`. This ensures that the initial part of the array has the necessary increasing subsequences.
     - The elements from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element) are appended to `ansv`. This is done to ensure that the array has the exact number of increasing subsequences as \( X \).
   - **Output**:
     - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly by outputting a single element array.
   - The program should handle larger values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) and ensure that the array length does not exceed 200.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. According to the problem, \( X \) is at least 2, so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the array length exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the greedy approach, the array length should not exceed 200.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by decomposing \( X \) into a sum of terms of the form \( 2^i - 1 \) and constructing the array accordingly. The output format is correct, and the program should handle the given constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
