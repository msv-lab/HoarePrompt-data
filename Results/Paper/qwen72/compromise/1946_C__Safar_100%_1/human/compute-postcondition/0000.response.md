Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b, representing the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.** 

The variable `g` is now a list containing `n + 1` empty lists. Each element in `g` is an empty list, and the length of `g` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `edges`) remain unchanged.
