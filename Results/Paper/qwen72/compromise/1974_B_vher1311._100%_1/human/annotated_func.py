#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of the `r` string in reverse order, as defined by the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters of `encoded` in reverse order, as defined by a mapping dictionary. The final state of the program is that the original `encoded` string is transformed into this new string, with the characters replaced according to the specified mapping.
