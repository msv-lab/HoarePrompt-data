Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and the encoded string `b`).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting and removing duplicate characters from `b`.
   - It creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the mapping.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them separated by newlines.

The program follows the encoding and decoding logic as described in the problem statement and handles the input and output correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
