### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The construction of `r` ensures that all distinct characters from `b` are included and sorted in alphabetical order.
   - The mapping dictionary correctly pairs each character in `r` with its symmetric character.
   - The decoding process correctly applies the mapping to each character in `b`, restoring the original string `s`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters and strings of varying lengths as described in the problem constraints.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them all at once, which is efficient and matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` for each test case, following the specified algorithm and handling all edge cases appropriately.
