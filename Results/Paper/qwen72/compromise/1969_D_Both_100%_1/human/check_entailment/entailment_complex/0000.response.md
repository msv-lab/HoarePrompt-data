Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input using `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the number of test cases, and `func_2` reads the integers for each test case, converting them into lists of integers.

2. **Data Preparation**: The program prepares the data by creating a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice and the bonus for Bob. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap for efficient selection of items.

3. **Heap Initialization**: The program initializes a heap with the first `k` items from the sorted `combined` list. This ensures that Bob can take the `k` most valuable items for free, minimizing Alice's profit.

4. **Profit Calculation**: The program calculates the initial profit using `func_3`, which sums the profits for the remaining items. It then iterates through the remaining items, updating the heap and the current profit to find the maximum possible profit.

5. **Optimization**: The program uses a heap to efficiently manage the selection of items, ensuring that Bob always takes the `k` most valuable items for free, and Alice maximizes her profit by selling the remaining items.

6. **Output**: The program prints the maximum profit for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions work together to handle the input, process the data, and compute the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
