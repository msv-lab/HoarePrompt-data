You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases, each involving a set of items with associated prices and bonuses. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by selecting up to `k` items, considering both the negative prices (Alice's payments) and bonuses (Bob's payments). The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the internal state reset for the next call, with `test_cases` reduced to 0 and other internal variables cleared or reset to their initial states.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` items, each having different prices for Alice (`a_i`) and Bob (`b_i`).
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she pays for the items.
   - Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys at least `k` items, and he will choose the items that minimize Alice's profit.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input using custom functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
   - It sorts the items based on Bob's prices and pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
   - It calculates the initial profit and then iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap as necessary.
   - The final maximum profit is printed for each test case.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Reading Input**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the number of test cases and the input values for each test case.
   - **Heap Initialization**: A heap is used to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free. This ensures that Bob always takes the items that minimize Alice's profit.
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit for a given set of primary and secondary items.
     - The main loop in `func_4` processes each test case, sorting the items and pushing the first `k` items into the heap.
     - It then iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure Bob's optimal choice.
   - **Output**: The maximum profit is printed for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The use of a heap ensures that Bob always takes the items that minimize Alice's profit, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The program uses a greedy approach combined with a heap to ensure that both Alice and Bob act optimally.
   - The sorting and heap operations are efficient, making the solution suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the algorithm ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally.
