The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs the following actions:

1. It pushes the `item` onto the heap.
2. It simultaneously pops and returns the smallest element from the heap.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list, where each element is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus.
- `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Pushing `item` onto the heap**:
   - The `item` is added to the heap, which is a min-heap (since `heapq` maintains a min-heap).
   - This operation ensures that the heap remains a valid min-heap.

2. **Popping the smallest element**:
   - The smallest element in the heap (based on the first element of the tuple, which is the negated price) is popped and returned.
   - This element is assigned to `removed_item`.

### Impact on Variables:

- **`heap`**: The heap is modified by adding `item` and removing the smallest element. The size of the heap remains the same (still contains `k` elements).
- **`removed_item`**: This variable now holds the smallest element that was in the heap before the push-pop operation.

### Updated State:

- `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
- `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list, but now one of these elements has been replaced by `item` if `item` is smaller.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`.
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+1` elements.
- `current_profit` is updated based on the condition: if the sum of the negated price and the bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`.
- `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before the push-pop operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with one element possibly replaced by `item`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+1` elements, `current_profit` is updated based on the condition: if the sum of the negated price and the bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before the push-pop operation.**
