Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with one element possibly replaced by `item`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+3` elements, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `combined` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit -= item[1]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
