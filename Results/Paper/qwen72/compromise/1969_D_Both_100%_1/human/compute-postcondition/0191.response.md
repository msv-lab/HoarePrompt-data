Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated as follows: if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, or `None` if `removed_item` does not exist, and `combined` is now one tuple shorter. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**
