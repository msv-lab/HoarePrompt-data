Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (each element is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+1` elements, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. Additionally, the sum of the negated price and the bonus of `item` is less than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `current_profit` by adding the negated price (`item[0]`) of the last element (`item`) that was removed from `combined`.
- The value of `current_profit` is now `current_profit + item[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
