Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, but if `combined` was not empty, it is now missing its last `k` tuples, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it checks if `combined` is not empty.
- If `combined` is not empty, the last tuple (with the highest bonus value) is popped from `combined` and pushed into `heap`.
- After `k` iterations, `heap` will contain the last `k` tuples from `combined`, which are the tuples with the highest bonus values.
- The `combined` list will be missing these last `k` tuples.
- The variable `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so after `k` iterations, `k` will be 0.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
