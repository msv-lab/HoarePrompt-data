The code `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a new list called `combined` by pairing elements from the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list together. Each element in `combined` is a tuple consisting of one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.

Given the initial state:
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list.
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.

The `combined` list will contain tuples where each tuple consists of a negated price from `neg_prices` and the corresponding bonus from `bonuses`.

The rest of the variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and the corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**
