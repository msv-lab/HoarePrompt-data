The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop's ability to execute another iteration depends solely on the value of `test_cases`. Since the loop iterates over a range defined by `test_cases`, the loop will execute as long as there are remaining iterations left, which is controlled by the value of `test_cases`.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 (since it decrements by 1 each iteration). However, since the loop uses `range(test_cases)`, the actual decrement happens implicitly with each iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration (since one iteration has already completed).

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list with elements possibly replaced during the loop execution, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution.**
