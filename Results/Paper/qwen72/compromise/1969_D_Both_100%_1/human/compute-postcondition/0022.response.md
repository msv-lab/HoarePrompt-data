Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it pops the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined` and pushes it into `heap`.
- After `k` iterations, `heap` will contain the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`.
- The `combined` list will be missing these `k` tuples, as they have been removed and added to `heap`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
