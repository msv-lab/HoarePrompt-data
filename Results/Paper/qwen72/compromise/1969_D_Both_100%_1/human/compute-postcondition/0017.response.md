The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pushes the last element of the `combined` list onto the `heap`. Since `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, the last element is the one with the highest bonus value (because the list is sorted by bonuses in ascending order). This element is removed from `combined` and added to `heap`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. **`heap`**: Initially, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined`. After the operation, `heap` will contain the tuple that was previously the last element of `combined`.

2. **`combined`**: Initially, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, missing the tuple with the highest bonus value. After the operation, `combined` will be missing the tuple that was previously the last element (which had the highest bonus value).

3. **Other Variables**: The values of `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined` (previously the last element of `combined`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the tuple with the highest bonus value, and `k` must be greater than 0 and one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
