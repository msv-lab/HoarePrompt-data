The function `func_1()` is called and its return value is assigned to the variable `test_cases`. The initial state specifies that `test_cases` is a positive integer, which means the value returned by `func_1()` should also be a positive integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`, a positive integer; `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= n; `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items; `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the prices Bob pays for the items, and both `prices` and `bonuses` have the same length `n`.**
