Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `combined` is not empty and `removed_item` is not None, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, or `None` if `removed_item` does not exist. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is now `current_profit - item[1]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `current_profit` is now `current_profit + item[0]`, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.***
