To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `combined`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 1
- `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order)
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, but if `combined` was not empty, it is now missing its last `k` tuples
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0
- `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`
- `k` is 0

The key condition for the loop to execute is that `combined` must not be empty. Since `combined` is mentioned as being "missing its last `k` tuples" and `k` is 0, this implies that `combined` should still contain elements for the loop to execute.

However, the current state indicates that `k` is 0, which means no tuples were removed from `combined`. Therefore, `combined` should still contain elements unless it was initially empty.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `combined` is not empty. Since `k` is 0, no tuples were removed, so `combined` should still have elements if it was not empty initially.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `combined` is not empty. This can be stated as:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, and `k` is 0**
