The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples with similar structure. It calculates the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` and adds to it the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `primary_items` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this total sum. The `secondary_heap` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
