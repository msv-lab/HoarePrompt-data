Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`, and the size of `alphabet` is now `k-2` if `k-1` was not 1. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, the size of `alphabet` remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.***
