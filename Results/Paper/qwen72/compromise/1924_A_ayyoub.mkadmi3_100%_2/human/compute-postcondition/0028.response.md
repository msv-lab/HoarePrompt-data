Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` will contain all characters from `s` that were present in `alphabet` before being removed, and `s2` will contain all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had only one element left. The `alphabet` will be reset to its initial state (a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) if it ever became a single-element set during the loop. `r` is equal to the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**
