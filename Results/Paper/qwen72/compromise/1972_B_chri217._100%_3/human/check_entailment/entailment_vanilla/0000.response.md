### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, storing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins. This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for determining the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - The key observation is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that she will be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that he will be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The function `func_2` counts the number of facing-up coins using a generator expression and the `sum` function.
   - It then checks if the count of facing-up coins is odd (`ups % 2` is `1`) or even (`ups % 2` is `0`).
   - If the count is odd, it returns "YES" (Alice wins), otherwise it returns "NO" (Bob wins).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins correctly. If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses, which is consistent with the parity check.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin left correctly. If there is only one coin left and it is facing up, the player whose turn it is can remove it and win.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The problem states that both players play optimally. The parity check ensures that the optimal strategy is followed, as the player who can always force the game to end with an odd number of facing-up coins will win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all the edge cases and follows the optimal strategy as described in the problem.
