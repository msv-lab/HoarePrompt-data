The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads from the standard input to gather `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. The function returns a list `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`.
