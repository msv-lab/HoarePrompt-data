Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with all test cases processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case, `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, and `res` is the final computed value for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all iterations, the `test_cases` list has been fully processed, and the `results` list contains the final computed value of `res` for each test case. The variables `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `x`, `n`, and `res` reflect the state of the last test case processed by the loop. The `num_list` is the list of integers from the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is the total number of integers in `num_list`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `n` is the number of sticks in the last test case, and `res` is the final result of the computation for the last test case.
