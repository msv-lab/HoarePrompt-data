Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens` plus the value of the second key in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
