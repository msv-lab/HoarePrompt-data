The code `results.append(res)` adds the value of `res` to the list `results`. The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the input, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop. The `results` list now includes the value of `res`.**
