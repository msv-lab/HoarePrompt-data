Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- If `cnt` is less than 2, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` evaluates to 0, so `res` remains unchanged.
- If `cnt` is 2 or greater, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` is calculated and added to `res`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`) remain unchanged.
