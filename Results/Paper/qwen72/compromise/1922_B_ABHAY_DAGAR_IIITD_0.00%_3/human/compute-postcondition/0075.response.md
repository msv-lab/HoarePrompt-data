Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.***
