Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged and contains at least one test case.
- The `results` list remains empty.
- The `n` integer remains unchanged and represents the input integer.
- The `num_list` list remains unchanged and contains at least `n` integers.
- The `num_of_lens` dictionary remains unchanged and contains each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.
- The `res` variable is updated to the sum of two parts:
  - The first part is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count (i.e., `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for each `cnt` that is at least 3).
  - The second part is the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements (i.e., `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each `cnt` that is at least 2).
- The `total_count` variable is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
