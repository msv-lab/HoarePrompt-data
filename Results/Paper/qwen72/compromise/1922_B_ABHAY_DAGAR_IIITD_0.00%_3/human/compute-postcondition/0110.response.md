Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `x`, `n`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` is still the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and it is greater than or equal to 3.
