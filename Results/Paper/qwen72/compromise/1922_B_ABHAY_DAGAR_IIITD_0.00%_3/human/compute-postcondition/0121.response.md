Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`, so the new value of `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `x`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The value of `res` is updated based on the condition: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` becomes `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.
