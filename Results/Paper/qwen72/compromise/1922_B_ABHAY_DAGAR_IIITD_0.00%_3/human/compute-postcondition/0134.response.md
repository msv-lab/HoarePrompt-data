To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`test_cases`**: This is a list of test cases, and it is mentioned that all test cases have been processed.
2. **`results`**: This is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations. It is stated that `results` must have at least two elements.
3. **`num_list`**: This is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case.
4. **`num_of_lens`**: This is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`.
5. **`total_count`**: This is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case.
6. **`x`**: This is the last integer in the last `num_list`.
7. **`n`**: This is the input integer for the last test case.
8. **`res`**: This is the final computed value for the last test case.
9. **`result`**: This is the second element in the `results` list.

Given the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the second element in the `results` list. Since the exact values of the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the value of `result` in terms of the information given.

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the `results` list)**
