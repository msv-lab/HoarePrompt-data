Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it.
- `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`.
- `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`.
- The new value of `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The list `results` now contains the updated value of `res`.
