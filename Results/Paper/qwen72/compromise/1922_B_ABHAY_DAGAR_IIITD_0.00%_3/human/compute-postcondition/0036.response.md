The only objects in the loop head are the variable `cnt` and the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `cnt` must be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least two key-value pairs.
- `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `cnt` must be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `num_of_lens` must still have at least one more value to iterate over, meaning it must have at least two key-value pairs remaining (since one has already been processed).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`**.
