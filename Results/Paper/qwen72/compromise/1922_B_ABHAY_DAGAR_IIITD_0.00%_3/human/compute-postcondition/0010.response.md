Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes `x` as a key. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added as a key with a value of 1.***
