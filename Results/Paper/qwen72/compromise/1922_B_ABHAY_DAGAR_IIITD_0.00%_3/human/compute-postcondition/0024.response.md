The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the calculation `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The value of `cnt` is the count of a specific integer in `num_list`, and it is given that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. The calculation is a combination of multiplication and integer division, which will result in a non-negative integer since `cnt` is at least 3. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`) are not affected by this code.

Let's assume `cnt` is 3 for the minimum case:
- `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` = `3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6` = `3 * 2 * 1 // 6` = `6 // 6` = 1
- Therefore, `res` is updated to `res + 1`.

If `cnt` is greater than 3, the value added to `res` will be larger, but the exact value depends on the specific value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair, `res` is `res + (cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6)`, `total_count` is 0, and the count of the integer `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
