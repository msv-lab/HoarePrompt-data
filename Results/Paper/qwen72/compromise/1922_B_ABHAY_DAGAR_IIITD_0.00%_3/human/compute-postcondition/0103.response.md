Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 3 integers, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the third integer in the `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens` at the key `x` to 1. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. The initial state conditions for `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `total_count`, and `n` are still valid. The value of `x` is still the third integer in `num_list`, but now `num_of_lens[x]` is explicitly set to 1.
