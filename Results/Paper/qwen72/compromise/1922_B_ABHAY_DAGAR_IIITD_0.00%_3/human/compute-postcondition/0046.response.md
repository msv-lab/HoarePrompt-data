The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `num_list`.

- `num_list` is now a list of integers provided by the input.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`, `n`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from the previous `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in the previous `num_list`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, `n` is an input integer.**
