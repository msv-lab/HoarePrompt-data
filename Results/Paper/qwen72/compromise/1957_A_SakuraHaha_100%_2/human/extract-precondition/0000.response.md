Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.**

However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not match the problem description, as it should accept parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the integer `n` and the list of stick lengths.
