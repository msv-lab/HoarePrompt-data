The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `x` is an input integer minus 1, with the constraint that `x` must be greater than or equal to 7. Let's break down the condition:

1. **Current Condition**: `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`
2. **Substitute the current values**: `2 ** (3 + 1) <= x + 1` which simplifies to `16 <= x + 1`
3. **Solve for x**: `15 <= x`

Given that `x` must be greater than or equal to 7, and the current condition requires `x` to be at least 15, the loop can certainly execute one more time if `x` is at least 15.

Since `i` is 3, the next iteration will increment `i` to 4. We need to ensure that the loop condition still holds for `i = 4`:

1. **Next Condition**: `2 ** (4 + 1) <= x + 1`
2. **Simplify**: `32 <= x + 1`
3. **Solve for x**: `31 <= x`

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be at least 31.

Since the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `x`, and `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 31.

State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 31, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 4**
