Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `ansv`.
   - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1: This means `ansv` contains all integers starting from 0 up to `mx - 1`.
   - `ansv` has been fully printed: This indicates that all elements of `ansv` have already been printed before the given code snippet.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print()
   ```

The `print()` statement with no arguments prints a newline character. This is a common use of the `print()` function to move the cursor to the next line in the output.

Given the initial state, we know that the list `ansv` has already been printed in full. The `print()` statement will simply add a new line to the output.

Output: **(a new line is printed)**
