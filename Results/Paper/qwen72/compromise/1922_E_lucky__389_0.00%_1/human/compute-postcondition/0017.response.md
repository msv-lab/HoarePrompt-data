Output State: **`x` is an input integer minus 2^i, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2^i - 1, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i - 1 ≤ x, and `i` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting `2^i - 1` from it. Since `x` was initially an input integer minus 1, after the subtraction, `x` becomes the input integer minus `2^i`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
