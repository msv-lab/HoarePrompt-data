Output State: **`i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), and `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop continues to increment `i` until \(2^{(i+1)}\) is no longer less than or equal to `x + 1`. This means that after the loop has finished executing, `i` will be the largest integer for which \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `x`. In other words, `i` will be the highest power of 2 that fits within the range defined by `x + 1`. The value of `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and it must still be greater than or equal to \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\) for the loop to have executed all its iterations.
