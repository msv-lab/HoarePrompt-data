### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function starts by decrementing `X` by 1. This is because the problem considers the empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, and the goal is to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It initializes `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences and `mx` to track the maximum length.
   - The while loop continues until `x` becomes 0. Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and appends the corresponding exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts \(2^i - 1\) from `x` and updates `mx` to the maximum value found.
   - After the loop, `x` should be 0, indicating that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`.

3. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
   - The length of `ansv` is printed, followed by the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The length of `ansv` is at most 200 because the maximum value of `mx` is 60 (since \(2^{60} - 1\) is the largest power of 2 less than \(10^{18}\)).
   - The elements of `ansv` are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], which is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `X` is 2 correctly by printing a single element array.
   - The function should handle the case where `X` is 1, but the problem specifies \(2 \le X \le 10^{18}\), so this case is not relevant.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for the given range of `X`. The logic and output are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
