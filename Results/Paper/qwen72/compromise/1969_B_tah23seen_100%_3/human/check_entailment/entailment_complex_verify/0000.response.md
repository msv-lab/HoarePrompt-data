Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The function's logic is flawed because it only considers the cost of shifting '0's that follow '1's, but it does not account for the optimal way to cyclically shift the entire string to achieve the sorted order.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's (`one`).
   - When it encounters a '0' and there have been '1's before it, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
   - This logic is based on the assumption that each '0' following a '1' requires a shift of the entire segment of '1's plus the '0'.

3. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The function does not consider the optimal way to shift the entire string to achieve the sorted order.
   - It only increments the cost based on the number of '1's and '0's in a local segment, which can lead to overestimating the cost.

4. **Examples from the Original Assessment**:
   - For the input string `101011`:
     - Correct output: `5` (as described in the assessment).
     - Function output: `9` (as described in the assessment).
   - For the input string `01101001`:
     - Correct output: `11` (as described in the assessment).
     - Function output: `13` (as described in the assessment).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to shift the string such that all '1's are moved to the end of the string.
   - One efficient way to do this is to find the position of the first '0' after the last '1' and calculate the cost based on the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle all potential cases and overestimates the cost.
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the function's incorrectness.

Final: **False**
