It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The problem description and the code snippet suggest a function named `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, but the function definition you provided is `def func():` which does not match the problem description. I will provide the precondition based on the actual function described in the problem.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to generate Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders of the current directory, where the subfolder names are numeric and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with numeric names.**
