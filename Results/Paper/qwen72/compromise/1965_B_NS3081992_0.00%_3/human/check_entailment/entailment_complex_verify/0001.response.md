### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a combination of binary representation and specific sequence construction to ensure the conditions are met.
   - The function `func_14` is the main function responsible for constructing the sequence.

3. **Breaking Down `func_14`:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - `(n, k) = func_7()` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - **Special Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1`, the function handles it separately:
       - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
       - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed by the powers of 2.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - The function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of `k`'s binary representation to the length of `n`'s binary representation.
     - This ensures that all values up to `n` except `k` can be formed by the sequence.

4. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The sequence elements are non-negative integers, which is also within the allowed range.

5. **Evaluating the Annotated Code:**
   - **Special Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the sequence `[2]`, which is correct.
     - If `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the function returns a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - The function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of `k`'s binary representation to the length of `n`'s binary representation.
     - This ensures that all values up to `n` except `k` can be formed by the sequence.

6. **Testing the Solution:**
   - The solution should be tested with various values of `n` and `k` to ensure it meets the conditions.
   - For example:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct.
     - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct.
     - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct.
     - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` is correct.
     - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution appears to handle all the given constraints and test cases correctly.
   - The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values up to `n` can be formed.
