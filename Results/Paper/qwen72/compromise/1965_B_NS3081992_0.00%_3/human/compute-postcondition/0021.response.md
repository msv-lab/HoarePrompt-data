Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. If `k == 1`, then `n = 15`, `k = 1`, `b = '1111'`, `l = 4`, and `ans = [2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, and `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, followed by the value `k + 1`, the value `2 * k + 1`, and then powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).***
