To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`.
   - `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of the new `b`.
   - `k` is equal to 1.
   - `ans` is [2, 3].
   - `n` is not equal to 2.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`.
   - In each iteration, `2 ** i` is appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Determine the Final State:**
   - The loop will append `2 ** i` for each `i` from 2 to `l - 1`.
   - The final value of `ans` will be the initial list [2, 3] plus the values of `2 ** i` for each `i` from 2 to `l - 1`.

Let's assume `func_7()` returns some values for `n` and `k`. For the sake of this example, let's say `func_7()` returns `n = 15` and `k = 1` (since `k` is already 1, it doesn't change).

- `n = 15`
- `b = bin(15) = '1111'` (without the '0b' prefix, `b = '1111'`)
- `l = len('1111') = 4`

The loop will iterate from `i = 2` to `i = 3` (since `range(2, 4)` includes 2 and 3).

- For `i = 2`, `2 ** 2 = 4` is appended to `ans`.
- For `i = 3`, `2 ** 3 = 8` is appended to `ans`.

Thus, the final state of `ans` will be:
- `ans = [2, 3, 4, 8]`

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still 15.
- `k` is still 1.
- `b` is still '1111'.
- `l` is still 4.

Output State: **`n = 15`, `k = 1`, `b = '1111'`, `l = 4`, `ans = [2, 3, 4, 8]`.**
