You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

            #The program returns the string '1\n2'.
        #State: *`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the new `b`, and `k` is equal to 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2.

    #State: *`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. If `k == 1`, then `n = 15`, `k = 1`, `b = '1111'`, `l = 4`, and `ans = [2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`, and `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, followed by the value `k + 1`, the value `2 * k + 1`, and then powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers. If `k` was 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2))`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns a string. In Case_1, it returns the string '1\n2'. In Case_2, it returns a space-separated list of integers. If `k` is 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(lk-2)}\), followed by the value \(k - 1 - \sum(2^0 \text{ to } 2^{(lk-2)})\), then `k + 1`, followed by `2 * k + 1`, and finally, powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{(l-1)}\).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'.

Case_2: The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers. If `k` was 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2))`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
