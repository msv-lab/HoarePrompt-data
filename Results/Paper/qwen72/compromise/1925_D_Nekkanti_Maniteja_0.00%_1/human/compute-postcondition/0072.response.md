Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k - 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains the same as it was initially, within the range 1 to 50,000.
- **`i`**: The loop index `i` for the outer loop is now `k - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These values, which were provided by the user for the current test case, remain unchanged.
- **`M`**: The constant `M` is still 1,000,000,007, used for modular arithmetic.
- **`c`**: The variable `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, and it remains unchanged after all iterations.
- **`s`**: The variable `s` is updated to include the sum of the series `c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`. This represents the cumulative effect of the loop over all `k` iterations.
- **`a`**: The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over the `m` iterations of the inner loop, and it remains unchanged after all iterations.
- **`u`, `v`, `f`**: These variables are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration of the inner loop.
- **`m`**: The number of pairs of friends `m` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- **`k`**: The number of excursions `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, as the loop requires at least 3 iterations to execute.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations for the current test case.
