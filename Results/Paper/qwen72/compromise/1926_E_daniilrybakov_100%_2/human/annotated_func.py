#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and `k` values, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input, perform a series of calculations, and print the result of `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. The variables `s` and `m` will be reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the beginning of each iteration. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` will be undefined or reset for the next test case, but the number of test cases `t` will remain as specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of cards and `k` represents the position of the card to be determined, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function then performs a series of calculations to determine the final position of the card and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are reset or redefined in each iteration, and their final state is undefined after the function concludes.
