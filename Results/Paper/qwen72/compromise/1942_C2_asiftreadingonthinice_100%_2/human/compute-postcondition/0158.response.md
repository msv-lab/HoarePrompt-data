The code snippet `ans += y` adds the value of `y` to `ans`. The value of `y` is already defined in the initial state as being reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. The value of `ans` is updated by this addition.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2 + y` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2 + y`. `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. `x` and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed in the loop. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
