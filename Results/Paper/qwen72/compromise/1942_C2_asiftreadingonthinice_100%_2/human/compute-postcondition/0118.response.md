Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is now a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a[i - 1]` is the first element of the list `a`.
- The difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, so when divided by 2 using integer division, the result is an integer.
- `tmp` was initially an empty list, and now it contains this integer result.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
