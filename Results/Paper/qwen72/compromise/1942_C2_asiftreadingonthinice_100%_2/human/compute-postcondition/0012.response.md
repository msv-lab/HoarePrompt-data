The code snippet appends the result of the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number, the value appended to `tmp` will be half of this even difference.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `i` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.**
