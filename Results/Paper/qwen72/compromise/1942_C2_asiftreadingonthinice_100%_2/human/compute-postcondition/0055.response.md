Output State: **`ans` is increased by the value of `y`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The values of `ans`, `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
- The value of `ii` is still `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are reassigned the values from `input().split()`, where each value is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. Therefore, `n`, `x`, and `y` are now input integers.
