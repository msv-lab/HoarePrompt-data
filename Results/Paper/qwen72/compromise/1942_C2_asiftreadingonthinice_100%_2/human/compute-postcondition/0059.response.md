Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `tmp` as an empty list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
