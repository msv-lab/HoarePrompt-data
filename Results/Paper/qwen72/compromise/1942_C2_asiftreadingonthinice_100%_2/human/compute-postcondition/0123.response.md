Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements. `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is 2. `tmp` is a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number and not equal to 2, otherwise `tmp` is a list with one additional element.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- Given that `i` is 2, the code calculates the difference between the third element (`a[2]`) and the second element (`a[1]`) of the sorted list `a`.
- The result of `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.
- If `tmp` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element. If it already contained the integer result of `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` (as per the initial state), it now contains one additional element.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
