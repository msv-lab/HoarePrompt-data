Postcondition: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. The sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is equal to 2.**
