Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `tt` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers `a` representing chosen vertices. It then computes and prints the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices in `a` and up to `y` additional vertices. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `tt` test cases have been processed, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, and `y` is reset for each new test case. **
