Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `y` is equal to `y - (i - 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `i`.** 

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `i - 1` from its current value. The value of `i` remains the first element in the list `tmp`, and `ans` is still increased by `i`. The list `tmp` remains non-empty.
