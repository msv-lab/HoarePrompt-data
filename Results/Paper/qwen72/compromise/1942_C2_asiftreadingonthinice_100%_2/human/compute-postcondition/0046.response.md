The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` is a non-empty list, and `i` is the second element in `tmp`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `tmp`.

State: **`tmp` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`**
