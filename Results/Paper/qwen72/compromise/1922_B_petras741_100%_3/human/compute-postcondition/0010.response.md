Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1 and `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state specified that `q[w[0]]` was already incremented by 1, so `q[w[1]]` is now also incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `j`) remain unchanged.
