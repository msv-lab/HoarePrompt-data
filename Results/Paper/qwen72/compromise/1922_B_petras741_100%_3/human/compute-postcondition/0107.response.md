Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `q[w[j]]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state. The list `q` will have been updated such that for each index `w[j]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), the corresponding element in `q` will have been incremented by 1. This means that each element in the list `w` has contributed to incrementing the corresponding element in `q` by 1. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged.
