The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition `j < n` to hold true.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1 and `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 2**
