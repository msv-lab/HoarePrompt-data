The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the integer `0` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w`.

Output: **0**
