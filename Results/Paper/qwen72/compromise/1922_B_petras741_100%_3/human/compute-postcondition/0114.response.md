Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 0, `eta` is a list containing `[1, 1]` if `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing `[1]` if `q[1]` is not greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`.
- If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` initially contains `[1]`, so after appending `j`, `eta` becomes `[1, 1]`.
- If `q[1]` is not greater than 0, `eta` is initially an empty list, so after appending `j`, `eta` becomes `[1]`.
- The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
