Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- `res` is calculated using the formula `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- The value of `q[eta[0]]` is stored in `rho`, so `res` is effectively `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged.
