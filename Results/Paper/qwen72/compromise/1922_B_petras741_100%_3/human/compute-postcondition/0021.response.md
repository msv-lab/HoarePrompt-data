Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1. If `q[j]` > 0, `eta` is a list containing the integer `1`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
