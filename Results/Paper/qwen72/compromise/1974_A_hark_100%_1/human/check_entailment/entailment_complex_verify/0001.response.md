Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and called at the beginning of the program.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case. This is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. This is also correct.

3. **Case Handling:**
   - The program handles four cases, which is a good approach to cover all possible scenarios.

4. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.
   - The program then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and `bxsfory` screens are used to place the 2x2 icons.
   - After correcting this, the remaining 1x1 icons are calculated using `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.

5. **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
   - The program directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct.

6. **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
   - The program directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`. This is correct.

7. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
   - The program prints 0, indicating no screens are needed. This is correct.

8. **Mathematical Calculations:**
   - The use of `math.ceil` to round up the number of screens is correct and necessary for the problem.
   - The calculation for the remaining space for 1x1 icons in Case 1 is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4`.

9. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case, which is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is correct once the calculation in Case 1 is fixed.

10. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program correctly handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, or both are 0.

11. **Overall Logic:**
    - The overall logic is sound, but the specific calculation in Case 1 needs to be corrected.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the miscalculation in Case 1. The correct calculation should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` instead of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

Final: **False**
