Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and called at the beginning of the program.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case. This is correct.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. This is correct.

3. **Case Handling:**
   - The program handles four cases:
     - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can accommodate at most 2 2x2 icons (one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right).
       - It then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 15. The `+ y * 4` part is redundant and incorrect.
       - Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds it to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. This part is correct if the previous calculation is fixed.
     - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct.
     - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`. This is correct.
     - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed. This is correct.

4. **Mathematical Calculations:**
   - The program uses `math.ceil` to ensure that the number of screens is always rounded up to the nearest integer, which is correct for this problem since partial screens are not allowed.
   - The calculation for the remaining space for 1x1 icons is incorrect: `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be `x - bxsfory * 4`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case, which is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is correct if the previous calculation is fixed.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, or both are 0.

7. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is sound, but the specific calculation for the remaining 1x1 icons is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation in the first case.

Final: **False**
