Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and called at the beginning of the program.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Case Handling:**
   - The program handles four cases:
     - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
       - The remaining space is calculated by subtracting the space occupied by 2x2 icons from the total space and then adjusting for the 1x1 icons.
       - Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds it to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

4. **Mathematical Calculations:**
   - The program uses `math.ceil` to ensure that the number of screens is always rounded up to the nearest integer, which is correct for this problem since partial screens are not allowed.
   - The calculation for the remaining space for 1x1 icons is correct: `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This accounts for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and adjusts the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case, which is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, or both are 0.

7. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
