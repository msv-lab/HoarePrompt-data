The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index `a[0]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`. Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `i` is 3, it suggests that `a[0]` is likely 3 (assuming `a` is a list or tuple where `a[0]` is `i`). Therefore, the element at index 3 of `array` is appended to `answer`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` now contains the element at index 3 of `array`.**
