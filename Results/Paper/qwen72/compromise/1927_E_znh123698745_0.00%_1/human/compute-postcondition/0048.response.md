The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains an input positive integer greater than 2.
- `k` remains an input positive integer.
- `array` remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `i` remains 3.
- `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `a[-1]` or `a[0]` was used.

The specific change is:
- The last element of `a` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, and the last element of `a` is decremented by 1.**
