The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it is mentioned that `t` is a positive integer, which implies that `t` could be the input that determines the number of iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which aligns with the constraints of `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
