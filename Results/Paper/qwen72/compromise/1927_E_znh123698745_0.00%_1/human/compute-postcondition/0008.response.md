Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.** 

The value of `a[-1]` is decremented by 1, changing it from -1 to -2. All other variables remain unchanged.
