Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1.
4. `k` is an input positive integer.
5. `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1.
8. `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```

### Explanation:
- `answer` is a list that contains the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1. This means the list will look like:
  - If `n` is 3, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - If `n` is 4, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
  - If `n` is 5, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]`.

- The `print(*answer)` statement will unpack the list `answer` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- Let's say `n` is 5. Then `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]`.
- The `print(*answer)` statement will print: `1 3 5 2 4`.

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the list `answer` will start with 1 and alternate between odd and even numbers until all numbers from 1 to `n` are included.

### Final Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the list `answer` in the alternating pattern described, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 3 5 ... 2 4 (where the pattern alternates between odd and even numbers from 1 to n, and n is the input positive integer greater than 1)**
