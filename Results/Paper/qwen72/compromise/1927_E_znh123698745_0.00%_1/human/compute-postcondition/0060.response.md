The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. Given the initial state, `i` is currently set to `n-1`, which means it is not in the correct position for the loop to start. Additionally, `n` is already stated to be a positive integer greater than 1, so it does not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes correctly, `i` should be set to 1 before the loop starts. The other variables and objects in the initial state do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing only the integer 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**
