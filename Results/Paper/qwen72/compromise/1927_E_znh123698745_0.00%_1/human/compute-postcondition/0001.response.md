Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers.**

Explanation: The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. These two integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `int(input())` must be greater than 0, both `n` and `k` are positive integers.
