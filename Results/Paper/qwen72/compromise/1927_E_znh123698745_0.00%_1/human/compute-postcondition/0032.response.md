The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n-1`, which means it is not set to 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. The variable `n` is already greater than 1, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1**
