Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1. If `(-1) ** i` is -1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[1]`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.**
