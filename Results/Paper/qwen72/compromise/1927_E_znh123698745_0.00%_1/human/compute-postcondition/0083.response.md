The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a result for each test case based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` for each of `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
