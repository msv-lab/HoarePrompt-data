Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and `array[a[-1]]`, and `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -2 or the integers 2 and -1, depending on whether `(-1)` is in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -2 or the integers 2 and -1.
- If `a` contains 1 and -2, then `a[-1]` is -2, and `array[a[-1]]` is `array[-2]`, which is the second-to-last element of `array`.
- If `a` contains 2 and -1, then `a[-1]` is -1, and `array[a[-1]]` is `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`.
- `answer` initially contains the integers 1 and either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`.
- After the code execution, `answer` will contain the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and `array[a[-1]]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
