Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list that now includes the integer at the index `a[-1]` in `array`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` adds the integer at the index `a[-1]` from the `array` list to the `answer` list. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `answer` list is updated to include this new element.
