Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and the last element of `array`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.**
