The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be at least 2 for the condition `i < n + 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `dp` is a list with two elements: [1, 3]**
