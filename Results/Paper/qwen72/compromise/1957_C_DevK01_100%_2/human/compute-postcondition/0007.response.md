The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue, but since `i` is now 4, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `dp` is `[3, 7]`**
