### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You place a white rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at position \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves you have already made.

3. **State Update:**
   - For each move \((a, b)\), the program checks if \( a \neq b \).
   - If \( a \neq b \), it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) are occupied.
   - If \( a = b \), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because only \((a, a)\) is occupied.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp = [1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - The recurrence relation is \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \), which accounts for placing a rook in the current row and column, and the two possible ways to place the rook in the previous row and column.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the state based on the given moves.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` is correct for calculating the number of different final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
