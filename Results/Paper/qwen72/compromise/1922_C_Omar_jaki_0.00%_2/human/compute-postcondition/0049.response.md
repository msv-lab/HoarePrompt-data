Output State: **`a` must have at least 5 elements, `w` is the second element of `a`, `x` is the third element of `a`, `y` is the fourth element of `a`, `z` is the fifth element of `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v`**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is updated to `y - x`.
- The values of `a`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.
- The list `b` is extended by two new elements, where the first new element is `b[-2] + v`. The second new element is not specified, so it remains undefined in the output state.
