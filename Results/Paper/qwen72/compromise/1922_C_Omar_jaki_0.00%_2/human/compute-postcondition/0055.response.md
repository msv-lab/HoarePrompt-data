To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

### Initial State:
- `a` has its original length.
- `b` has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements.
- Each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows:
  - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
  - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`, `u`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Original Length of `a`**:
   - Let's denote the original length of `a` as `len_a`.

2. **Extension of `b`**:
   - `b` is extended by `2 * (len_a - 3)` elements.
   - This means `b` will have `len(b) + 2 * (len_a - 3)` elements after the extension.

3. **Calculation of New Elements**:
   - For each pair of new elements added to `b`, the conditions are:
     - First new element: `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
     - Second new element: `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.

4. **Final State of `b`**:
   - The final state of `b` will depend on the initial values of `b` and the values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`.
   - Since the exact values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the process of how `b` is extended.

### Output Description:
- The `print(b, 'B')` statement will print the list `b` after it has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements, followed by the string 'B'.
- The exact values of the new elements in `b` depend on the conditions described, but the general structure of `b` will be clear.

### Final Output:
Output: **[b with 2 * (len(a) - 3) additional elements calculated as described, 'B']**

This output indicates that the list `b` will be printed with the additional elements appended according to the specified rules, followed by the string 'B'.
