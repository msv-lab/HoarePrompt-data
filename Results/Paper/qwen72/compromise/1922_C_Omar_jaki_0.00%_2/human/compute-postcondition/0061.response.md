To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`a`**: Has its original length.
2. **`b`**: Has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements. Each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows:
   - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
   - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.
3. **`t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u`**: Remain unchanged.
4. **`u`**: Is now `u - 1` and must be a truthy value.
5. **`c` and `d`**: Are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`, and `c` is less than `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is initially some list.
   - It is extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements.
   - Each pair of new elements is calculated based on the conditions involving `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`.

2. **Indices in `b`**:
   - The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` refer to specific elements in the extended list `b`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are returned by the function `r()` and `c < d`, these indices will point to valid elements in the extended list `b`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` computes the difference between two specific elements in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the initial state and the specific conditions for extending `b`, the exact numerical values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` depend on the values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`, which are not explicitly provided. However, the print statement will output the difference between these two elements.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] and b[(c - 1) * 2] are elements in the extended list b based on the given conditions)**
