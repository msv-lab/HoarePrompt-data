To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
2. `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\).
4. `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
5. `queries` is a list of \(m\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\).
6. `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
7. `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 3.
8. `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b`**:
   - `b` is described as having the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
   - Let's denote these last two elements as `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.

2. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`.
   - Since `r()` is not explicitly defined, we assume it returns valid indices for the list `b`.

3. **Expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`**:
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are used to access elements in the list `b`.
   - These indices must be valid, meaning they should point to existing elements in `b`.

### Possible Values:
- Since `b` has the last two elements as cumulative sums, let's assume:
  - `b[-2] = S1` (cumulative sum of differences up to some point)
  - `b[-1] = S2` (cumulative sum of differences up to another point)

- If `c` and `d` are such that:
  - `c * 2 - 1` points to `b[-1]` (i.e., `S2`)
  - `d * 2 - 1` points to `b[-2]` (i.e., `S1`)

### Calculation:
- The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be:
  - `S2 - S1`

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the difference between the two cumulative sums.

Output: **S2 - S1 (where S2 and S1 are the last two elements of the list `b` representing cumulative sums of differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions)**
