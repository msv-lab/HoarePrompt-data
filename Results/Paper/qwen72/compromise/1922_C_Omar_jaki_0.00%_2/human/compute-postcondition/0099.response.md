To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
2. `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`.
3. `b` is updated to a list where each element is determined by a specific formula involving `v1`, `x1`, `w1`, `z1`, `y1`, `v2`, `x2`, `w2`, `z2`, `y2`, ..., `vn`, `xn`, `wn`, `zn`, `yn`.
4. `u` is the first value returned by the function `r()` minus 1 and must evaluate to `True`.
5. `c` is less than `d`.

### Understanding the List `b`:
The list `b` is constructed as follows:
- `b = [0, 0, v1, v1 if v1 > x1 - w1 else 1, 2*v1 if v1 > z1 - y1 else v1 + 1, v2 if v2 > x2 - w2 else 1, v2 + (v2 if v2 > z2 - y2 else 1), ..., vn if vn > xn - wn else 1, vn + (vn if vn > zn - yn else 1)]`

### Key Points:
- `b` starts with `[0, 0]`.
- Each subsequent pair of elements in `b` is determined by the conditions involving `v1`, `x1`, `w1`, `z1`, `y1`, etc.
- The indices used in the `print` statement are `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

### Evaluating the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Indices Calculation**:
   - `d - 1` gives the position of `d` in the sequence starting from 0.
   - `(d - 1) * 2` gives the index in the list `b` corresponding to the first element of the pair at position `d - 1`.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` gives the index in the list `b` corresponding to the first element of the pair at position `c - 1`.

2. **Values at Indices**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is the first element of the pair at position `d - 1`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is the first element of the pair at position `c - 1`.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between these two values.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `v1`, `x1`, `w1`, `z1`, `y1`, etc., are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the first elements of the pairs at positions `d - 1` and `c - 1` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] is the first element of the pair at position d - 1 and b[(c - 1) * 2] is the first element of the pair at position c - 1 in the list b)**
