The provided code defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function `r` is now ready to be used to read inputs in the form of space-separated integers.

The initial state variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries`) are not directly modified by this code snippet, but the function `r` is added to the environment, which can be used to read and process inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A function `r` is defined to map input to integers.**
