To solve this, let's break down the given code snippet and its effects:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `a` must have at least 5 elements.
   - `w` is the second element of `a`.
   - `x` is the third element of `a`.
   - `y` is the fourth element of `a`.
   - `z` is the fifth element of `a`.
   - `v` is `y - x`.
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet extends `b` with two more elements:
     - The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
     - The second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - **First New Element**: `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
     - `b[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `b` before the extension.
     - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `1`.
   - **Second New Element**: `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
     - `b[-1]` is the last element of `b` before the extension.
     - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `1`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `w` remains the second element of `a`.
   - `x` remains the third element of `a`.
   - `y` remains the fourth element of `a`.
   - `z` remains the fifth element of `a`.
   - `v` remains `y - x`.
   - `b` is extended by two new elements:
     - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
     - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.

Output State: **`a` must have at least 5 elements, `w` is the second element of `a`, `x` is the third element of `a`, `y` is the fourth element of `a`, `z` is the fifth element of `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.**
