The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `password` must have at least 1 character, and `char` should be the first character of `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of 1 to 20 characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `char` is the first character of `password`; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list**
