Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes each testcase by reading the length `n` and the password string from `data`.

2. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.

3. **Checking for Digits After Letters**: The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit appears after a letter. If a digit is found after a letter, it immediately returns 'NO'.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Output**: If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'. The results for all testcases are collected in the `results` list and printed at the end.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
