The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided is that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Since `t` is not a parameter of the function, it is likely used within the function body. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. Its behavior and return value are not specified based on the given information.**
