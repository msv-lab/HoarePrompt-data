Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. The key to solving this problem is understanding that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins. Here's why the solution works:

1. **Parity Analysis**: If the sum of the coins \(a + b\) is even, Bob will always win. This is because if the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty after an even number of moves, and since Bob plays second, he will be the one to make the last move, leaving Alice unable to play.

2. **Odd Sum**: If the sum of the coins \(a + b\) is odd, Alice will always win. This is because if the total number of coins is odd, the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty after an odd number of moves, and since Alice plays first, she will be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob unable to play.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins, and `func_2()` handles the input and output for multiple test cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
