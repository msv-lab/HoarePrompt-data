Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution, `func_1`, determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal play strategy described in the problem. The game involves players making decisions to swap wallets and remove coins, and the outcome depends on the number of coins each player has and the sequence of moves they make.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 1`:
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 1` and `b = 3`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 3`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is empty.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
  - Bob wins.

However, according to `func_1`, the sum of `a` and `b` is 4, which is even, so it would return "Bob". This is correct in this case, but let's consider another case:

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the case where `a = 4` and `b = 5`:
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 5` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice. After swapping, `a = 4` and `b = 4`.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 3`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 3` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 2` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice. After swapping, `a = 4` and `b = 2`.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 1`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is empty.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 3`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
  - Bob wins.

However, according to `func_1`, the sum of `a` and `b` is 9, which is odd, so it would return "Alice". This is incorrect because Bob can force a win by playing optimally.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases, and it is incorrect.
