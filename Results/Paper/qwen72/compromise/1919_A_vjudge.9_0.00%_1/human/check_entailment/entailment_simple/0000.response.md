Reasoning:  

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly solves the problem as described. The problem states that Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first, and each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The key insight to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins. Here's why:

1. **Initial Condition**: If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then the game will always end in a state where both wallets are empty at the same time, and the player whose turn it is will lose. Since Alice starts first, if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win.
2. **Odd Condition**: If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then the game will end with one player having 1 coin left while the other has 0 coins. Since Alice starts first, she can always force the game into a state where Bob is the one left with 1 coin, and thus Bob will be unable to make a valid move on his turn, making Alice the winner.

The function `func_1` checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`:
- If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
- If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, it returns 'Alice'.

This logic is correct based on the reasoning above. Therefore, `func_1` will always return the correct winner for any valid input.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading `a` and `b` for each test case, calling `func_1` to determine the winner, and storing the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given that both functions implement the correct logic and handle the input and output as required, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
