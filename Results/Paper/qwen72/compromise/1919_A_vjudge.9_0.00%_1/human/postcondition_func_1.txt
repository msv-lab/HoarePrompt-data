The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a number of test cases `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list, one by one. The function does not return any value.
