### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the frequencies of the two installations and the visibility duration of the fireworks.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`. This is intended to find the time at which the maximum number of fireworks could be visible.
   - The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and also ensures that `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. If this condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

3. **Logical Analysis:**
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is intended to handle a special case where the visibility duration `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
   - However, this condition is not necessary for the correct calculation of the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. The visibility of fireworks is determined by the overlap of their launch times and the duration `m`, not by the divisibility of `m` by `a` and `b`.

4. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct approach to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is to find the time at which the fireworks from both installations are most likely to overlap.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time `t` is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by the first installation and the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility window `m`.

5. **Simplified Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time `t` can be calculated as:
     - `max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b`
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes and ensures that we count the maximum number of overlaps correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. The special condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should be to use the simplified formula `max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b
        print(max_fireworks)
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks for each test case.
