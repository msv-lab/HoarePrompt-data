You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`, summing these differences. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes `t` test cases, and after processing all test cases, the value of `t` is reduced to zero. The initial list `a` mentioned in the annotations is not used or modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container should be `sum(a_i) / n`.
   - The operation allows us to transfer water from any container to any other container as long as the source container is to the left of the destination container.
   - If the sum of the amounts of water is evenly distributed, it is always possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by transferring water from containers with more water to containers with less water.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - It then sets `last` to the last element in `nums`.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0.
   - It iterates through each element `i` in `nums` and updates `curr` by adding `i - last`.
   - Finally, it checks if `curr` is 0 and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO".

4. **Identifying the Flaw**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the last element in `nums` should be used as a reference to determine if all elements are the same.
   - The correct approach should be to check if the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n` and if the target amount can be achieved by transferring water as described.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water in each container, which is `sum(nums) / n`.
   - Check if it is possible to transfer water from containers with more water to containers with less water to achieve this target amount.
   - This is always possible if the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n` and the target amount can be achieved by the described operations.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - It uses an incorrect reference (`last`) and does not check the target amount of water.
