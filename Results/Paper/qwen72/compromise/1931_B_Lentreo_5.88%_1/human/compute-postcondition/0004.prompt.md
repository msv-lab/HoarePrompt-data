You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The value of `t` is reduced by the number of iterations that have been completed, and `n` and `nums` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration. The variables `last` and `curr` are used within each iteration and reset at the start of each new iteration. The final output for each iteration is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `curr == 0`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result based on the constraints and relationships between these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
