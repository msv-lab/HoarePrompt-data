The code snippet `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, and if the first elements are equal, it sorts based on the second element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
