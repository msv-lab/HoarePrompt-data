Output State: **The function has executed, and for each test case, it has printed a value `s` which is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`. The number of test cases `n` has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until `n` reaches 0. The initial state of the list of test cases and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged. `n` is now an input integer.**
