Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 (since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 3`). The list `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates `(x, y)` that were input during the loop. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `res` remains 0, as it is not affected by the loop. The variables `x` and `y` are the integers that were input during the last iteration of the loop.
