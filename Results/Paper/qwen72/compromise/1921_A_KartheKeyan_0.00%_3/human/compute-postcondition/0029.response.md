Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` now contains two elements.**

The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, which already contains one tuple `(x, y)`. Therefore, `coord` now contains two identical tuples `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now has two elements.
