#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return or print the length of the array and the array itself if a valid array exists, or -1 if no such array can be found.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The function will print the number of operations (t) required to reduce X to 1 and the sequence of operations (ans) in reverse order. If the loop completes, the final value of X will be 1, and the array ans will contain the sequence of operations that were performed. The variables max and min will be updated based on the operations performed, but their final values depend on the specific input X.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, each containing a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates a sequence of operations to reduce `X` to 1. If a valid sequence is found, it prints the number of operations required and the sequence itself in reverse order. If no valid sequence can be found, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that the input has been consumed, and the output has been printed to the standard output.
