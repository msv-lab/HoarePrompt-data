Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, or report that no such array exists.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of \( X \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \( -10^8 \).
   - It creates an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce \( X \) to 1:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` and prints the length of the list and the list itself.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified.
   - The logic to reduce \( X \) to 1 by appending elements to `ans` is sound:
     - For even \( X \), appending a large value and dividing \( X \) by 2 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is halved.
     - For odd \( X \), appending a small value and subtracting 1 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by 1.
   - The function ensures that the elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - The function prints the length of the array and the array itself, which is the correct output format.
   - The function does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the operations performed, the length of the array will not exceed 200 for any valid \( X \) in the range \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly, which it does by appending a single element.
   - The function should handle large values of \( X \) correctly, which it does by efficiently reducing \( X \) using division and subtraction.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given constraints.
   - The function does not explicitly return -1 for invalid cases, but the problem statement does not require it to handle invalid inputs (since \( X \) is guaranteed to be in the range \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \)).

Correctness: **True**
