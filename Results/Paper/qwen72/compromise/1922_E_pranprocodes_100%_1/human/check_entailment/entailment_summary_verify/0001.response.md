### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one, and the elements appear in the same order as in the original array.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \(-10^8 \), which are the upper and lower bounds for the elements in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce \( X \) to 1, appending elements to `ans` based on whether \( X \) is even or odd:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` to maintain the correct order of elements.
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input/Output Format**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the integer \( X \) for each test case. It also prints the length of the array and the array itself in the required format.
   - **Array Construction**:
     - For even \( X \), appending a large value and dividing \( X \) by 2 is a valid operation. This is because appending a large value does not affect the number of increasing subsequences of the existing elements, and dividing \( X \) by 2 reduces the problem size.
     - For odd \( X \), appending a small value and subtracting 1 is also a valid operation. This is because appending a small value creates a new increasing subsequence of length 1, and subtracting 1 reduces the problem size.
   - **Array Length**: The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 by using a while loop that terminates when \( X \) becomes 1. Given the constraints and the halving mechanism, the array length will not exceed 200.
   - **Element Range**: The elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required, since `max` starts at \( 10^8 \) and `min` starts at \(-10^8 \), and they are decremented and incremented respectively.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **\( X = 1 \)**: The program implicitly handles \( X = 1 \) by the while loop condition. When \( X \) becomes 1, the loop terminates, and the program prints the length of the array and the array itself.
   - **Large \( X \)**: The program efficiently handles large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) by repeatedly halving \( X \) and reducing it by 1. This ensures that the array length remains manageable.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - **No Explicit Check for \( X = 1 \)**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is 1 at the start, but it implicitly does so by the while loop condition. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness.
   - **No Check for Array Length Exceeding 200**: The program does not explicitly check if the array length exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the halving mechanism, it is highly unlikely to exceed 200. This is another minor issue but does not affect the correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly constructs an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and handles the input and output format as required. The minor issues identified do not impact the overall correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
