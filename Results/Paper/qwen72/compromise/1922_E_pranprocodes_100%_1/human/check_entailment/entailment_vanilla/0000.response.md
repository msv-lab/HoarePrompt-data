### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one, and the elements appear in the same order as in the original array.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \(-10^8 \), which are the upper and lower bounds for the elements in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce \( X \) to 1, appending elements to `ans` based on whether \( X \) is even or odd:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` to maintain the correct order of elements.
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format for multiple test cases.
   - The logic for constructing the array is based on the properties of increasing subsequences:
     - For even \( X \), appending a large value and dividing \( X \) by 2 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is halved.
     - For odd \( X \), appending a small value and subtracting 1 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by 1.
   - The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 by using a while loop that terminates when \( X \) becomes 1.
   - The elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is 1 by printing the length of the array and the array itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly, which it does by printing the length of the array and the array itself.
   - The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently, which it does by repeatedly halving \( X \) and reducing it by 1.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is 1 at the start, but it implicitly does so by the while loop condition.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the halving mechanism, it is unlikely to exceed 200.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly constructs an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and handles the input and output format as required.

Correctness: **True**
