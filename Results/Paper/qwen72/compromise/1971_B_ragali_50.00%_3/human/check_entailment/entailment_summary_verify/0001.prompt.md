You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from user input. If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s`: either a rotated version (second half concatenated with the first half), a reversed version, or a modified version (second half concatenated with the first half again), depending on the conditions checked. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the strings `s` for each test case.
   - It uses `input().strip(' ')` to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input, which is a good practice to ensure the input is clean.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is used to determine if the string has more than one unique character, which is a valid approach to check if rearrangement is possible.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character (`len(a) > 1`), the program proceeds to rearrange the string.
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order: `newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`.
   - It then checks if the new string `newstr` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `newstr` is not different, it tries the reverse of the original string: `isreverse = s[::-1]`.
   - If the reverse is also not different, it tries another rearrangement: `print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the string can be rearranged, it prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
   - If the string cannot be rearranged (i.e., it has only one unique character), it prints "NO".

### Issues:
- **Redundant Rearrangement Check:**
  - The program checks if `newstr` is different from `s` and if `isreverse` is different from `s`. However, the third rearrangement `print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])` is redundant because it is the same as `newstr`.
  - This means the program will always print the same rearrangement twice if `newstr` is different from `s`.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program handles the case where the string has only one unique character correctly by printing "NO".
  - However, it does not handle the case where the string has more than one unique character but all possible rearrangements are equal to the original string. This is a rare case but should be considered for completeness.

### Correctness:
- The program is mostly correct in terms of logic and handling the main cases.
- However, the redundant rearrangement check and the potential edge case where all possible rearrangements are equal to the original string (though unlikely for strings of length at most 10) make the program slightly flawed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical redundancy and a potential edge case that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, it is not fully correct based on the problem description.
