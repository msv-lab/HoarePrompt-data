Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing spaces, and each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is not relevant, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the second half of `s` concatenated with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed version of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is checked: if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is not equal to `s`; if `isreverse` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, then `a` contains 1 or fewer unique characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `a` contains all unique characters from `s`, and `i` has iterated through each character in `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `isreverse` is a string that is the reverse of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, the program continues with these conditions. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is also equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1, no changes are made to `s`, `a`, or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `i` has iterated through each character in `s` and is now incremented by 1, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `len(a) > 1`, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If `len(a) <= 1`, the length of `a` is 1 or less.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
