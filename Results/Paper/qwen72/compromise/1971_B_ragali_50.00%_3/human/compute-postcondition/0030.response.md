The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `s` is not an empty string. The state of `t`, `a`, and the condition about the length of `a` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given that `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, for the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` must contain at least one character, `i` is the first character in `s`**
