Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list where each element is `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, `coef` is a list where each element is `1` if the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, otherwise `None`, `tot` is the total number of nodes visited during the last DFS call, `bipartite` is `True` if the last DFS call found the graph to be bipartite, otherwise `False`, `ok` is `True` and `tot` is not zero, indicating that at least one DFS call found the graph to be bipartite.**
