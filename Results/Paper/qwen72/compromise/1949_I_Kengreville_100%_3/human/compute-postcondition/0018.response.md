The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x`, `y`, and `r`, which are lists of integers of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9; `visited`, a list of booleans of length `n` initially all set to False; and `coef`, a list of integers of length `n` initially all set to None.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but given the context, it is likely that the function processes these inputs in some way and returns a result based on the operations performed on `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`.

Functionality: **The function operates on implicit parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n` with specific value constraints, `visited` is a list of booleans of length `n` initially all False, and `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` initially all None. The function's specific output is not provided, but it is expected to return a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
