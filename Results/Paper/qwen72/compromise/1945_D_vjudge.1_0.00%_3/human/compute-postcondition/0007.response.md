To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `n - k` is greater than 0. This means that `n` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000
- `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9
- `soma_b` is 0
- `pref` is 0

The only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

For the loop to execute, `n - k` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `k`. The variable `i` should start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop in Python.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
- `n` must be greater than `k`
- `i` is 0
- All other variables (`lista_A`, `lista_B`, `soma_b`, `pref`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0**
