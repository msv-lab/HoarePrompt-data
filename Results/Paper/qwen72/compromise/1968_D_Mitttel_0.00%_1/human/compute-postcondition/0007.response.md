Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, PB and PS are integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, p is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, a is a list of integers of length n with each element in the range 1 to 10^9, `bodya_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PB)`, `sasha_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PS)`, and `bodya_score` is equal to `sasha_score`**
