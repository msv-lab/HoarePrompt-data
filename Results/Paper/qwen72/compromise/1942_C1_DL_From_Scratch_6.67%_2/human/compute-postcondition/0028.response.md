The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `list0`.

- `list0` was initially described as a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- After executing the code, `list0` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `_`, `T`, `i`, and `count` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is an input integer, `_` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `x - 2`. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times consecutive integers (with a difference of 1) appear in `list0` minus the number of elements in `list0` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` is the number of times consecutive integers (with a difference of 1) appear in `list0` minus the number of elements in `list0`.**
