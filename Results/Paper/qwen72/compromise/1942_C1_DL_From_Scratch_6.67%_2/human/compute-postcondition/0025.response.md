To determine what will be printed by the `print(count + x - 2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\).
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - The second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.

2. **Calculation of `count`:**
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times consecutive integers (with a difference of 1) appear in `list0` minus the number of elements in `list0` plus 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is the number of times consecutive integers (with a difference of 1) appear in `list0` minus the number of elements in `list0`.

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to print is `count + x - 2`.

Let's analyze the expression step by step:

- **`x - 2`**: This is simply the value of `x` minus 2.
- **`count`**: 
  - If `num` is 1, `count` is calculated as the number of consecutive pairs in `list0` minus the length of `list0` plus 1.
  - If `num` is not 1, `count` is calculated as the number of consecutive pairs in `list0` minus the length of `list0`.

### Example Calculation:
Assume `list0` is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`:
- Number of consecutive pairs: 3 (pairs are (1, 2), (4, 5), (5, 6)).
- Length of `list0`: 5.

If `num` is 1:
- `count = 3 - 5 + 1 = -1`.

If `num` is not 1:
- `count = 3 - 5 = -2`.

### Final Expression:
- If `num` is 1:
  - `count + x - 2 = -1 + x - 2 = x - 3`.
- If `num` is not 1:
  - `count + x - 2 = -2 + x - 2 = x - 4`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the value of `num` and the specific values in `list0`. However, the general form of the output can be described as follows:

Output: **x - 3 (if num is 1) or x - 4 (if num is not 1)**

This is the most precise description based on the given initial state and the logic of the code.
