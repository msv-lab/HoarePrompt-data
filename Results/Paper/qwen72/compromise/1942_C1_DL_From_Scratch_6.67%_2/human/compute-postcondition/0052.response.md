The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `list0`. This impacts the value of `list0`, which was initially described as a sorted list of integers derived from the input. After executing the code, `list0` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `_`, `T`, `i`, `num`, and `count`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is an input integer, `_` is 3, `T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `list0` is a list of integers derived from the new input, and `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` (from index 0 to `x-2`) is exactly 1, plus 1 if `num` is 1.**
