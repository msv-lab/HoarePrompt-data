Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is an input integer, `_` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.***
