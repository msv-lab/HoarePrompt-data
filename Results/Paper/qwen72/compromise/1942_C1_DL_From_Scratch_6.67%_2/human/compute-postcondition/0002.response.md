The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9
- `x` is an integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)
- `y` is 0
- The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n
- `_` is 1
- `T` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an input integer, the second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `_` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0.**
