Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the variable `a` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged, but `a` now holds the new list of integers. The first element of this new list is assigned to `tmp`, and `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of this new list. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `cnt` are not affected by this code snippet.
