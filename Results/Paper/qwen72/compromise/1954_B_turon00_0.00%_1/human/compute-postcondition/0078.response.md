Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 if the first element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.
- Initially, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`, which is `0` since `n` is greater than 1.
- `cnt` is 1 if the first element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
- Therefore, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between `0` and `cnt`, which is `0` if `cnt` is 0, or `0` if `cnt` is 1.
- Since `0` is always less than or equal to `cnt`, `ans` remains `0` regardless of the value of `cnt`.
