Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `a`. Since `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is now equal to `a[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `aa`, `i`, `ans`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
