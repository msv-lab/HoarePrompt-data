The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `_`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0**
