You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

If `k` is not 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. If the loop breaks, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` (the number of elements remaining in the list after the break), and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`. If the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions, and `r` is the last element of the list `a`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes, and `k` is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, and for each type `i`, we have `a_i` cards.
   - We can buy up to `k` new cards, and we need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that each type of card appears at least once in each subarray of length `n` to form a permutation.
   - We need to balance the number of cards of each type to achieve this.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Sort the Array:** The program starts by sorting the array `a` which contains the counts of each type of card.
   - **Distribute Coins:** The program then iterates through the sorted array to distribute the coins (new cards) in a way that minimizes the difference between the counts of different types of cards.
   - **Break Condition:** If at any point, the number of coins required to make the next type of card equal to the current type exceeds the available coins, the program breaks and calculates the score.
   - **Final Calculation:** If the loop completes without breaking, the program calculates the final score based on the remaining coins.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count of cards (i.e., `a[0]`).
     - `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0.
   - **Iterate and Distribute Coins:**
     - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-2`, the program checks if the number of coins required to make `a[i+1]` equal to `a[i]` for all previous types is greater than the available coins.
     - If it is, the program calculates the new value of `r` and the remaining coins (`rem`), and sets `y` to the number of types that are still not balanced.
     - If it is not, the program subtracts the required coins from `k` and updates `r` to `a[i+1]`.
   - **Final Score Calculation:**
     - If `k` is not zero after the loop, the program calculates the final score by adding the remaining coins to the balanced count.
     - If `k` is zero, the program calculates the score based on the balanced count and the remaining types.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the distribution of coins to balance the counts of different types of cards.
   - The final score calculation is done correctly by considering the balanced count and the remaining coins.
   - The program also handles the case where the loop completes without breaking, which means all types can be balanced using the available coins.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that the counts of different types of cards are balanced and then calculating the maximum score. The logic and steps are sound and align with the problem requirements.
