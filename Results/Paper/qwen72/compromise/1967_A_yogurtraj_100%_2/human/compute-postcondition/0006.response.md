Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code snippet `y = 0` initializes the variable `y` to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
