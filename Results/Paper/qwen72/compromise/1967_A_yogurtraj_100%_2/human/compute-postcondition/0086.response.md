The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the range for the loop. The loop can execute again if `ii` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1, and the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop, and `rem` is the remainder of `k` when the loop broke or 0 if the loop completed without breaking. If `k` is not 0, `r` is the value of `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]` at the last iteration where the loop did not break.**
