Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `y` is `n - 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 0, `y` becomes `n - 1`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `ii`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `rem`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
