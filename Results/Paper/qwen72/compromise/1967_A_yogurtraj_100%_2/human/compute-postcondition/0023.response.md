Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k % 2` which is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2` which is `a[1]`, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
