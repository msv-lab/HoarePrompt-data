The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. This changes the values of `n` and `k` from their initial states. The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `rem`, `a`, and `r`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
