Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k % 3`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `y` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` remains 0.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `rem` remains `k % 3`.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `r` remains `a[2] + k // 3`.
- `k` remains `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- `y` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - i`. Since `i` is 2, `y` becomes `n - 3`.
