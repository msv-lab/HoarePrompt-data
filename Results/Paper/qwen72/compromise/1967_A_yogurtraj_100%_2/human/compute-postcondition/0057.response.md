Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `y` is 0, and ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is less than or equal to `k`.**
