Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[0]`, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)` is true.**
