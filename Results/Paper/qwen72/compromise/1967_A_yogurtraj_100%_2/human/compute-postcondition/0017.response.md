Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `r` is the first element of the list `a`. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0 and `y` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (1 * (a[1] - a[0]))` and `r` is updated to the second element of the list `a`.***
