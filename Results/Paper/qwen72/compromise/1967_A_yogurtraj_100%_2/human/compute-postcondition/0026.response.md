Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `r` is the second element of the list `a`. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.***
