Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k % 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0])` depending on the condition, `y` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 - 1`, which is `n - 2`.
- The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `rem`, `a`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.
