Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square. The function then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` contain the coordinates, x-coordinates, and side length of the last square processed, respectively. The function does not return any value. **
