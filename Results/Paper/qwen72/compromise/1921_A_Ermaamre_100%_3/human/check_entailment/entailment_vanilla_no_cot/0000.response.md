Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four lines of input, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it extracts the x-coordinates of the four points and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates is equal to the difference in y-coordinates.

4. **Area Calculation**: It then computes the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`) and prints the result.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach is correct and will produce the correct area for each test case.
