The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of a grid, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which is not specified in the provided output. However, based on the input parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes the grid in some way, possibly to determine a specific pattern or property of the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each, though the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
