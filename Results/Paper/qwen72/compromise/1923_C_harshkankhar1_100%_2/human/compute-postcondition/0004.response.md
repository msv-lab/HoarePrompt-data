Output State: **The list `b` will contain cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` (excluding the first element, which is 0) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
