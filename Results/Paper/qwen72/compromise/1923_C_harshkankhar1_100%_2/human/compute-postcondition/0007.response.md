Output State: **The list `a` will contain cumulative sums of its original values, and the list `b` will still contain cumulative sums where each element (excluding the first element, which is 0) is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in the new `a` (after cumulative sum) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the original `a` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the differences between the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` for each query, and the final state of `a` and `b` will be the same as their state after the cumulative sums and adjustments are applied.**
