The code snippet `a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `a` that starts with 0 followed by these integers.

Output State: **The number of test cases `t` remains between 1 and 10^4. For the current test case, `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries, both of which are integers provided by the user and are within the range 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5. The elements of the array `c` and the queries are yet to be defined. `a` is a list of integers starting with 0, followed by the integers provided by the user.**
