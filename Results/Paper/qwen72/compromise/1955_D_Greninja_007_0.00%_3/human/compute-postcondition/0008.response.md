Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n and 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b_freq` is a dictionary-like object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a dictionary-like object that contains the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of the list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for all integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.***
