### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in array `b` and the initial window of size `m` in array `a`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the frequency in either array.
   - This is done correctly by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the first window to the last possible window of size `m`.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k` and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if true.
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window and the element that is sliding into the window.
     - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly:
       - Decreases the `matches` count if the element sliding out was in `b` and was part of the current matches.
       - Increases the `matches` count if the element sliding in is in `b` and can be part of the current matches.
   - The sliding window logic is correctly implemented, ensuring that the frequency and matches are updated efficiently.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if true.
   - This ensures that the last possible subarray of length `m` is also considered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State:**
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`.
  - `b` is a list of `m` integers where `1 <= m <= n` and `1 <= b_i <= 10^6`.
  - `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= m`.
  - `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
  - These conditions are correctly handled by the input reading and initial setup.

- **Frequency Counting:**
  - `b_freq` is a dictionary-like object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `b`.
  - `window_freq` is a dictionary-like object that contains the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of the list `a`.
  - The initial `matches` count is calculated correctly by summing the minimum frequencies of common elements in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1`, which is correct for sliding through all possible windows of size `m`.
  - The `matches` count is updated correctly:
    - When an element slides out, it is removed from `window_freq` and the `matches` count is adjusted if the element was in `b`.
    - When an element slides in, it is added to `window_freq` and the `matches` count is adjusted if the element is in `b`.
  - The `good_subarrays` counter is incremented correctly whenever `matches` is at least `k`.

- **Final Check:**
  - The program checks the last window after the loop and increments `good_subarrays` if `matches` is at least `k`.
  - This ensures that the last possible subarray is considered.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem description. The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly updates the frequency and matches count. The final check ensures that the last window is also considered.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
