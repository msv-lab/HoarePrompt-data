### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `good_subarrays` to 0, which will keep track of the number of good subarrays.
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to create frequency dictionaries for `b` (`b_freq`) and the first window of `a` (`window_freq`).

2. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The initial number of matches between the first window of `a` and `b` is calculated using the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` and update the number of matches for each new window.
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `n - m - 1`:
     - If the current number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `good_subarrays`.
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) and the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
     - It correctly updates the `matches` count by subtracting the contribution of the element sliding out and adding the contribution of the element sliding in.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check to see if the last window has at least `k` matches and increments `good_subarrays` if it does.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the count of good subarrays for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays. It handles the initialization, sliding, and final checks appropriately. The logic for updating the frequency counts and the number of matches is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
