You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`, and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the input integer `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given string, and calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds. The logic ensures that for each difficulty level, if there are not enough problems, the necessary number of additional problems is added to the total count. This approach covers all edge cases, including when there are no problems of a certain difficulty level or when there are fewer problems than required for the rounds. Therefore, the program is correct.
