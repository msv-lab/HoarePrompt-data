The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected that the function will process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function will handle `t` test cases, with `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input values `n`, `m`, and `a`.
