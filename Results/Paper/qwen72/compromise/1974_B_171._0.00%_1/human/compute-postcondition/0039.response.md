Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` is a list containing the characters 'a' and `char`, and `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`. In all cases, if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, the loop terminates after the first iteration.***
