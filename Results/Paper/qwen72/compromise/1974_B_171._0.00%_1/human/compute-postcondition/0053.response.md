Output State: **`c` is 99, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The value of `c` remains 99, and the `mapping` dictionary does not change because the `break` statement does not affect the values of variables. The program simply exits the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
