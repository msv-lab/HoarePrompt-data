Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
