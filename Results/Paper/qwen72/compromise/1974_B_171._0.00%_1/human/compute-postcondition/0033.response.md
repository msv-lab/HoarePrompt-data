The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` starts at 97 (ord('a')) and goes up to 122 (ord('z')). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98 (ord('b')). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 99 (ord('c')).

The other variables and objects (`encoded`, `char`, `mapping`, `decoded`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `c` is 99 (ord('c')). If `chr(c)` ('c') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now contains the entry `{'b': char}`, and `chr(c)` ('c') is in `mapping.values()`.**
