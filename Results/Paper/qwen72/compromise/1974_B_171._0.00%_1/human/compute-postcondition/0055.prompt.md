Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least three characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` is a list containing the characters 'a' and `char`, and `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`. In all cases, if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, the loop terminates after the first iteration.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`c` is 97. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, the character 'a' is added to the `mapping` dictionary with the key 'a', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `c` and `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`c` is 98, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged except possibly for a new key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the new key-value pair is added, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`c` is 99, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged except possibly for a new key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is `chr(98)`. If `chr(98)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the new key-value pair is added, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
