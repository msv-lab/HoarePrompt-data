Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the characters 'a' and `char` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. The loop has executed, and `c` is 97 (ord('a')). `chr(97)` ('a') is in `mapping.values()`, and the loop terminates after the first iteration.**
