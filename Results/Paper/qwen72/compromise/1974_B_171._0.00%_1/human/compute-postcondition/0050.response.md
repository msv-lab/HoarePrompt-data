Postcondition: ***`c` is 98, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged except possibly for a new key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the new key-value pair is added, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.***
