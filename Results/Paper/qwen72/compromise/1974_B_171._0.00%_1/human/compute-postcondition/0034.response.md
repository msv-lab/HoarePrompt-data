Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` contains the entries `{'a': char, 'b': char, 'c': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `c` is 99 (ord('c')). `chr(c)` ('c') is in `mapping.values()`.**

Explanation:
- `encoded` remains unchanged.
- `char` remains the second character in `encoded`.
- `mapping` now contains the entry `{'c': char}` in addition to the existing entries `{'a': char, 'b': char}`.
- `decoded` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains 99 (ord('c')).
- `chr(c)` ('c') is now in `mapping.values()`.
