### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The formula `t = b * 2` is used to determine the total number of 2x2 icons, which is then divided by 5 to find the number of screens needed. This is incorrect because it should be `t = b * 4` to account for the 4 cells each 2x2 icon occupies.
   - The correct formula should be `t = (b * 4) // 15 + ((b * 4) % 15 > 0)` to ensure that any remaining cells that do not fill a complete screen are accounted for.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done using `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This calculation is correct if `t` is correctly calculated. However, due to the initial error, `t` is often incorrect, leading to incorrect values for `t1`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the 1x1 icons. This is done using `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The formula `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)` is used to determine the additional screens needed. This formula is correct and ensures that any remaining icons that do not fill a complete screen are accounted for.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = (b * 4) // 15 + ((b * 4) % 15 > 0)
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)
        print(t)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons. The formula `t = b * 2` should be `t = (b * 4) // 15 + ((b * 4) % 15 > 0)`.
- After correcting this error, the program should work correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (due to the logical error in the initial calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons).
