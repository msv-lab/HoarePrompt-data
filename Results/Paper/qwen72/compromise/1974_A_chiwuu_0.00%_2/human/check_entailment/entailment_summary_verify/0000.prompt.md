You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to determine a value `t`, and prints `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are processed independently in each iteration, and the function does not affect any external variables or parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are only 1x1 icons (i.e., `b = 0`). For example, if the input is `1 0` (one 1x1 icon and no 2x2 icons), the program will output `1`, which is correct. However, if the input is `15 0` (fifteen 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons), the program will output `5`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit into a single screen (5x3 grid).

The issue arises because the program initializes `t` based on the number of 2x2 icons (`b`), and then checks if the remaining space can fit the 1x1 icons (`a`). If there are no 2x2 icons, the initial value of `t` is `0`, and the calculation for `t1` (remaining space) is incorrect. This leads to an incorrect final value for `t`.
