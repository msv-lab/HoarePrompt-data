Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - The function iterates over each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found after the loop, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic is correct because if there is at least one index where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` with an uppercase letter at that position, ensuring that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - This function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as described.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining if a template exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
