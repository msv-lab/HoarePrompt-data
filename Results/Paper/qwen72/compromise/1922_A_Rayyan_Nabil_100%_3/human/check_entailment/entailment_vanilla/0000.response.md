### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - The strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
     - The string `c` does not match the template `t`.
   - The template `t` is a string of length `n` where:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
     - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - It checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
     - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
     - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The logic in `func_1` is correct for the given problem. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]` at any position `i`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase version of a character that is different from `a[i]` and `b[i]` but matches the condition that `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
     - This ensures that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the inputs and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - It stores the results and prints them after processing all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - It also handles the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different at some position, which is correctly identified as a 'YES' case.
   - The program correctly identifies cases where `a` and `b` are the same as `c` at all positions, which is a 'NO' case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
