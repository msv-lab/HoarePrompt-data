The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (n, a, b, c, and results) are not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted)**
