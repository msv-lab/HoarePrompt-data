You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing t elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The list `results` remains unchanged, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged. The loop iterates through each element in `results` and prints it, but does not modify any of the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` containing only lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
