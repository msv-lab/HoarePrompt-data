Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, where `r` is `n - 1` and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
