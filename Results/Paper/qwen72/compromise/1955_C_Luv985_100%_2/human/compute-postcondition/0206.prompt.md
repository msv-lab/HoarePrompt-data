Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l, r <= n - 1, `ans` is an integer such that 0 <= ans <= n, and the loop has terminated. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. Otherwise, `l` and `r` are not equal, and `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where some elements may have been decremented, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `ans` is an integer that represents the number of elements in `a` that have been set to 0 during the loop execution, and the loop has terminated. If `l` is equal to `r`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= n, `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `ans` is an integer such that 0 <= ans <= n. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
