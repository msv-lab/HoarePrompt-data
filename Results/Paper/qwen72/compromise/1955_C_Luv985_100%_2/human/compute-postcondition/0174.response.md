The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was 0, so after the execution, `ans` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer and has been decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**
