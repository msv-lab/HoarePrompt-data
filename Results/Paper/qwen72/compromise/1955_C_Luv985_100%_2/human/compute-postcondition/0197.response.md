Output State: **`t` is the result of `k % 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.** 

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
