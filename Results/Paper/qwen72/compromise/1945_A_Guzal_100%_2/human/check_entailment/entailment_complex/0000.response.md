Reasoning:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents required for introverts is simply `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people. Since each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, the number of tents required for extroverts can be calculated by dividing the number of extroverts by 3 and rounding up. However, if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to complete the last tent, and the function should output `-1`.

3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in the tents after accommodating introverts and extroverts. The remaining spots are calculated by `(b + c) % 3`, and if this is not zero, an additional tent is needed to accommodate the remaining people.

4. **Calculation of Tents (k)**:
   - `k += a`: This adds the number of tents required for introverts.
   - `k += (b + c) // 3`: This adds the number of tents required for extroverts and the universals that can be used to fill the remaining spots in these tents.
   - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`: This accounts for any remaining people that need an additional tent.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, the function correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts as per their preference.
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, the function correctly calculates the number of tents needed.
   - If `b % 3 != 0` but `b % 3 + c >= 3`, the function correctly uses the universals to fill the remaining spots.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either the minimum number of tents or `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
