### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin, and vice versa), and the game will end when both wallets are empty, with Bob making the last move.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always make the first move to create an even difference, and then Bob will be forced to mirror Alice's moves, leading to Alice making the last move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
   - It then reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b` (where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`) from the input.
   - For each pair, the function checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the function prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference is odd, the function prints 'Alice'.
   - After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified and are not accessible outside the function.

5. **Validation of Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets.
   - The program's logic is consistent with this insight: it checks the parity of the difference and prints the winner accordingly.
   - The function summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the correct output for each case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and it handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

Final: **True**
