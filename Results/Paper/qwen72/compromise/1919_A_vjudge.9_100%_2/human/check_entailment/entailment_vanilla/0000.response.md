### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin, and vice versa), and the game will end when both wallets are empty, with Bob making the last move.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always make the first move to create an even difference, and then Bob will be forced to mirror Alice's moves, leading to Alice making the last move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the key insight described above.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
