Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding `m` cubes, one by one, in `n` moves. This is correct.
2. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have. This is correct.
3. If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build the tower. This is because you can always achieve a tower of `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs (if both are even) or by adding and removing cubes in a way that the difference between `n` and `m` is even (if both are odd). This is correct.
4. If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to build the tower because the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will always match the parity of the number of moves. This is correct.

The program correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the example. The execution summary also confirms that the program reads the input as expected and processes each test case correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
