Output State: **The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys that had `None` values, and the remaining keys still have their last unmatched ranks. The `trumps` list is now sorted in ascending order. The `answers` list contains the formatted strings for each non-`None` rank in the `suits` dictionary, paired with the ranks from the `trumps` list. If the `trumps` list runs out of elements before all non-`None` ranks are processed, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns.**
