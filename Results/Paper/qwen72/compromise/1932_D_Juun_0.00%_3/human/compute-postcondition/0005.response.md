The only object in the loop head is `card`, and the loop iterates over the result of `input().split()`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a string that, when split, results in a list of at least one element. This means the input string must contain at least one card.

State: **`card` is the first card from the input, the input string must contain at least one card**
