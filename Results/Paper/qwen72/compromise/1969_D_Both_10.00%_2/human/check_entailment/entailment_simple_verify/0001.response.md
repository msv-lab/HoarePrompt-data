### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case using `func_1` and `func_2`. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes an array `arr` to store the item prices for Alice and Bob as tuples.
   - It then sorts `arr` based on Bob's prices in ascending order. This is incorrect because the optimal strategy involves sorting based on the profit `b_i - a_i` in descending order to maximize Alice's profit.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program uses a min-heap `k_arr` to keep track of the `k` items with the highest profit for Bob.
   - It iterates over the sorted `arr` and pushes the items into the heap, ensuring that the heap always contains the `k` items with the highest profit for Bob.
   - The program then calculates the profit for Alice by summing the profits of the items in `k_arr` and the remaining items in `arr` where the profit is non-negative.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program should sort the items based on `b_i - a_i` in descending order to ensure that Alice maximizes her profit.
   - Bob will take the `k` items with the highest profit for free, and Alice will sell the remaining items to Bob.
   - The program does not correctly implement this sorting and profit calculation logic.

5. **Implementation Issues:**
   - The sorting of `arr` is based on Bob's prices (`b_i`) in ascending order, which is incorrect. It should be based on the profit `b_i - a_i` in descending order.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob takes the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
   - The logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the items Bob takes for free and the items Alice sells to Bob.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation, particularly the incorrect sorting and profit calculation logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
