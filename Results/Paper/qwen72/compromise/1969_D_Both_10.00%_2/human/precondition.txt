The function `inp()` is intended to read input data, but the specific input format and validation are not provided in the function definition. Typically, it would read multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, followed by two lists of n integers each for a_i and b_i, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
