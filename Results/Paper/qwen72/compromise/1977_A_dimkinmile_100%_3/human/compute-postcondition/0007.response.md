Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where both integers are within the range 1 to 100. It then checks if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` retain the values read from the input, and the program state reflects the result of the condition check as either 'Yes' or 'No' being printed. **
