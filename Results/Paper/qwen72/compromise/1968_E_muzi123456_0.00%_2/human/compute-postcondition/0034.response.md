The code snippet provided is:
```
print(i)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.

Since the value of `i` is explicitly given as 1, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
