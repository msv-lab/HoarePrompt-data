The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`**
