Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 3, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
