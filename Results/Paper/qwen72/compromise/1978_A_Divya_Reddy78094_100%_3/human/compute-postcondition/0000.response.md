Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of pages in each book for a test case. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `t` is now an input integer.**
