The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `books`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with a constraint of 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each inner list in `books` contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of pages in each book for a test case. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result is an integer that represents the number of books with an odd number of pages in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `books`. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of books with an odd number of pages in the corresponding test case.**
