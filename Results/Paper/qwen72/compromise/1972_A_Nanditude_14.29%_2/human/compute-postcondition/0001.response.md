Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9. However, the provided function definition `def func_1(arr):` does not match the intended parameters and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code. The intended functionality is not reflected in the provided code snippet.**
