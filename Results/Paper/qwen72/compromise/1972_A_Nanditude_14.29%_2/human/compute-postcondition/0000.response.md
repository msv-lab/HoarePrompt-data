Output State: **The program returns a sorted list in descending order. Since the variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state, and the function `min_new_problems` is expected to take two lists `a` and `b` as arguments, the provided code snippet does not use these inputs and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code.**
