#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_new_problems(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list in descending order. Since the variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state, and the function `min_new_problems` is expected to take two lists `a` and `b` as arguments, the provided code snippet does not use these inputs and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single list `arr` as a parameter and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order. The function does not use the parameters `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations, and it will result in an error if `arr` is not defined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list, sorted in descending order, is returned, and the original list `arr` remains unchanged.
