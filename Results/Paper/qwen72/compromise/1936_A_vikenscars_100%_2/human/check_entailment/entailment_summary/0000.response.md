### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized.
   - We can make at most `3n` queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.
   - Each query returns one of three possible results: `<`, `>`, or `=`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and follows the problem's interaction rules.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - **First Loop:**
     - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
     - For each `i`, it compares `(p_max_item_idx | p_max_item_idx)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
     - This loop effectively finds the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation `p`, as `(p_i | p_i) = p_i` for any `i`.
   - **Second Loop:**
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - For each `i`, it compares `(p_max_item_idx | p_pair_idx)` with `(p_max_item_idx | p_i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it further compares `(p_pair_idx | p_pair_idx)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
     - If the result of this second comparison is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - This loop aims to find the index `i` such that the XOR of `p_max_item_idx` and `p_i` is maximized.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the index of the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, produces the maximum possible XOR value.
   - The number of queries made is `n-1` in the first loop and `n` in the second loop, totaling `2n-1` queries, which is within the allowed `3n` queries.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the required format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It uses the allowed number of queries and correctly identifies the indices that maximize the XOR value.

**Correctness: **True****
