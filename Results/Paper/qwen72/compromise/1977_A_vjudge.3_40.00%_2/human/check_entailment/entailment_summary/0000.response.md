### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check (`n == m`)**:
   - If the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply place one cube on top of the tower in each move. This is a valid scenario, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

2. **Check if `m > n`**:
   - If the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes because he can only perform `n` moves. This is correctly handled by the program, which prints 'No'.

3. **Check if `m == n - 1`**:
   - If the desired number of cubes `m` is exactly one less than the number of moves `n`, Nikita can place one cube in each of the first `m` moves and then remove one cube in the last move. This is a valid scenario, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

4. **Check if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd**:
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, or both are odd, it is possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because:
     - If `n` and `m` are both even, Nikita can place cubes in pairs (e.g., place 2 cubes, remove 2 cubes, etc.) to achieve the desired number of cubes.
     - If `n` and `m` are both odd, Nikita can place cubes in pairs and then place one additional cube to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by printing 'Yes'.

5. **All Other Cases**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program correctly prints 'No' in these cases.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and scenarios based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
