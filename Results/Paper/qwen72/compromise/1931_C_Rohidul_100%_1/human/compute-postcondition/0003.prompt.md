You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The function should be designed to handle these inputs and compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The total number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        le = len(a)
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 1, 1
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal has been printed. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are reset and recalculated for each test case, and their final values after the last test case are not relevant to the output state. The loop variable `_` has completed its range, and the input has been fully consumed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
