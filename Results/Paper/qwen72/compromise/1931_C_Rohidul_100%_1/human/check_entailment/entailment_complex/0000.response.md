### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.
   - The variables `st` and `end` are initialized to 1, which will be used to count the lengths of the initial and final segments of the array that are already equal.

3. **Finding Initial and Final Segments:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `l` and `st` as long as the current element and the next element are the same.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `r` and increments `end` as long as the current element and the previous element are the same.
   - This effectively finds the longest initial and final segments of the array that are already equal.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Burles:**
   - The initial calculation of `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`, which means the cost is the length of the array minus the length of the longer segment (either initial or final).
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function updates `ans` to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, which means the cost is the length of the array minus the sum of the lengths of both segments, ensuring the result is non-negative.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for finding the initial and final segments of the array that are already equal is sound.
- The calculation of the minimum burles is correct:
  - If the array is already equal, the cost is 0.
  - If the array has a long initial or final segment of equal elements, the cost is the length of the array minus the length of the longer segment.
  - If the first and last elements are the same, the cost is the length of the array minus the sum of the lengths of both segments, ensuring the result is non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
