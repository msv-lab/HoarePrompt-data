You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        ans = ''
        i = 0
        work = True
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        print(counter)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints the length of the longest contiguous sequence of characters in `a` and `b` where each character in `a` (starting from the second character) is either equal to the previous character in `b` or follows the pattern '0' in `a` and '1' in `b`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string in certain scenarios.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0010
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0101
1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always taking the top row until it finds a point where the bottom row is lexicographically smaller. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible paths to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.
   - In the given example, the correct lexicographically smallest string is `0010`, which can be achieved by the paths:
     - (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)
     - (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)
   - The program incorrectly outputs `0101` because it does not properly handle the transition between the top and bottom rows to ensure the smallest string.

2. **Number of Paths:**
   - The program's logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also incorrect. It increments the counter based on a simple comparison of adjacent characters, which does not account for all possible valid paths.
   - In the given example, the correct number of paths is `2`, but the program outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically smallest string and the counting of paths that yield this string. Therefore, it is incorrect.
