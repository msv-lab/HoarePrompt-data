Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list. It then iterates over the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each password according to the given conditions.

2. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` separates the characters in the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit using `char.isdigit()`.

3. **Checking for Digits After Letters**: The program checks if there is any digit that appears after a letter by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable. If a letter is found after a digit, the function returns 'NO'. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

4. **Sorting and Order Check**: The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. This ensures that all digits and all letters are in the correct order.

5. **Final Return**: If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the logic for checking the password strength is sound.

Correctness: **True**
