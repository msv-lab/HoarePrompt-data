### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list (`data[0]`) is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list `data`.
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating each password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is added to the `letters` list.
   - The program also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns `'NO'` because the password violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - If either list is not sorted, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns `'YES'`.
   - This part of the program is also correct and ensures that both digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the output as required.

### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **State before `func_1` call:**
  - `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.
- **State after the first loop in `func_1`:**
  - `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the order they appear.
  - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the order they appear.
- **State after the second loop in `func_1`:**
  - `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or `-1` if there are no digits.
  - If a letter is found after a digit, the function returns `'NO'`.
- **State after sorting and comparison checks:**
  - The program ensures that `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The program ensures that `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If both conditions are met, the function returns `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the input and output correctly. The annotations confirm that the program's state and logic are consistent with the requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
