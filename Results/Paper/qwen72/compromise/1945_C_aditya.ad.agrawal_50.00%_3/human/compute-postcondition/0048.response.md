Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, if `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is still the third element in `arr`.
- `pos` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1.
- If `i` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.
- `ans` is equal to the updated value of `pos`.
- `b_d` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the updated value of `pos`.
