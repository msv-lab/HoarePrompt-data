Output State: **`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is 30001, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.**

The value of `b_d` is updated to 30001, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, and `dist` are still valid.
