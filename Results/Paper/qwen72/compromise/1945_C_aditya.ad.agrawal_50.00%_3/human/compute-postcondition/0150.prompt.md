Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of ones in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `t` is non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is not 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is equal to `pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If the conditions are not met, the state of `ans` and `b_d` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1 and `o_l` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is now equal to `pos`, and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
