Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element. `i` is the first element in `arr`. `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. If `i` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and the current value of `pos` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `b_d`.***
