Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `z_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**

The value of `pos` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`arr`, `i`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `z_l`, `b_d`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
