Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains integers derived from the characters in `input_string`, `i` is still the first element in `arr` and is 1, `pos` and `o_l` are both increased by 1, and `o_r` is now one less than its previous value.
