Postcondition: **`pos` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.**
