Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pos` is equal to `n`. `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `o_l` is the count of ones in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `z_r` is 0. `o_r` is 0. `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is minimized. `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are satisfied. `t` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied, and `t` is `t - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the conditions were last met, `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
