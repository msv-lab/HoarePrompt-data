The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be non-zero.

State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied, and `t` is non-zero**
