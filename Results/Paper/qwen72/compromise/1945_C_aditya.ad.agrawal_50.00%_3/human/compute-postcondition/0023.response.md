Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1.**

The value of `o_l` is incremented by 1, while the values of `arr`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the first element in `arr` and is 1, and `pos` is increased by 1. The output state reflects these conditions with the additional change that `o_l` is also increased by 1.
