The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line. The function does not return any value.
