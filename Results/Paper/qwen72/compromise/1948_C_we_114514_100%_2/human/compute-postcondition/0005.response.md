Output State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding `n`, `row1`, and `row2` from each test case. `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not defined outside the loop and are reset for each iteration.
