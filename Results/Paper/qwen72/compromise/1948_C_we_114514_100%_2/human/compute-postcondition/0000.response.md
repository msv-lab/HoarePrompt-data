Initial State: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input values directly, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'.

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet provided is a comment and does not directly affect the values of any variables. However, it suggests that the function `func_2` will read input values and process each test case. Since no actual code is provided to execute, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function will read input values directly, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'.**
