Output State: `t` is the same input integer representing the number of test cases. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each test case. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not retained after the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
