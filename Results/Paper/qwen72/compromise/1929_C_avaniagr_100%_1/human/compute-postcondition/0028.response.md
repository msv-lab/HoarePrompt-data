Postcondition: ***`z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 3`, and `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. If `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than the updated value of `z`.***
