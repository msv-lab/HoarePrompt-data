Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are taken from the corresponding line in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the loop checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, the loop checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, the loop calculates `z` starting from `k - 2` and updates it by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations. If `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `z`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case are processed according to the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, the loop determines whether `a` meets the required threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The loop processes each line of input exactly once, and the final output state reflects the results of all these test cases.
