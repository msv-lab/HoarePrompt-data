The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input
- `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least `k - 3`
- `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input
- `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < x - k + 3` must still be true. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `x - k + 3` must be greater than 1, which means `x - k + 3` must be at least 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least `k - 1`, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**
