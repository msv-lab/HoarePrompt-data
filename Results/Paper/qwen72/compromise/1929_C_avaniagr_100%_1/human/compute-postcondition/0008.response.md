Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9, and the input has at least 2 lines. `k` is the first integer from the second line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the second line of the input, and `a` is the third integer from the second line of the input. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`.**
