Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input.** 

The initial state of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are now assigned specific values from the third line of the input, where `k` is the first integer, `x` is the second integer, and `a` is the third integer. These values are within the specified ranges for each variable.
