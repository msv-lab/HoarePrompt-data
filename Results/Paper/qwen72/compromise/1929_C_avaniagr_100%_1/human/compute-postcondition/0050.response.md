Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input.
3. `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least \(k - 3\).
4. `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input.
5. `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated \(x - k + 3\) times, starting with \(z = k - 2\).
6. `i` is \(x - k + 2\).
7. `a` is less than `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `z` Calculation:**
   - `z` starts with the value \(k - 2\).
   - The expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` is repeated \(x - k + 3\) times.
   - This expression modifies `z` in each iteration, and the final value of `z` is used in the condition `a < z`.

2. **Understanding `i` Calculation:**
   - `i` is calculated as \(x - k + 2\).

3. **Condition `a < z`:**
   - The precondition states that `a` is less than `z` after the calculation of `z`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('NO')` statement.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`.

Output: **NO**
