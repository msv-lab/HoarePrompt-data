Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input.
3. `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input.
4. `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input.
5. `s` is the next line in the input.
6. `z` is calculated as `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`.
7. `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0.
8. `i` is calculated as `x - k + 3 - 1`.
9. `a` is less than `z`.

Given the `print('NO')` statement, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables. The statement will always print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
