### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins. If he wins, he gets `y * k` coins. If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If Sasha can win at least once, he can potentially increase his coins significantly.
   - If Sasha can lose at most `x` times in a row, he can recover from losses by placing smaller bets and gradually increasing his coins.

3. **Conditions for Guaranteeing Winning:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from losses because he can place a bet of 1 coin after each loss and still have enough coins to place another bet.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still recover from losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins initially to ensure he can place a bet after `x` consecutive losses.
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee he can place bets and recover from losses. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times in a row and then wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a common way to read from standard input in Python.
   - It splits each line into three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The program then checks the following conditions:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 1` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 2` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning. It then prints "YES" if `a >= z` and "NO" otherwise.

5. **Detailed Analysis of the Calculation:**
   - The calculation `z = k - 2` and the loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins.
   - The loop increments `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each additional loss beyond `k - 1` consecutive losses. This is a correct approach to ensure that Sasha can recover from the losses and still have enough coins to place another bet.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.
   - For `x > k - 1`, the loop ensures that the minimum number of coins required is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the conditions and edge cases described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
