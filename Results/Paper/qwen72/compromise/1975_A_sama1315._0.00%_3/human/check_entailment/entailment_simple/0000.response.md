### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. It only checks if the array is already sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem of determining if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become non-decreasing, but `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted.
   - For example, in the second test case of the problem, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by splitting it into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]` and swapping them to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, and then splitting it again into `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]` to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`. However, `func_1` would return 'No' for this array because it is not already sorted.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the given problem.
