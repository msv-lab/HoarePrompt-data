Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n - 1]` (the last value of `n` processed in the loop), `arr` is a list of the last `n` integers processed in the loop, `data` is the original list of strings, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1)` (the position after the last processed input in `data`), `results` is a list of `t` results, each result being the return value of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
