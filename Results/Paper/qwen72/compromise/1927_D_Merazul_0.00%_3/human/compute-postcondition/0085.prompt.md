Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. R is a function that maps input split by spaces to integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    *_, k = R()
    a = {*R()}
    b = {*R()}
    f = 1
    m = n = k // 2
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        u = i in a
        v = i in b
        f &= u | v
        m -= u & ~v
        n -= ~u & v
    print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `a` is a set of `n` unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces and must be greater than 0, `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are not in `a` but are in `b`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`, otherwise `n` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 0 if any integer from 1 to `k` is not in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 1, `m` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`, otherwise `m` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `i` is `k`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
