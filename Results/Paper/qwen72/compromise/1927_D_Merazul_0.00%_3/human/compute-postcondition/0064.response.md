Output State: **`a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is `k // 2`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `m = n = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`.
- The initial state values for `a`, `k`, `t`, `q`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- `n` and `m` are both updated to the value of `k // 2`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2.
