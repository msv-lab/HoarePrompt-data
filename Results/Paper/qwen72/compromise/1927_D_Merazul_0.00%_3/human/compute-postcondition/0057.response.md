To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`.
- `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces.
- `t` is an integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `n` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are not in `a` but are in `b`.
- `q` is an integer where \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`.
- `f` is 1 if every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0.
- `m` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `f ^ 1` part:**
   - `f` is either 0 or 1.
   - `f ^ 1` is the bitwise XOR operation. If `f` is 1, `f ^ 1` will be 0. If `f` is 0, `f ^ 1` will be 1.

2. **Understanding the `m | n < 0` part:**
   - `n` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are not in `a` but are in `b`. Since `n` is a count, it is always non-negative.
   - `n < 0` will always be `False` (0).
   - `m | n < 0` is equivalent to `m | False`, which simplifies to `m`.

3. **Combining the conditions:**
   - The expression `f ^ 1 or m` will evaluate to:
     - `0 or m` if `f` is 1 (since `f ^ 1` is 0).
     - `1 or m` if `f` is 0 (since `f ^ 1` is 1).
   - `0 or m` is `m` (since `m` is a non-negative integer).
   - `1 or m` is always `1` (since `1` is the highest value in the OR operation).

4. **Slicing the string 'YNEOS':**
   - The string 'YNEOS' is indexed as follows:
     - 'Y' at index 0
     - 'N' at index 1
     - 'E' at index 2
     - 'O' at index 3
     - 'S' at index 4
   - The slicing operation `::2` means starting from the evaluated index and taking every second character from that index to the end of the string.

### Evaluating the Conditions:
- If `f` is 1:
  - `f ^ 1` is 0.
  - `0 or m` is `m`.
  - The slicing operation `::2` will start from index `m` and take every second character.
  - If `m` is 0, the slicing will start from index 0: 'YNEOS'[0::2] = 'YEO'.
  - If `m` is 1, the slicing will start from index 1: 'YNEOS'[1::2] = 'NS'.
  - If `m` is 2, the slicing will start from index 2: 'YNEOS'[2::2] = 'EO'.
  - If `m` is 3, the slicing will start from index 3: 'YNEOS'[3::2] = 'O'.
  - If `m` is 4, the slicing will start from index 4: 'YNEOS'[4::2] = 'S'.

- If `f` is 0:
  - `f ^ 1` is 1.
  - `1 or m` is always 1.
  - The slicing operation `::2` will start from index 1: 'YNEOS'[1::2] = 'NS'.

### Conclusion:
- If `f` is 1, the output will be 'YEO', 'NS', 'EO', 'O', or 'S' depending on the value of `m`.
- If `f` is 0, the output will always be 'NS'.

Given the initial state and the conditions:
- If every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b` (i.e., `f` is 1), the output will depend on `m`.
- If not every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b` (i.e., `f` is 0), the output will always be 'NS'.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can only determine the output based on the value of `f`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'NS' (if f is 0) or 'YEO' (if f is 1 and m is 0), 'NS' (if f is 1 and m is 1), 'EO' (if f is 1 and m is 2), 'O' (if f is 1 and m is 3), 'S' (if f is 1 and m is 4)**.
