The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `i`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is greater than 0, which means `i` must be at least 0. Since `i` is already a non-negative integer, it meets the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, and the initial value of `j` is 0.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is True**
