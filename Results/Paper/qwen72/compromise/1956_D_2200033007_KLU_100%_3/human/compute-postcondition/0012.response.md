Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which reduces the value of `i` by 1.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is a non-negative integer and greater than 0. After the function call, `i` is still a non-negative integer but now it is greater than or equal to 0.
- The condition `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1` is updated to `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i` because `i` has been reduced by 1.
- The subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is now `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` because `i` is reduced by 1.
- The value of `arr[start_index + i]` was equal to `i` in the initial state. After the function call, the value of `arr[start_index + i]` is still equal to the new value of `i` (which is `i - 1`).
- The list `res` and the variable `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. The condition `is_already_stairs` is still False because at least one element in the new subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`.
