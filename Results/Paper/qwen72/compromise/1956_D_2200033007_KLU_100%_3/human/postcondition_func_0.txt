The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and operates on a list of integers `arr`. It returns the maximum score that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` according to a specific scoring rule. The scoring rule is as follows: if `start_index` equals `end_index`, the score is the maximum of 1 and the integer at `start_index` in `arr`. Otherwise, the score is the maximum of the square of the subarray length and the scores obtained by recursively partitioning the subarray and adding the value at the partition index. The function uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations. After the function concludes, `res_dict` contains the computed scores for the subarrays defined by the tuples (`start_index`, `end_index`).
