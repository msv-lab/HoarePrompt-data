**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an array by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
     - It uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
     - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the score is the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index`.
     - For other cases, it calculates the score by considering different partitions of the subarray and taking the maximum score from these partitions.
     - However, the scoring rule used in `func_1` does not seem to align with the MEX operation described in the problem. The function is calculating the maximum score based on a square of the subarray length and recursive partitioning, which does not directly correspond to the MEX operation.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
     - It recursively checks different conditions to determine the operations needed.
     - The function is designed to return a list of tuples representing the operations, but it relies on the incorrect scoring mechanism from `func_1`.

   - **make_stairs:**
     - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" form, where each element matches its index.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase form and, if not, recursively modifies it.
     - The function appends the necessary operations to `res` and updates the subarray accordingly.
     - The staircase form is not directly related to the MEX operation, and the function's logic does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not correctly implementing the MEX operation and the strategy to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The `make_stairs` function, while it modifies the array, does not follow the MEX operation rules and is not relevant to the problem's solution.

**Correctness: **False**

The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described. They use a different scoring mechanism and transformation strategy that do not align with the MEX operation and the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
