### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and can perform operations to replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by including the MEX of the subarray in the sum.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits of the subarray to find the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the array and the result list `res` with the operations performed.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and recursive backtracking to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the subarray is transformed correctly to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray is already in the desired form (a staircase).

7. **Complexity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the program does not perform redundant calculations.
   - The recursive backtracking ensures that the sequence of operations is constructed correctly.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
- The sequence of operations is correctly constructed to achieve this sum.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
