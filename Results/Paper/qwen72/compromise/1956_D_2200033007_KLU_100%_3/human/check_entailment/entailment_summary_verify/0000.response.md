### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not solve the problem as described. Here are the detailed issues and reasoning:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The problem requires calculating the MEX of a subarray, which is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function `func_1` does not calculate the MEX. Instead, it seems to be attempting to maximize a different value, which is not related to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to maximize a value that is a sum of squared lengths of subarrays, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

2. **Incorrect Sum Maximization**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this. The function `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to find the MEX of subarrays and apply the operations to maximize the sum.
   - The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Transformation**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" form, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
   - The function `make_stairs` checks if the subarray is already in a staircase form and modifies it if necessary. However, the transformation logic is flawed and does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly.
   - The function `make_stairs` does not correctly handle the case where the subarray is not in the staircase form and needs to be transformed to achieve the maximum sum.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the input:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
10 1
1 4
```

Explanation:
- The MEX of the entire array `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is 4.
- Applying the operation with `l=1` and `r=4` sets all elements in the subarray to 4, resulting in the array `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.
- The sum of the array is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16`.

However, the program will not produce this output. Instead, it will attempt to maximize a different value, leading to incorrect results.

### Issues in the Code

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program lacks a function to calculate the MEX of a subarray.
   - The MEX calculation should involve finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

2. **Sum Maximization**:
   - The program should use the MEX value to update the subarray and maximize the sum.
   - The recursive logic in `func_1` and `func_2` should be designed to find the optimal subarray to apply the MEX operation.

3. **Transformation**:
   - The `make_stairs` function should be replaced with a function that correctly applies the MEX operation to the subarray.
   - The function should update the subarray elements to the MEX value and record the operations.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
