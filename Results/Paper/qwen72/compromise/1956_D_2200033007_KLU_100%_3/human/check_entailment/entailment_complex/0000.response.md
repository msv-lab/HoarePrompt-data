### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
     - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` after performing the allowed operations.
     - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
     - If `start_index == end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`.
     - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively partitions the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by considering different partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function returns the maximum sum for the subarray.

   - **`func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
     - It first checks if the length of the subarray is 1 and returns an appropriate result.
     - If the maximum value (from `func_1`) is equal to the square of the subarray length, it appends the entire subarray to the result and returns.
     - Otherwise, it recursively finds the partition that achieves the maximum sum and concatenates the operations for the subarrays.

   - **`make_stairs(i)`**:
     - This function ensures that the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is in a "staircase" form, where each element matches its index from 0 to `i`.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase form and returns if it is.
     - If not, it recursively modifies the subarray to match the staircase form and appends the necessary operations to `res`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the maximum sum for a subarray by considering all possible partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
     - The memoization ensures that the function is efficient and avoids redundant calculations.
     - The base case and recursive case are handled correctly.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
     - It handles the base case (subarray length 1) and the recursive case (partitioning the subarray) appropriately.
     - The function ensures that the operations are within the allowed limit.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - The function correctly modifies the subarray to match the staircase form.
     - It appends the necessary operations to `res` and ensures that the subarray is in the correct form after the function call.
     - The function handles the base case (subarray length 1) and the recursive case (modifying the subarray) correctly.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input, calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum, and `func_2` to get the sequence of operations.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.
   - The program follows the problem description and constraints.
