#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and operates on a list of integers `arr`. It returns the maximum score that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` according to a specific scoring rule. The scoring rule is as follows: if `start_index` equals `end_index`, the score is the maximum of 1 and the integer at `start_index` in `arr`. Otherwise, the score is the maximum of the square of the subarray length and the scores obtained by recursively partitioning the subarray and adding the value at the partition index. The function uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations. After the function concludes, `res_dict` contains the computed scores for the subarrays defined by the tuples (`start_index`, `end_index`).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr), where `arr` is an array of integers. The function returns a list of tuples, each representing a segment of the array. The specific output depends on the following conditions:

- If the length of the segment (end_index - start_index + 1) is 1 and the element at `start_index` is greater than 0, the function returns an empty list.
- If the length of the segment is 1 and the element at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns a list containing a single tuple (start_index, start_index).
- If the maximum value of a certain calculation (determined by `func_1`) over the segment is equal to the square of the segment's length, the function returns a list containing the tuple (start_index, end_index).
- If the function finds a position `i` within the segment such that the sum of the element at `i` and the results of `func_1` on the segments before and after `i` equals the maximum value, the function returns the concatenation of the results of `func_2` on the segments before and after `i`.
- If the sum of the element at `start_index` and the result of `func_1` on the segment starting from `start_index + 1` equals the maximum value, the function returns the result of `func_2` on the segment starting from `start_index + 1`.
- If the sum of the element at `end_index` and the result of `func_1` on the segment ending at `end_index - 1` equals the maximum value, the function returns the result of `func_2` on the segment ending at `end_index - 1`.

In all cases, the function modifies the segment of the array between `start_index` and `end_index` to identify and return the appropriate list of tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies a list `res` to store operations as tuples `(l, r)`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form (where each element matches its index from 0 to `i`). If the subarray is already in this form, the function returns without performing any operations. If not, the function recursively modifies the subarray to ensure it matches the staircase form, appending the necessary operations to `res`. After the function concludes, `arr` will have the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` set to the staircase form, and `res` will contain the operations used to achieve this. The function does not return any value.
