Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal position to lay the road is before the first house or after the last house correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the final position to print when `left == 0` or `right == n` is flawed. For example, consider the input where `n = 3` and `s = "110"`. The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition (0 out of 0 residents on the left side and 2 out of 3 residents on the right side are satisfied). However, the program will output `1` in this case, which is incorrect.
