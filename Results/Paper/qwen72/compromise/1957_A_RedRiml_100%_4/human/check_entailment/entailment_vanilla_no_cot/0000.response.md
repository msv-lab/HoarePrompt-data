Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it only counts the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed, not the maximum number of regular polygons. The problem statement specifies that the goal is to find the maximum number of regular polygons, which can include squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc., not just triangles.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider all possible regular polygons and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed with the given sticks. The program should:

1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each stick length, determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed with that length.
3. Sum the maximum number of polygons for all stick lengths.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = {}
        
        for stick in sticks:
            if stick in freq:
                freq[stick] += 1
            else:
                freq[stick] = 1
        
        shapes = 0
        for length, count in freq.items():
            # A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides
            if count >= 3:
                # Determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with this length
                shapes += count // 3
        
        print(shapes)

# Example usage
func()
```

However, this corrected version still only counts triangles. To count all possible regular polygons, you need to consider the number of sides for each polygon:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = {}
        
        for stick in sticks:
            if stick in freq:
                freq[stick] += 1
            else:
                freq[stick] = 1
        
        shapes = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            # A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides
            if count >= 3:
                # Determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with this count
                for sides in range(3, count + 1):
                    shapes += count // sides
                    count %= sides
        
        print(shapes)

# Example usage
func()
```

This version correctly counts the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, considering all possible polygon types.
