Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `w` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of integers `palka` representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed, where a shape is defined as a set of three sticks of the same length, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `w`, `ln`, and `palka` are consumed during the process but remain unchanged in the context of the function's execution. **
