The function `func_1` processes a series of inputs, where the first input `t` specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions: if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count is greater than 2 and odd or exactly 1, it prints 'NO'; if the string '11' is present in `s`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the values of `start`, `end`, or the current directory contents.
