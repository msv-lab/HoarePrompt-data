The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be converted to integers within a specific range [start, end], where `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= start <= end. These subfolders may contain .html files. The function returns a list of all .html files found in the subfolders within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of all .html files found in subfolders within the current directory, where the subfolder names are integers within the range [start, end].**
