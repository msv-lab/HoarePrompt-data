Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `k` from input. After the loop, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations completed. The variables `n` and `k` are reset to their initial values for each iteration, and `L` is reset to an empty list for each iteration. The variable `tot` is reset to 0 for each iteration, and `pow` is reset to 1 for each iteration. The loop prints a value for each test case based on the conditions provided, but the final state of `t` is the only variable that is consistently affected by the loop, reducing it by the number of iterations.**
