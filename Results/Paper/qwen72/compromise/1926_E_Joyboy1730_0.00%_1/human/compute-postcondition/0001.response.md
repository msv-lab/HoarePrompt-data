For the given for loop to execute, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_` (which is a common placeholder for an unused variable in Python) and the variable `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, and for it to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state provided indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the loop head is correctly set up for the first iteration. The placeholder `_` is not a state that needs to be adjusted since it is just used to iterate without using the loop variable.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
