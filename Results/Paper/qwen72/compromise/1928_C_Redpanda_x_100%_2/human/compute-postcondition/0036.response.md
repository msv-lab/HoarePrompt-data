Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the generator yields the value `factor * prime_to_i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime * prime_to_i`.
- All other variables (`k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged.
- The generator still yields the value `factor * prime_to_i`, but now `prime_to_i` has been updated.
