Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the loop yields the values `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration from 0 to `factors[prime]` inclusive.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `k` remains a non-negative integer within the bounds of the `primes` list.
- The variable `rest` remains the result of `generate(k + 1)` and continues to be a non-empty iterable.
- The variable `prime` is still equal to the `k`-th element in the `primes` list.
- The variable `factor` is still the first element in the `rest` iterable.
- The variable `prime_to_i` is now equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.
- The variable `factors[prime]` must still be at least 0.
- The loop yields the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i` for each iteration, starting from `prime_to_i = 1` and incrementing `prime_to_i` by multiplying it by `prime` for each subsequent iteration, up to and including `factors[prime]` iterations.
