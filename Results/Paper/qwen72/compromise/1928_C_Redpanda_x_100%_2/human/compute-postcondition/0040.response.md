Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the generator yields the values `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`k`**: Remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes).
- **`rest`**: Remains the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
- **`prime`**: Remains equal to `primes[k]`.
- **`factor`**: Remains the next element in `rest`.
- **`prime_to_i`**: After all iterations of the loop, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`. This is because `prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime` in each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times.
- **`factors[prime]`**: Must be at least 0, as this is a condition for the loop to execute.
- **Yielded Values**: The loop yields the value `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration, where `prime_to_i` starts at 1 and is multiplied by `prime` in each iteration. Thus, the values yielded are `factor * 1`, `factor * prime`, `factor * prime^2`, ..., `factor * prime^(factors[prime])`.
