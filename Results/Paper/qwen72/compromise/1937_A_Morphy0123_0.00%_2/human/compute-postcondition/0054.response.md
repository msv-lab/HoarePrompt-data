Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power)}\).
   - `power` is the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\).
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) but \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\).
   - This means `power` is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - This will print \(2^{(power)}\).

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `power` is the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\), the value of \(2^{(power)}\) is the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the output will be the value of \(2^{(power)}\).

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the largest integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\))**
