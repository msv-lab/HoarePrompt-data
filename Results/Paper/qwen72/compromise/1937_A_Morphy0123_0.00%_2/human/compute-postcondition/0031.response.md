Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n_cases`**: Remains greater than 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`power`**: After the loop finishes, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}}\) is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that `power` will be the smallest integer that satisfies the condition \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). For example, if `n` is 32, `power` will be 6 because \(2^6 = 64\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 32.
