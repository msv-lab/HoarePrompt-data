The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the comparison `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 4. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`, which is 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
