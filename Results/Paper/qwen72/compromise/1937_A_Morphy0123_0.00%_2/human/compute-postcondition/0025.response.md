The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`. The loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`. Given the state before the loop: `n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Since `log2(n)` is greater than 1 when `n` is greater than 2 (because `log2(2)` is 1), we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `power` is 1**
