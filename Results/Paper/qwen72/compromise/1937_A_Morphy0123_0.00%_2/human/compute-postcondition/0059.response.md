Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a result based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
