Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `power` is not updated.**

Explanation: The code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `power` is not updated by this code snippet, so its state remains as it was in the initial state, which is not specified. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `n_cases` and `i`, and the new value of `n` as an input integer.
