Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - `log2(n)` must be greater than `power - 1`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `power` is given as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - However, the precondition also states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.
   - This implies that `n` itself is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

4. **Determine the Value of `power`:**
   - For `n` to be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, `n` must be a power of 2.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, then `log2(4) = 2`, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 is 2. But since `power` is equal to `n`, `power` would be 4.
   - This is a contradiction because `power` should be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, not `n` itself.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the contradiction in the precondition, it is not possible for `power` to be equal to `n` while also being the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - Therefore, the precondition is invalid, and we cannot determine a consistent value for `power`.

However, if we assume the precondition is meant to be interpreted as `power` being the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, then:

- `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
- `2 ** power` will be the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 2, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` will be `2 ** power`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(n))**
