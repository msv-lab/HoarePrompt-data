Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\), and `power` is not equal to `n`.***
