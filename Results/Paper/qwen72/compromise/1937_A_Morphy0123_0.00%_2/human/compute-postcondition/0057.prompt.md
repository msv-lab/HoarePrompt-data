Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an input integer, and the function does not take any input parameters, but it is implied that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `power`. If `n` is greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the same. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\), and `power` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `power` remains unchanged if `n` is 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\) and `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\). Otherwise, `power` is updated to the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
