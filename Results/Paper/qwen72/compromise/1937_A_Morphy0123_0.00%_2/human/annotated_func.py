#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be called with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a, and the function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and `n` is an input integer for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\) where `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\). Otherwise, the output is \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a result based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
