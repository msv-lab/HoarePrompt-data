You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The values of x and n are updated for each iteration based on user input, and the loop prints the maximum value of the divisors of x that are less than or equal to k (where k = x // n) for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to divide a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( n \), then the optimal solution is to divide \( x \) into \( n \) equal sub-problems, each of difficulty \( \frac{x}{n} \). The GCD of these sub-problems will be \( \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \), we need to find the largest integer \( d \) such that \( d \) divides \( x \) and \( d \) can be the GCD of \( n \) sub-problems. This means \( x \) must be divisible by \( d \) and \( \frac{x}{d} \) must be at least \( n \).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( x \) and \( n \).
   - It calculates \( k = \frac{x}{n} \), which is the average difficulty of each sub-problem.
   - If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1 because the only way to divide \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.
   - Otherwise, it initializes \( ans \) to 1 and iterates over possible divisors of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) (inclusive), checking if \( x \) is divisible by the current divisor \( i \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it checks if \( i \) or \( \frac{x}{i} \) can be the GCD of the sub-problems by ensuring they are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It updates \( ans \) to the maximum of the current \( ans \) and the valid divisors found.
   - Finally, it prints \( ans \).

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \) by printing 1.
   - The program iterates over possible divisors of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - It correctly checks if the divisor \( i \) or \( \frac{x}{i} \) can be the GCD of the sub-problems by ensuring they are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - The program updates \( ans \) to the maximum valid divisor found, which ensures that the maximum balance is achieved.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 5 \) and \( n = 5 \), the program correctly prints 1 because the only way to divide 5 into 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.
   - For \( x = 10 \) and \( n = 3 \), the program correctly prints 2 because the optimal way is to divide 10 into sub-problems with difficulties 4, 2, and 4, giving a GCD of 2.
   - For \( x = 420 \) and \( n = 69 \), the program correctly prints 6 because 420 can be divided into 69 sub-problems each with difficulty 6, giving a GCD of 6.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the given test cases and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
