Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not simulate the actual game where Anna reverses the digits of a number and Sasha concatenates two numbers. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of trailing zeros in the numbers and using that to determine the winner, which is not aligned with the game rules.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Anna
```

In this case, Anna can reverse the number 2 to 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Anna" because it does not simulate the actual game moves.
