Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix is incorrect. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` does not match the expected maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is indeed \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - For an \( n \times n \) matrix, each row and each column can be filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum of all elements in the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads an integer \( n \) and prints the sum `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the number of operations `2 * n`.
   - It then prints \( 2n \) operations, each of which assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to either a row or a column.

3. **Verification of Operations**:
   - The operations are valid and do not exceed the limit of \( 2n \).
   - Each operation assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to a row or a column, which is a valid permutation.
   - However, the sum calculated by the program is incorrect, as shown by the example for \( n = 2 \).

4. **Example for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - Correct maximum sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
   - Program's calculated sum: \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect formula for the maximum sum. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case.

Final: **False**
