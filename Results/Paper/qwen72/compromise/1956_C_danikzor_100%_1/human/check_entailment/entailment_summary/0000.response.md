Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating through each test case, calling the function `func_1` for each one. This matches the problem description.

2. **Output Values**:
   - The first value printed is the maximum sum of the matrix, which is calculated as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared, which is the correct maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix where each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The second value printed is `2 * n`, which is the number of operations used. This is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program performs `2n` operations, which is the maximum allowed. Each operation is of type 1 or type 2.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a type 1 operation, setting the entire row to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a type 2 operation, setting the entire column to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

4. **Permutations**:
   - The permutation used in both type 1 and type 2 operations is `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Matrix Sum**:
   - The sum of the matrix after these operations is indeed `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This is because each row and each column will be filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, and the sum of this permutation is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since each element appears `2n` times in the matrix, the total sum is `n * (n + 1) // 2 * 2n`, which simplifies to `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses exactly `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit and is efficient for the problem constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
