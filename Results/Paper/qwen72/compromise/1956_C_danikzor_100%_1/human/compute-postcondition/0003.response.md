Output State: **The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `t` (the number of test cases) also remains unchanged. The loop prints two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, where the first line starts with `1` followed by `i` and then the integers from `n` to `1` in descending order, and the second line starts with `2` followed by `i` and then the integers from `n` to `1` in descending order.**
