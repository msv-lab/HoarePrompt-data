Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by checking the count of '1's in each row of the grid. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's definition. Specifically:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program assumes that if any row contains exactly one '1', the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially in the middle rows. The correct way to identify a triangle is to check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers centered around a column.

2. **Square Identification**: The program assumes that if any row contains more than one '1', the shape is a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1'. The correct way to identify a square is to check if every row has the same number of consecutive '1's starting from the same column.

3. **Handling Multiple Rows**: The program only checks the count of '1's in each row independently and does not consider the overall structure of the shape. This means it might incorrectly classify a triangle as a square or vice versa.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
