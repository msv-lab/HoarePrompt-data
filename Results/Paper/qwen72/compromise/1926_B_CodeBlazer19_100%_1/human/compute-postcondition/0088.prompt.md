Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string, `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` has more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. If no input string `s` has exactly one '1', `a` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the new input string, and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string and `a` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, then `b` is set to 'SQUARE' and `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
