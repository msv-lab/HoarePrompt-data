Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string provided by the user. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0. If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. The current value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE', indicating that at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character.**
