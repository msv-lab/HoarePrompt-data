Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is an input string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is greater than 1, `a` is 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is 0, `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
