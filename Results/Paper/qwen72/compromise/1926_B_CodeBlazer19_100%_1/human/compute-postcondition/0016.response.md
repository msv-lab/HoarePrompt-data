The code snippet `a = 'TRIANGLE'` assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This overrides any previous value of `a`. The conditions regarding the count of '1' in the string `s` no longer affect the value of `a` because it is explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` remains an empty string.**
