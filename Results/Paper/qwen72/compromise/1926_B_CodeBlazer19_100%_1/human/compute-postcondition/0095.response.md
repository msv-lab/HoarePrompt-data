The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid.
  - A grid represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, either '0' or '1'.

The function processes each test case to determine whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a grid of size `n x n` containing characters '0' or '1'. It returns the type of shape (triangle or square) that includes all the '1's in the grid, ensuring the shape's size is greater than 1.**
