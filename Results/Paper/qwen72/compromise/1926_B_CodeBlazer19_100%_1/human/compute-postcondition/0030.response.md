Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is either an empty string (`''`) or `'SQUARE'`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(b)
```

This statement will print the value of the variable `b`. According to the initial state, `b` can be one of two values: an empty string (`''`) or the string `'SQUARE'`.

Since the exact value of `b` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine whether it is an empty string or `'SQUARE'`. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual value of `b`.

Output: **b (where b is either an empty string or 'SQUARE')**
