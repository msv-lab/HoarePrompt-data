Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines whether the grid contains a shape (triangle or square) that includes all the '1's. If any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. If no row contains exactly one '1', it defaults to printing 'SQUARE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
