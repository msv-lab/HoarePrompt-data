Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `n` is an input integer. After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined (as they are reassigned in each iteration), and `i` is equal to `n-1` (the last index of the loop). The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions provided.**
