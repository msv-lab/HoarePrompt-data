Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate `n` times, processing each test case. This is also consistent with the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This correctly parses the input as three separate digits.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair. This is correct according to the problem description.
   - The second condition `elif a < b and b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak. This is also correct according to the problem description.
   - The `else` block handles all other cases where neither a stair nor a peak is formed, and prints "NONE". This is correct as well.

5. **Output**: The function prints the appropriate string for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly states that the function processes a series of test cases.
   - It accurately describes the conditions under which "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE" are printed.
   - It correctly notes that the function does not return any value and that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined after the loop completes.
   - The loop index `i` is indeed equal to `n-1` after the loop completes, but this is not relevant to the correctness of the program.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), correctly outputting "NONE".
   - The program also handles the edge case where the digits are in a non-increasing or non-decreasing order (e.g., `3 2 1` or `1 1 2`), correctly outputting "NONE".

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles all specified cases.

Final: **True**
