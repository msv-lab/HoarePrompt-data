To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `q` and `t`.

- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- The variable `q` is the loop iterator.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `q` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0**
