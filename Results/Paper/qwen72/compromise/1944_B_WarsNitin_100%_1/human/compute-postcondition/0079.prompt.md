Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and the loop will not run again because the condition `i < n-1` will no longer be satisfied. The value of `k` will be set to `req`. The value of `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive elements in `b` that are equal, and `ans1` will contain two copies of each such element. The list `l` will contain all elements in `b` (from index 1 to `n-2`) that are not equal to their next element in the list. If `k` becomes 0 at any point during the loop's execution, the loop will terminate early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `k` is 0 and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2, and `ans2` contains the values of `c[0]` and `c[1]`. If `k` is 0 and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged. If `k` is not 0, the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the element at index 3 of `c` appended to its previous contents. If `c[3] != c[2]`, `k` remains 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
