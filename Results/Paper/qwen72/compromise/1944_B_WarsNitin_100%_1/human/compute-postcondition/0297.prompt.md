Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `k` is `req - 2 * num_pairs`, where `num_pairs` is the number of pairs of consecutive equal elements found in `c` between indices 1 and `n-2`. `ans2` contains each element from `c` that was found to be equal to its preceding element, appended twice. The loop has completed all iterations unless `k` became 0 before the loop finished, in which case the loop broke early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` contains the first element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l`, `k` is `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` has at least two elements, `ans1` contains the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `k` is `k - 3`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
