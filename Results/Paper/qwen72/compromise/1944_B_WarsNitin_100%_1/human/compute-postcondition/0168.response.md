Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2` (and its current value is -2 if the condition `k == 0` was true before the execution), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. `ans2` now includes the value of `c[2]` in addition to any previous values.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[2]` to the list `ans2`.
- Since `i` is 2, the value of `c[2]` is added to `ans2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
