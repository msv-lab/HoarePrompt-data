Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2` (and its current value is -2 if the condition `k == 0` was true before the execution), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`.**
