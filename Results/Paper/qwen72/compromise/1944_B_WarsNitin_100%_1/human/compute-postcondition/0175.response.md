Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[3]` in addition to any previous values.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`.
- Given that `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
