The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `n` must still be greater than 3 to ensure that `i` is within the valid range.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
