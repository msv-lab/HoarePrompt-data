Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `l` must contain at least 2 elements, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, plus the first element of `l` (appended once), `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - 1` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the first element of `l` appended once. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
