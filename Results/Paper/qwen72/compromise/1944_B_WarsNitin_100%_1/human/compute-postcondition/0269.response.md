Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is `req - 2` if `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, and `k` is `req - 4` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[i]`.***
