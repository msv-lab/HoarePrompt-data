Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req` (and its current value is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, the value `c[1]` is appended to `ans2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` twice.
