Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, and `k` is now equal to `req`. `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration. `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2` (and its current value is -2 if the condition `k == 0` was true before the execution), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2` (or -2 if `k == 0` was true before the execution), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[2]` in addition to any previous values, and `k` is updated to `req - 4` (or -4 if `k == 0` was true before the execution). If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[3]` in addition to any previous values, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
