Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `req - 2`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`.**
