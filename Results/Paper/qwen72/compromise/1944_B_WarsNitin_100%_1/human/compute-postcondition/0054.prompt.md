Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains two instances of the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times the original input integer, `l` is a list that may contain the first element of `b` if it is not equal to the second element of `b`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `l` remains as it was initially.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` (which is also `b[0]`), and `ans1` now includes an additional element which is `b[1]`. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `l` now contains the value of `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` contains `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and the other conditions (`ans1`, `k`, `l`, etc.) remain unchanged. If `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 3 and 2 of `b`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[3]` does not equal `b[2]`, `l` now includes the element `b[3]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
