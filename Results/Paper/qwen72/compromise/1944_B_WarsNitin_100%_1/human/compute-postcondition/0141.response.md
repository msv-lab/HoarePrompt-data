The code snippet `l.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `b` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`.**
