Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = []` initializes `l` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
