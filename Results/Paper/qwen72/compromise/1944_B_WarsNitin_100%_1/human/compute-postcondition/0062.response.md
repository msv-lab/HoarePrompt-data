Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[1]`) to the list `ans2`. Since `ans2` initially contained the value of `c[0]`, after the execution, `ans2` now contains both `c[0]` and `c[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `c[i]` is still equal to `c[i - 1]`.
