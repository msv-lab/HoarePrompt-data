Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. a is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` will contain the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `ans2` will contain the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, and `k` will be `max(0, k - len(l))`. If `k` reaches 0 at any point during the loop's execution, the loop will terminate early.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` contains all its original elements, `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - len(l)` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended once, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has at least `k` elements (or fewer if `k` reached 0 before the loop finished), `ans1` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
