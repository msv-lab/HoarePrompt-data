The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold true, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
