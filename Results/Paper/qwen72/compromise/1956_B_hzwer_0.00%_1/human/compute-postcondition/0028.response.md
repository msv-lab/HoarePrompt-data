Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is 0. The `dp` table is filled such that for each `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, the value `dp[i][j]` is set based on the count of the integer `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears at least twice, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `dp` table is fully populated with values based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated according to the count of the integer `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The loop ensures that the `dp` table reflects the maximum possible values based on the given conditions, and the loop variable `j` is set to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The other variables, such as `n`, `i`, and `t`, remain unchanged from their initial values.
