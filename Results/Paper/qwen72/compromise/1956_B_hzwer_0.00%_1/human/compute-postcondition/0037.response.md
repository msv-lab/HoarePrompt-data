Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop, including `dp[i][j]` which is now the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, and the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is greater than 1.**
