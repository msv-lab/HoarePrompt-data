To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, so `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `n` is at least 3, this condition is already satisfied. The variable `j` is initialized to `n - 1` for the loop to start correctly.

Let's break it down:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
2. **Initial State**: `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n - 4`. `j` is 0.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` starts at `n - 1` and decrements down to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 3, which means `n - 1` is at least 2.
- `j` needs to start at `n - 1` for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `j` starts at `n - 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 1`.**
