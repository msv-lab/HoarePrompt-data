Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 3`. `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1) and each element is initialized to 0, except for the values that have been updated by the loop.
- `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 3`.
- The code snippet updates `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- Substituting `i` and `j` with `n - 3`, the code updates `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The other elements of `dp` that were not affected by this update remain the same.
