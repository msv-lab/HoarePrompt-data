Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `cards` from the input. It then computes and returns the maximum number of cards that can be taken under the given conditions, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`. The conditions are such that each integer from 1 to `n` can appear at most twice in the `cards` list. The function uses dynamic programming to determine this maximum number. **
