The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, so `j` will be `n - 2`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `n` is at least 3, `n - 2` is at least 1, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
