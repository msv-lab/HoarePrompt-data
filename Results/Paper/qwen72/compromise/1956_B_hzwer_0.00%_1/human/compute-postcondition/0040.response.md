The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1` and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n - 2`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
