Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.** 

In natural language: The 2D list `dp` remains the same in terms of its dimensions and initialization, but the value at `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the same as the value at `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
