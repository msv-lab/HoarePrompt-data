To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. However, given the initial state, `n` is already at least 3, so the loop will execute at least twice.

The initial state of `j` is `n - 3`, but for the loop to start, `j` must be set to `n - 1`. 

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, `j` is `n - 1`**
