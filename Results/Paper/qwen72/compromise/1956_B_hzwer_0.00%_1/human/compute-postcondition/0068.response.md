Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.**
