Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the `func_1` function is not correctly implemented to reflect the optimal play strategy for both players. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the correct output because the DP table is not being filled correctly to account for the optimal moves of both players. The logic in the DP table is flawed, and it does not consider the optimal strategy for Nene to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated DP or greedy algorithm that accurately models the game's rules and the optimal strategies of both players. The current implementation does not correctly handle the turn-based nature of the game and the conditions under which points are awarded.
