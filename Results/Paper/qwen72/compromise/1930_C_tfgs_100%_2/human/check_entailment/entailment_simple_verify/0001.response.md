### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to perform operations on an array `a` and an empty set `S` to construct a new array `b` that is the lexicographically largest possible sorted in descending order.
   - Each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a[i] + i` into `S`, and deleting `a[i]` from `a`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It reads the length `n` of the array `a`.
     - It reads the elements of `a` and modifies each element by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
     - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
     - It converts the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
     - It initializes `cnt` to the number of elements that were not unique in the modified array.
     - It constructs the array `ans` by:
       - For each unique element in `a`, it adds the element to `ans`.
       - It also adds elements that are just below the current element to `ans` to ensure the largest possible lexicographical order.
     - Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element.
   - It correctly uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
   - It correctly converts the modified array to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - The logic to construct `ans` by adding elements that are just below the current element to `ans` ensures that the array `b` is lexicographically largest.
   - The program handles the case where there are duplicate elements by adding the necessary elements to `ans` to maintain the largest possible order.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are unique.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - The program ensures that the final array `ans` is of the correct length and is sorted in descending order.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it involves sorting and set operations which are typically `O(n log n)`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the elements of `a`.

- **Modification of Array `a`:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n): a[i] += i + 1` correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1`.

- **Counting and Removing Duplicates:**
  - The `Counter` object `counter` is used to count the occurrences of each modified element.
  - Converting `a` to a set and sorting it in descending order ensures that `a` contains unique elements in the correct order.

- **Constructing Array `ans`:**
  - The program initializes `cnt` to the number of elements that were not unique in the modified array.
  - The loop `for i in range(len(a))` constructs `ans` by:
    - Adding elements that are just below the current element to `ans` to ensure the largest possible lexicographical order.
    - This is done by calculating `adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and appending `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in `range(adv)`.
    - It then appends the current element `a[i]` to `ans`.
    - It updates the `counter` and `cur` to reflect the changes in the frequency of elements.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - The loop `for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` ensures that `ans` is of the correct length and fills any remaining gaps with the necessary elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the problem description. It handles the operations and edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
