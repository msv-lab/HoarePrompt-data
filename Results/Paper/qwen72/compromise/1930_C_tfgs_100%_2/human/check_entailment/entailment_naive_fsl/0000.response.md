Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the same value is inserted multiple times into the set, which should result in only one unique value being added. However, the program's logic for constructing the final array `b` assumes that all values are unique, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
3 2
```
However, if the input is:
```
1
2
1 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 1
```
But the program will output:
```
2 2
```
This is because the program incorrectly handles the insertion of duplicate values and their subsequent processing. The logic for constructing `b` does not account for the fact that the set `S` will only contain unique elements, and the `Counter` is not necessary for this problem. The program should directly handle the set and sort it in descending order to construct `b`.
