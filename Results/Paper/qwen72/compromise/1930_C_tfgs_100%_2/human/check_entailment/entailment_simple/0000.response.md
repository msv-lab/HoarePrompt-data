### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is necessary to simulate the insertion of `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the unique elements in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure that the array `b` is lexicographically largest, it fills in the gaps between the elements of `a` by appending the largest possible values that are not already in `ans`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` by decrementing the last element of `ans` until the length of `ans` matches `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Modification of `a`:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n): a[i] += i + 1` correctly modifies each element of `a` as required by the problem statement.

- **Counting and Sorting:**
  - Using `Counter` to count the frequency of each element is a good approach.
  - Converting `a` to a set and sorting it in descending order ensures that we have the unique elements in the correct order.

- **Constructing `b`:**
  - The program correctly handles the gaps between elements by using the `min` function to determine how many elements to append between the current and the next element.
  - The `cur` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements that can be added to fill the gaps.
  - The `cnt` variable is used to track the remaining number of elements to be added to `ans`.

- **Final Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should handle edge cases where all elements in `a` are the same. In such cases, the `Counter` will have a single key with a high frequency, and the program should correctly fill the gaps.
  - The program should also handle cases where the elements of `a` are already in a form that results in a large number of unique elements after modification.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it uses a `Counter` and sorting, both of which are linearithmic operations.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and handle the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
