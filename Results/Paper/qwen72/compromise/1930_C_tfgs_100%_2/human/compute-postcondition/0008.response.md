Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; for each index `j` in the list `a`, `a[j]` is now `a[j] + (j + 1)`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. Each element in the list `a` has been incremented by its index plus one. For example, the first element `a[0]` has been incremented by 1, the second element `a[1]` has been incremented by 2, and so on, up to the last element `a[n-1]` which has been incremented by `n`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` now contains the updated values after the loop has finished executing.
