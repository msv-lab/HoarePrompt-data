The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `adv`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 again, so `j` is `j + 1` (or `j + 2` relative to the state before the last iteration).
- `adv` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains one more element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `adv` must be greater than `j + 1`**
