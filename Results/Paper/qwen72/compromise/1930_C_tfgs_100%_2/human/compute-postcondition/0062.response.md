The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state (such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cur`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
