Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than `j + 2`, `ans` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `adv` remains greater than `j + 2`.
- The list `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- The value of `j` is incremented by 2, so it is now `j + 2`.
