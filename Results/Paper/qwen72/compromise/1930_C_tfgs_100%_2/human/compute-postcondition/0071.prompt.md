You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; for each index `j` in the list `a`, `a[j]` is now `a[j] + (j + 1)`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the frequency of all elements in `a` is now 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing `n` integers, where the first `len(a)` elements are the elements of `a` in the same order, and the remaining elements are integers that fill the gaps between the elements of `a` such that all integers from 1 to the maximum element in `a` are represented in `ans`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated with `cnt` new elements, each being the last element of `ans` minus 1, until the loop finishes.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: (nothing printed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
