The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing

The state of `a[1]` being `a[1] + 2` does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2; `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 2`.**
