Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - For the first `k` buns, the price is `(b - i + 1)` coins, where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if a given `k` is valid by calculating the profit and comparing it to `n * max(a, b)`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `low = 0` and `high = n`.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and checks if `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`.
   - If `True`, it updates `ans` to `mid` and moves the search to the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `False`, it moves the search to the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the profit for selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit is calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
   - It returns `True` if the calculated profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit for the first `k` buns should be the sum of the series `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - The profit for the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit should be the sum of these two parts.

6. **Issue in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the profit for the first `k` buns as `k * b`.
   - The correct calculation should be the sum of the series `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `k`, which is the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: `k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2`.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The binary search logic is correct in terms of finding the optimal `k`.
   - However, the profit calculation in `func_1` is incorrect, which will lead to incorrect results.

Given the issues in the profit calculation, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
