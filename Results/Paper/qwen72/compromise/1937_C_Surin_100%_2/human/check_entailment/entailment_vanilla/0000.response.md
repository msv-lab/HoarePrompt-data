### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The goal is to use these queries to identify the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize the XOR operation.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \(v1\) of the largest element in the permutation \(p\). This is done by comparing each element \(p_i\) with \(p_0\) using the query "? 0 0 i i".
   - If the result is "<", it means \(p_i\) is larger than \(p_0\), and \(v1\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - After identifying \(v1\), the program tries to find another index \(prev\) such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) using the query "? v1 i v1 prev".
   - If the result is ">", it means \(p_i\) is a better candidate for \(prev\), and \(prev\) is updated to \(i\).
   - If the result is "=", it further checks \(p_i\) against \(p_{prev}\) using the query "? i i prev prev" to ensure the correct update.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After the loop, the program outputs the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the pair that maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times, and the second loop also runs \(n-1\) times.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2(n-1)\), which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as it will directly output the two indices \(0\) and \(1\) after the first loop.
   - The program also handles the case where the permutation is already sorted or has a specific pattern, as it always finds the maximum XOR by comparing all elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and uses a valid strategy to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
