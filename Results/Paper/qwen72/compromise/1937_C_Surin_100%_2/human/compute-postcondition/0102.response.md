To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1` (this doesn't affect the `print` statement directly, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the input string from the last iteration.
   - If `r` is `<` at the last iteration, `v1` is `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - `v1` depends on the value of `r` from the last iteration:
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`.
     - If `r` is not `<`, then `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1 and `prev` is 0, these values are straightforward.
   - The value of `v1` depends on the condition of `r`:
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`.
     - If `r` is not `<`, then `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- **Case 1: `r` is `<`**
  - `v1` is `n-1`.
  - The output will be: `? n-1 1 n-1 0`.

- **Case 2: `r` is not `<`**
  - `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
  - Since `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` will also be `n-1` in this case.
  - The output will be: `? n-1 1 n-1 0`.

In both cases, the value of `v1` is `n-1`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0 (where n is the input integer greater than 1)**
