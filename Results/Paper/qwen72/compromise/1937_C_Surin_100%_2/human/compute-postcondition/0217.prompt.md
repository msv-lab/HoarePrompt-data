You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where it receives input through queries and outputs indices. The input includes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the size of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: After all iterations, `kp` is equal to the input integer provided at the start of the loop, `n` is the last input integer provided within the loop, `v1` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `<` or 0 if `r` was never `<`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, and the output buffer has been flushed. The loop prints the final result as `! {prev} {v1}`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to determine indices based on the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It can make at most 3n queries and the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
