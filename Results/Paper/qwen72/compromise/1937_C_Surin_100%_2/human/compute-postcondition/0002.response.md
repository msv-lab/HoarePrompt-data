The only objects in the loop head are `kp` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `kp` should be initialized to 0, and the input provided should be a positive integer.

State: **`kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
