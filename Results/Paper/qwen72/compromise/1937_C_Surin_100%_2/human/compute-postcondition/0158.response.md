Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
   - `kp` is `kp + 2`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is 2.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v2` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `v1` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1, and the print statement will output:
     ```
     ? 1 1 2 2
     ```
   - If `r` is not `<` (i.e., `r` is `>` or `=`), then `v1` remains 0, and the print statement will output:
     ```
     ? 0 0 2 2
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both cases.
   - The output will be one of the two possible strings based on the value of `r`.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if r is `<`), or ? 0 0 2 2 (if r is `>` or `=`)**
