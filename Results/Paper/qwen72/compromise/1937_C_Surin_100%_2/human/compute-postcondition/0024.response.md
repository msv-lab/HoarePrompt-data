Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the input string provided by the user. If the user inputs '<', the current value of `r` is '<'. Otherwise, the value of `r` remains unchanged.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` has no impact on the variables or the input string `r`. It only ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which was already stated in the initial state. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
