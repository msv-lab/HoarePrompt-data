Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `r` is an input string, `r2` is an input string, `prev` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The value of `prev` is updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The conditions for `r` and `r2` do not change the state of `prev` after this assignment. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
