Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

The variable `v1` is now assigned the value 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
