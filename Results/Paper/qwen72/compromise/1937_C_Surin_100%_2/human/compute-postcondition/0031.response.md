To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` will start from 1.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the variables:
- `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we don't know its exact value.
- `i` is explicitly defined as starting from 1.
- `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we don't know its exact value.

Given the lack of specific values for `v1` and `prev`, we can only describe their values in general terms based on the context provided.

Output:
**? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the value of the variable `v1` and [prev] is the value of the variable `prev`)**

Explanation:
- The `?` is a literal character.
- `v1` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state.
- `i` is 1, as it starts from 1.
- `v1` is repeated, so it will have the same value as the first occurrence.
- `prev` is another variable whose value is not specified in the initial state.
