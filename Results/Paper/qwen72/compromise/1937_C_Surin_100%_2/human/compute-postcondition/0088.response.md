Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 2, `r` is `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
