Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `v1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 1, and all other initial conditions still hold true.
