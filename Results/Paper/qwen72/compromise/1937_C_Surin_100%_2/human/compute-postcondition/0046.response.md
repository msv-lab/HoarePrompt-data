The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is the input provided by the user, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
