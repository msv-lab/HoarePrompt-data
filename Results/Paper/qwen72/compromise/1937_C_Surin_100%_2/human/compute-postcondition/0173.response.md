To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Variables in the `print` statement:**
   - `v1`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `i`: This is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `prev`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

- The `?` is a literal character.
- `v1` is a variable whose value is unknown.
- `i` is 1.
- `v1` is repeated, so it will print the same unknown value again.
- `prev` is a variable whose value is unknown.

Since `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, we can only describe their values as unknown. The `print` statement will output a string with these variables' values.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev] (where [v1] and [prev] are the values of the variables `v1` and `prev`, respectively, and `i` is 1)**
