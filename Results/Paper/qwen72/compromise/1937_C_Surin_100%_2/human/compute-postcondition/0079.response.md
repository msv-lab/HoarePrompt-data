Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 0.
   - `v2` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `v1` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `v2` is explicitly given as 1.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - The string will be `? 0 0 1 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
