Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
