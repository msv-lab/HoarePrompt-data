The `sys.stdout.flush()` command flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state in terms of variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is 0, 1, or 2, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.**
