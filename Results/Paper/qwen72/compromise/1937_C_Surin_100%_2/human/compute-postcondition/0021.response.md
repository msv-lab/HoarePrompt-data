The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the input string provided by the user. If the user inputs '<', the current value of `r` is '<'. Otherwise, the value of `r` remains unchanged.**
