Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is 0, 1, or 2.
- `kp` is `kp + 1` (though `kp` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `g` is 0 (also not used in the print statement).
- `v2` is `n - 1`.
- `r` is the new input string.
- The output buffer has been flushed (this is a detail about the environment, not directly relevant to the print statement).

### Conditions for `v1`:
- If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

### Conditions for `prev`:
- If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2.
- If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2.
- If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `v1`**:
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, then `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - If the previous `r` was not `<`, then `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
   - Since `v2` is `n - 1`, if the previous `r` was not `<`, `v1` will also be `n - 1`.

2. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

3. **Determine `prev`**:
   - `prev` is 0, 1, or 2 based on the initial state.
   - The value of `prev` will be updated based on the current `r`:
     - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2.
     - If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2.
     - If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.

### Conclusion:
- `v1` will be `n - 1` regardless of the previous `r` value.
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` will be 2 if `r` is `>` or `=`, and will remain 0 or 1 if `r` is neither `>` nor `=`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [prev] (where [n-1] is the value of n-1 and [prev] is 2 if r is `>` or `=`, and 0 or 1 otherwise)**
