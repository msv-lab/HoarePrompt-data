Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string. If `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is set to 3. If `r` is equal to '=', `r2` is a new input string. If `r2` is equal to '<', `prev` is set to 3. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.***
