Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `r` is the final input string, and `v1` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `<` or 0 if `r` was never `<`. The output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `prev`, `r`, or `v1`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
