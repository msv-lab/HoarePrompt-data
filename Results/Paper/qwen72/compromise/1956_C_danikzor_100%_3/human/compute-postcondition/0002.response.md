The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 1. The state of `func_1` and the description about the function's purpose are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
