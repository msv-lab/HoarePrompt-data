Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations allowed are:

1. Type 1 operation: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), then assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
2. Type 2 operation: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), then assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix, and the program should ensure that no more than \( 2n \) operations are used.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads an integer \( n \) from the input, which represents the size of the matrix.
   - It prints the maximum sum of the matrix, which is calculated as \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \). This formula is correct for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, each appearing \( n \) times in the matrix.
   - It prints the number of operations, which is \( 2n \). This is within the allowed limit.
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the same permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification of the Solution

- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  - The formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \) is correct for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, each appearing \( n \) times in the matrix. This is because the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \), and each number appears \( n \) times in the matrix, so the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program performs exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Operations:**
  - Each Type 1 operation sets the entire row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - Each Type 2 operation sets the entire column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - Since the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is used in both types of operations, the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible values, ensuring the sum is maximized.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations within the allowed limit. The operations used ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, thus maximizing the sum.
