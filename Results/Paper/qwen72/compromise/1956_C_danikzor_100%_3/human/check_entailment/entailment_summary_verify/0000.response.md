### Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since each element in the matrix can be any of these numbers, the maximum sum for the entire matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads the integer `n` from the input.
   - It prints the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - It also prints the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations, setting each row and each column to the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - `func_1` reads `n` and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It prints \( 2n \) lines, each describing an operation to set a row or a column to the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The operations are redundant and do not contribute to the correctness of the solution.

6. **Verification**:
   - **Formula Verification**:
     - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is indeed incorrect. For \( n = 2 \), it calculates \( 7 \), which is not the maximum sum.
     - The correct formula \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \) should be used instead.
   - **Operations Verification**:
     - The operations performed by the program are not necessary to achieve the maximum sum. The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each row and each column to any permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
     - The operations in the program set each row and each column to the permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1, which is one valid way to achieve the maximum sum, but it is not the most efficient or necessary way.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying the incorrect formula for the maximum sum. However, the operations themselves, while not the most efficient, do indeed achieve the maximum sum. The redundancy in operations does not affect the correctness of the solution, but it does not align with the problem's requirement to use no more than \( 2n \) operations efficiently.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum. The operations, while achieving the correct sum, are not necessary and do not align with the problem's requirement for efficiency.
