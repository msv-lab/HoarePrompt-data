The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
