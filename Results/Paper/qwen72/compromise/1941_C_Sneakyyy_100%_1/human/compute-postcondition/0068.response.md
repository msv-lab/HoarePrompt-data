Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `ans` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, depending on the value of `s`.
- The length condition for `a` also remains the same.
