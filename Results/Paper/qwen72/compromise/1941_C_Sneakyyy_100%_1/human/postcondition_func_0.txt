The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a string. It counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each string and prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the counts for all test cases have been printed.
