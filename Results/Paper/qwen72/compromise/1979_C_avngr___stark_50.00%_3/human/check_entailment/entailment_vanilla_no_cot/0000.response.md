Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the constraints and logic of the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**:
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all `k_i` values. This is incorrect because the product of all `k_i` values is not the correct way to determine the minimum bet amounts. Instead, the correct approach is to find a common multiple of the `k_i` values that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

2. **Incorrect Use of HCF (GCD)**:
   - The program calculates the HCF (GCD) of the `c` values, which are derived from the product `m` divided by each `k_i`. This is not necessary and does not help in finding a valid solution. The HCF calculation is not relevant to the problem's constraints.

3. **Incorrect Condition for No Solution**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the `c` values is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. This condition is not correct. The correct condition should be to check if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) and the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_bets(n, k):
    l = reduce(lcm, k)
    bets = [l // k[i] for i in range(n)]
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    if total_bet >= l:
        return -1
    return bets

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = find_bets(n, k)
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values. This ensures that the bets are in a common multiple, making it easier to check the total sum.

2. **Bets Calculation**:
   - The bets are calculated as `l // k[i]` for each `i`, where `l` is the LCM of the `k_i` values. This ensures that the return for each winning outcome is a multiple of the LCM.

3. **Sum Check**:
   - The program checks if the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

This corrected approach ensures that the program meets the problem's requirements and constraints.
