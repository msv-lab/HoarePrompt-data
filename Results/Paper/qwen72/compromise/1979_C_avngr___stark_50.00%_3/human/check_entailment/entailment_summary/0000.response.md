Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers `k_i` and then distributing the coins in a way that each bet is proportional to the product divided by the corresponding `k_i`. This ensures that the total bet is minimized while still allowing for a win in any outcome. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Calculation of `m`**: The program calculates `m` as the product of all `k_i`. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, potentially causing overflow issues. Instead, a more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values, which would ensure that the bets are still proportional but with smaller numbers.

2. **Calculation of `c`**: The program calculates each `c[i]` as `m / k[i]`. This is correct in terms of ensuring that the total bet is minimized, but it can be simplified by using the LCM approach.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses the GCD of the `c` list to reduce the bets to the smallest possible integers that still satisfy the conditions. This is a good approach, but it can be optimized by using the LCM of the `k_i` values directly.

4. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the bets `c` is less than `m / hcf`. This is incorrect because it should check if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the total amount received for any winning outcome, which is `c[i] * k[i]` for each `i`.

5. **Output**: If the sum of the bets is not less than the total amount received for any winning outcome, the program correctly outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

Given these points, the program is **incorrect** because it uses a product of all `k_i` values, which can lead to large numbers and potential overflow, and it incorrectly checks the sum of the bets against `m / hcf` instead of the total amount received for any winning outcome.

Correctness: **False**
