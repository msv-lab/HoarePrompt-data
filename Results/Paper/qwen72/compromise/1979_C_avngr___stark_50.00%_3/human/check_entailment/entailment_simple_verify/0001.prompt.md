You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2

    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to bet coins on `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - We need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the sum of all bets is less than the minimum of `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is `m`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c[i]` as `m / k[i]` for each outcome.
   - The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets `c` using the `func_1` function.
   - It scales down the bets by dividing each `c[i]` by the HCF.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The product `m` of all `k_i` values is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
   - By setting `c[i] = m / k[i]`, we ensure that `k_i * c[i] = m` for each `i`.
   - The HCF of the `c` values is used to scale down the bets to the smallest possible values that still satisfy the condition `k_i * c[i] = m`.
   - If the sum of the scaled bets is less than `m / hcf`, then the bets are valid because the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the sum of the scaled bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, then no valid solution exists, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program should handle the case where `n = 1` separately, as the product `m` would be `k[0]` and the bet `c[0]` would be `1`, which would always be valid.
   - The program should also handle the case where all `k_i` values are the same. In such cases, the sum of the bets will be `n * (m / k[0])`, which is always greater than or equal to `m / k[0]` if `n > 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program will correctly output a valid bet.
   - For `n > 1` and all `k_i` values being the same, the program will correctly output `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
