It seems there is a mismatch between the provided problem description and the function definition. The function definition `def func_1(numbers):` does not match the problem description, which involves betting on outcomes with multipliers. The correct function definition for the problem should be something like `def distribute_coins(t, n, k):`.

However, based on the problem description, here is the precondition:

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and k is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome.**
