The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element of the list `numbers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the next element in the list `numbers`. Since the loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next element will be the third element of the original list `numbers`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first and second elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`**
