Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome, `hcf` is the first element of the list `numbers`.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first and second elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first, second, and third elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 4 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first, second, third, and fourth elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth element of the list `numbers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
