Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last element of the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`. The variable `num` will be the last element of the list `numbers` that was processed in the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
