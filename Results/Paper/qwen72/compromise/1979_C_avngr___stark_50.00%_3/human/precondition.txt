t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the coins if the i-th outcome is the winning one. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
