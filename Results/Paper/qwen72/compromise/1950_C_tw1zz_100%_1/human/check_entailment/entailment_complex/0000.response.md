Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to convert a time given in 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" and converts it accordingly.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` time strings.
   - Each time string is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using the `split(':')` method.

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour part of the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from 01 to 11, the program correctly sets `h1` to the same value and `time` to "AM".
   - For hour 12, the program correctly sets `h1` to "12" and `time` to "PM".
   - For hours from 13 to 23, the program correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and `time` to "PM".
   - For hour 00, the program correctly sets `h1` to "12" and `time` to "AM".

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using the `print` function with `sep=''` to ensure no extra spaces are added.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as "00:00" and "12:00" correctly.
   - Leading zeros in the hour and minute parts are preserved in the output.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle invalid inputs, but the problem description guarantees that the input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.
- The program uses a large number of `if-elif` statements, which can be simplified using a more concise approach (e.g., using modulo arithmetic and conditional expressions).

### Conclusion:
Despite the verbose use of `if-elif` statements, the program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the results in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
