You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `t` (number of test cases) is no longer relevant. The values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned in each iteration and do not persist beyond the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have `n` islands, all initially connected by bridges.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys bridges.

2. **Initial Observations**:
   - If `k` is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is at least `n-1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Dominater**:
   - To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should focus on isolating island 1 as much as possible.
   - If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater can destroy `k` bridges, but not enough to isolate island 1 completely. Everule will still be able to visit all `n` islands because there will always be a path to any other island through the remaining bridges.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`.
     - If `k >= n-1`, it prints 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 0`, the output is 2 (Everule can visit both islands).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output is 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 1`, the output is 4 (Everule can still visit all islands).
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the output is 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the output is 5 (Everule can still visit all islands).
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the output is 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `k` is 0, `k` is at least `n-1`, and `k` is less than `n-1`.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
