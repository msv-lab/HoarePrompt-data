The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `t` (number of test cases) is no longer relevant. The values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned in each iteration and do not persist beyond the loop.
