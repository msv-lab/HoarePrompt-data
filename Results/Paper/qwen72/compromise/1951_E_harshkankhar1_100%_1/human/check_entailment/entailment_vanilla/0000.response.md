### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - The function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct.
   - If the string `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
     - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters in the string are the same), it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If `x` is found, it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If the substring starting from `x + 1` is a palindrome, it checks two conditions:
       - If `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, it is a palindrome. The function will correctly print "NO" because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same, the function will correctly print "NO" because any substring of such a string is a palindrome.
   - **Non-Palindromic String**: If `s` is already non-palindromic, the function will correctly print "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
   - **Mixed Characters**: If `s` contains mixed characters, the function will correctly find a partition where at least one substring is non-palindromic.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The function iterates through the string once to find the first non-matching character, which is \(O(n)\).
   - The palindrome check is also \(O(n)\).
   - Overall, the function is efficient and handles the constraints given in the problem.

### Correctness:
The provided program is **not entirely correct**. The logic in the `func_2` function is flawed in certain cases:

- **Case 1**: If the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same (e.g., "lllllllll"), the function correctly prints "NO".
- **Case 2**: If the string is a palindrome and there is a single different character (e.g., "abccba"), the function correctly finds a partition and prints "YES" with the partition.
- **Case 3**: If the string is a palindrome and the first non-matching character is at index 1 or `n // 2`, the function incorrectly prints "NO" in some cases where a valid partition exists.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- For the string "abccba", the function correctly prints:
  ```
  YES
  2
  a bccba
  ```
- For the string "uwuowouwu", the function incorrectly prints "NO" because it fails to find a valid partition when `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`. We can do this by checking if the substring `s[:x + 2]` is non-palindromic and then partitioning accordingly.

```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    x = -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if not func_1(s[x + 1:]):
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif not func_1(s[:x + 2]):
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage:
# t = int(input())
# for _ in range(t):
#     func_2()
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
