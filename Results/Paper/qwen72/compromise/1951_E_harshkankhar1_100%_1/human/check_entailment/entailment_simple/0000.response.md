### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindrome:**
   - The program starts by checking if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct because a non-palindromic string can be considered a valid partition of itself.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program then searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. This is done using a loop that iterates from the second character to the end of the string.
   - If such a character is found, the index `x` is set to the position of this character, and the loop breaks.

3. **Handling the Case Where All Characters Are the Same:**
   - If no such character is found (i.e., `x` remains -1), it means all characters in `s` are the same, making every possible substring a palindrome. In this case, the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If `x` is found, the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`, which is correct because both parts are non-palindromic.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because:
     - If `x` is 1, it means the first two characters are different, and the rest of the string is a palindrome. In this case, the partition `s[0]` and `s[1:]` would be valid.
     - If `x` is `n // 2`, it means the first half of the string is different from the second half, but the second half is a palindrome. In this case, the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` would still be valid.
   - If neither condition is true, the program prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`, which is correct because both parts are non-palindromic.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it has a logical error in the condition where it prints "NO" if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is too restrictive and can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the over-restrictive condition in the `else` block where it prints "NO" if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition should be removed to ensure the program always finds a valid partition when possible.
