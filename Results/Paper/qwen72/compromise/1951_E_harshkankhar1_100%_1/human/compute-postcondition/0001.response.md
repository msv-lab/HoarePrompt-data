Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6), `x` is -1.** 

The code snippet updates the value of `n` to be the length of the string `s`, and assigns `x` the value -1. The length of `s` remains within the specified range (1 to 10^6), and `x` is now a specific value, -1.
