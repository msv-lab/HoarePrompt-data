Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
   - The result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1.
   - `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.
   - The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

Output: **2**
