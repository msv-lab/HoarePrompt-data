Postcondition: ***`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1, and the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
