To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `x` is not -1, which means there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False`, which implies that `func_1(s[x + 1:])` must be `True`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('YES')` statement.

Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute because the conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
