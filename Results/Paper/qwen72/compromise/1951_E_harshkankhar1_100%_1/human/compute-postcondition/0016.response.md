Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the integer `2`.
- The initial state provides information about the string `s`, its length `n`, and the index `x`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False` is mentioned, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, or `x`.

Output: **2**
