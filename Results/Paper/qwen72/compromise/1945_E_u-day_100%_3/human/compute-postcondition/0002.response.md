Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` (as returned by `func_2()`), `pos` is -1.**

The value of `pos` is set to -1, indicating that the index of `k` in `arr` is now undefined or not found. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain as they were after being updated by `func_1()` and `func_2()`.
