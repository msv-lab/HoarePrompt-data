Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` such that 0 <= `pos` < `n`.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The other variables, `arr` and `pos`, remain unchanged, with `arr` still being a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `pos` still being the index of `k` in `arr` such that 0 <= `pos` < `n`.
