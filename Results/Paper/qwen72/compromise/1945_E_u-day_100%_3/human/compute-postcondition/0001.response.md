Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` (as returned by `func_2()`), and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` such that 0 <= `pos` < `n` (if `k` is present in the new `arr`), or `pos` is undefined (if `k` is not present in the new `arr`).**
