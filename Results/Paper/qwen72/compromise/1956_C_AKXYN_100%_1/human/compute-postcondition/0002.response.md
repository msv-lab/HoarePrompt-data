The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix, and the total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input. The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It processes these test cases and returns the appropriate output for each one, ensuring that the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.**
