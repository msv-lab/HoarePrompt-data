You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix a, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `res` for each test case will hold the value of the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value of `n << 1` will be printed alongside `res`. Additionally, for each test case, two lines are printed for each value of i from n to 1: the first line starts with '1' followed by the value of i and the range from 1 to n, and the second line starts with '2' followed by the value of i and the range from 1 to n. The matrix `mat` and the loop variable `_` are not relevant to the final output state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It processes these test cases and returns the appropriate output for each one, ensuring that the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
