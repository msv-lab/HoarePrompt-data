You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each specified by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a value `res` which is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and prints `res` alongside the value of `n << 1`. Additionally, for each value of `i` from `n` to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starts with '1' followed by `i` and the range from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with '2' followed by `i` and the range from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Objective**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The highest possible value for each element in the matrix is \( n \), and since there are \( n^2 \) elements, the maximum sum is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum**:
   - The program uses \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It then uses \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the same permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix will be set to \( n \) at least once, thus achieving the maximum sum.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the size of the matrix \( n \) for each test case.
   - **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row, which is not necessary for the final output but is a valid step.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation \( \text{res} \) is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^3 \), but the program calculates a different value using a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.
   - **Output**:
     - The program outputs the sum \( \text{res} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \), which is correct in terms of the number of operations.
     - The operations themselves are valid and correctly formatted, ensuring that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for performing the operations and the number of operations is correct.
   - However, the sum calculation is incorrect, which means the program does not correctly compute the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
