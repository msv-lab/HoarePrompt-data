Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Objective**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The maximum possible sum is \( n^3 \) because each element in the matrix can be set to \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements in total.
   - To achieve this, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is set to \( n \) at least once.

3. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum**:
   - The program uses \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It then uses \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the same permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix will be set to \( n \) at least once, thus achieving the maximum sum.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the size of the matrix \( n \) for each test case.
   - **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row. This is not necessary for the final output but is a valid step.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation \( \text{res} \) is incorrect. The program calculates \( \text{res} \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \), which does not match the problem's requirement of maximizing the sum to \( n^3 \).
   - **Output**:
     - The program outputs the sum \( \text{res} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \), which is correct in terms of the number of operations.
     - The operations themselves are valid and correctly formatted, ensuring that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for performing the operations and the number of operations is correct.
   - However, the sum calculation is incorrect, which means the program does not correctly compute the maximum sum.

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum, which should be \( n^3 \), but instead uses an incorrect formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
