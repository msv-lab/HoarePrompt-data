Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the satisfaction percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`). Specifically, the program incorrectly multiplies by 100 and uses `math.ceil`, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The requirement is to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which can be directly checked without converting to percentages.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely output a different value because of the incorrect percentage calculation.

In this case, the road should be laid after the second house. This ensures that:
- On the left side, there are 2 houses (10), and 1 out of 2 residents are satisfied (50%).
- On the right side, there are 2 houses (10), and 1 out of 2 residents are satisfied (50%).

However, the program's incorrect percentage calculation might lead it to choose a different position, making the program incorrect.
