Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must contain at least one more element, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged.
