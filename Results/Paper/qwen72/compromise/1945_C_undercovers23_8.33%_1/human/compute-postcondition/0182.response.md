The code snippet updates the value of `mini` by setting it to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`.
- `ele` is the first element in `lst`.
- All other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `pk`, `n`, `o`, `c1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`.**
