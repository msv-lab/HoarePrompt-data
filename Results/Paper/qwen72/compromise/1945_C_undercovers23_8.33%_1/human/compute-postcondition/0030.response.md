Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0; otherwise, `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1'. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The value of `zero_perc` is calculated based on the current values of `zero` and `i`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2.
- The value of `zero` depends on the character at `s[1]` (since `i` is 1).
- If `s[1]` is '0', `zero` is 2, so `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 2) = 100`.
- If `s[1]` is '1', `zero` is 0, so `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(0 * 100 / 2) = 0`.
- The value of `one` and `one_perc` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The list `lst` is not updated by this code snippet, so its value remains as specified in the initial state.
