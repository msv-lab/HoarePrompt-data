Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` contains `elem` and its length is 1 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` contains `n` and its length is 1, and `lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is not equal to `mini`, `final` remains unchanged.***
