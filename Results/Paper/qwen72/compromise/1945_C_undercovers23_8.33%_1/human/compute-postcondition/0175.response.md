Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 1))`, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.***
