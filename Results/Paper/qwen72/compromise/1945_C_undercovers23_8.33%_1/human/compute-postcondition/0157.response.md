Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 0, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`. Additionally, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not '0'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `one` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
