The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 and `one` is 0 if `s[2]` is '0'; otherwise, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1 if `s[2]` is '0', or `zero` is 1 and `one` is 2 if `s[2]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(3 * 100 / (i + 1))` or `math.ceil(2 * 100 / (i + 1))` or `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50% and `one_perc` is at least 50%, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
