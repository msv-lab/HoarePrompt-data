Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list containing all indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50% during the iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop has completed all its iterations is as follows:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is still greater than 1.
- The variable `s` is still the input string.
- The variable `pk` is still `n // 2`.
- The variable `sl` is still a list of characters from the input string `s`.
- The variable `o` is still the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`.
- The variable `z` is still the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`.
- The variable `mini` remains 100,000,000.
- The variable `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating the loop has run through all but the last element of the string `s`.
- The variable `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration.
- The variable `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration.
- The variable `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the last iteration, calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`.
- The variable `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's remaining from the next index to the end of the string, calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- The variable `lst` contains all indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50% during the iterations.
