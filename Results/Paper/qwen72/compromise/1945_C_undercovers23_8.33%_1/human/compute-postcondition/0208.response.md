Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains `[0]` and has a length of 1. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains the single element `n`, sorted in ascending order, and has a length of 1. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`) remains unchanged, except `c1` which is now equal to `o * 100 // n`.***
