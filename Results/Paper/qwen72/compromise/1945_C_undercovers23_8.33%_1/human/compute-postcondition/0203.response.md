Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order, but the length of `final` is 0. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`) remains unchanged, except `c1` which is now equal to `o * 100 // n`. Additionally, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
