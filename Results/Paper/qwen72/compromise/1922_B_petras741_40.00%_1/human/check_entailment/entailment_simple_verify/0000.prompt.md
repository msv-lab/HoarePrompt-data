You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: The variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `buffer` remains an empty list. The loop processes each test case, reading `n` and a list of integers `w`, and prints the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length if `n` is at least 3. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The internal variables `q`, `eta`, `rho`, and `res` are recalculated for each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the handling of the `eta` list and the calculation of the number of ways to form a triangle. Specifically, the program incorrectly breaks the loop when `j > 1000`, which can lead to incorrect results if the number of unique stick lengths exceeds 1000. This is not a valid constraint based on the problem description, and it can cause the program to miss counting valid triangles.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1001
1 1 1 ... 1 2 2 2 ... 2 3 3 3 ... 3
```
Here, there are 1001 sticks, with 334 sticks of length \(2^1\), 334 sticks of length \(2^2\), and 333 sticks of length \(2^3\). The program will break the loop after processing the first 1000 unique stick lengths, leading to an incorrect result. The correct result should count all possible triangles formed by these sticks, but the program will not do so due to the premature break.
