The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `stick_exponents`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `stick_exponents` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. Each inner list has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each integer `a_i` in the inner list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `stick_exponents`. The result for each test case is determined based on the exponents of the stick lengths provided in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `stick_exponents`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `stick_exponents` and is determined based on the exponents of the stick lengths provided in the inner lists.**
