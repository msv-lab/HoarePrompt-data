Output State: **The variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `buffer` remains an empty list. The loop processes each test case, reading `n` and a list of integers `w`, and prints the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length if `n` is at least 3. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The internal variables `q`, `eta`, `rho`, and `res` are recalculated for each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.**
