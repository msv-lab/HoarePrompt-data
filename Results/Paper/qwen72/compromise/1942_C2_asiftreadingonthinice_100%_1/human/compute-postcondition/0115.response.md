The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by 1.
