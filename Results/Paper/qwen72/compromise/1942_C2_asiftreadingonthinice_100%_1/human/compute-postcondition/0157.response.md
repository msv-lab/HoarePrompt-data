Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` for each element `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is incremented by the sum of all elements in `tmp`, and `y` is updated to `y - (sum of (i - 1) for each i in tmp)`. If at any point `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop breaks, and `y` is set to 0. `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `ans` starts with the initial value of `x + y - 2` and is incremented by the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2.
- If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` for each element `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is further incremented by the sum of all elements in `tmp`, and `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for each `i` in `tmp`.
- If at any point `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop stops, and `y` is set to 0.
- The variable `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed.
- The list `tmp` remains a sorted list of integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2, and if applicable, `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.
