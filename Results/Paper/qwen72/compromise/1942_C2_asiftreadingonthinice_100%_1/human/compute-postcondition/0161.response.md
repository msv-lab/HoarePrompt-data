The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` vertices. The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the list of vertices should contain `x` distinct integers from 1 to n.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct vertices. It returns a result based on these parameters, ensuring that `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `n` is between 4 and 10^9, `x` is between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 · 10^5, `y` is between 0 and `n - x`, and the list of vertices contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
