Postcondition: ***`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`, `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` is set to 0, `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
