Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order as the loop does not modify its elements.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` starts with the value `x + y - 2`. For each iteration of the loop, if the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. This means `ans` will be the initial value plus the count of such differences.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `len(a) - 1` after the loop has completed all iterations. This is because the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (inclusive of `1` and exclusive of `len(a)`).
- **`tmp`**: The list `tmp` will contain the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all indices `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If no such differences exist, `tmp` will remain an empty list.
