The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again with the next element in `tmp`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must still contain at least one element (after the current `i` is processed).

State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` is set to 0, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` must contain at least one more element.**
