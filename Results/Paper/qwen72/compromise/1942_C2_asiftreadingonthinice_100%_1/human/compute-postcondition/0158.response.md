Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the final value of `y` after the loop, `y` is 0, `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.**
