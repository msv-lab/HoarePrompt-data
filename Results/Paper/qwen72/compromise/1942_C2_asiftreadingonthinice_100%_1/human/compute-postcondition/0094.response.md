The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `tmp` is a non-empty list containing specific values based on the conditions described. The variable `i` is the current element being processed in `tmp`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tmp` must still be non-empty, and `i` must be the next element in `tmp`.

State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `i` is the next element in `tmp`**.
