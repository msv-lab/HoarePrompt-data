Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending or descending order.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The current program does not perform these steps. It only finds the maximum and minimum values and computes their difference, which does not align with the problem's requirements. The examples provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrate this issue.

Final: **False**
