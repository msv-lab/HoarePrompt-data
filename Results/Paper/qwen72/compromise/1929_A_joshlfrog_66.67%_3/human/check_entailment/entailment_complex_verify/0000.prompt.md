You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the last input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the last `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the last `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` representing the length of an array, followed by `l` integers that form the array. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints this difference. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `t` (the number of test cases), `e` (the index of the last processed test case, which is `t-1`), `l` (the length of the last array), `i` (the index of the last element processed in the last array, which is `l-1`), `nums` (the last array of integers provided by the user), `x` (the maximum value in the last `nums`), and `y` (the minimum value in the last `nums`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearranging to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2` because the array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program will output `2` because it calculates `3 - 1 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.

Another example:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because the array can be rearranged to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty is `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`. However, the program will output `1` because it calculates `4 - 3 = 1`, which is again coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.

The program fails to handle the requirement of rearranging the array to maximize the beauty, and it does not correctly compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, it is incorrect.
