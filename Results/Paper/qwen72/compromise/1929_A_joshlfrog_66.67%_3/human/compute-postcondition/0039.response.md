Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. `y` is updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000.**
