The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `l`, so `l` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` (if `nums[0]` is greater than 0), `i` is 1, `y` is updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than the initial value of `y` (100000000), otherwise `y` remains 100000000.**
