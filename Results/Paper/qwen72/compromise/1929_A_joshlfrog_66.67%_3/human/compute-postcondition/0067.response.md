Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `nums[0]` is not less than `y`, `y` is 100000000; otherwise, `y` is `nums[0]`. `x` is `nums[i]` (i.e., `nums[2]`). If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, `y` is updated to `nums[i]`, and `x` is the greater of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0.**
