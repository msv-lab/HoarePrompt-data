Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` (if `nums[0]` is greater than 0), `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is less than the initial value of `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.***
