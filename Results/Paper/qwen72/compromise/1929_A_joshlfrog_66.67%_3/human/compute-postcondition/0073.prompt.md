Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
