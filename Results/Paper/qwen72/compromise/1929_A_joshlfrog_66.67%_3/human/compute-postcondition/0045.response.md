Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `x` is the maximum of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` if any of these values are greater than 0, `y` is `nums[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[2]` to `y`.
- Since `i` is 2, `y` now holds the value of the third element in the list `nums`.
- The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The initial condition for `y` (whether it was 100000000 or `nums[0]`) is no longer relevant as `y` is now explicitly set to `nums[2]`.
