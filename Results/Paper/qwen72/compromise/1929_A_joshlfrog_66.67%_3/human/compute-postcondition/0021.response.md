Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is equal to `nums[2]`.** 

The value of `y` is set to the third element of the list `nums` (since `i` is 2, and Python uses 0-based indexing). The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `x` is not affected by this code snippet, so `x` retains its original value.
