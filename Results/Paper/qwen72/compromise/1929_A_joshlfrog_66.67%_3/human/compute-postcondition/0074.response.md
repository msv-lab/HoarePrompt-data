Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500), `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100), and `a` (a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n). The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return values are not provided in the given information.**
