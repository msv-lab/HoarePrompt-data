Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
8
```

The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws. The correct logic should be to first check if the sum of the scores is even (which it does correctly). Then, it should calculate the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. The correct approach is to calculate the maximum number of draws as the minimum of the total points divided by 2 and the sum of the two smallest scores. The program's logic for calculating the number of draws is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
