Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem, but it contains some logical errors that can lead to incorrect outputs. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either 2 for a win or 2 for a draw).

2. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2`. However, the logic used to determine the number of draws is flawed. The program uses a binary search-like approach to find a value `cur` that satisfies certain conditions, but this approach is not correct for the problem at hand.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- The total number of points must be even.
- The maximum number of draws is the maximum number of points that can be distributed as draws without violating the constraints that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are non-decreasing and the total points are even.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = (total_points // 2) - (p3 - p2)
        if max_draws < 0 or max_draws > p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Points Check**: If the total points are odd, print `-1`.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is calculated as `(total_points // 2) - (p3 - p2)`. This formula ensures that the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of the scores.
- **Validation**: If the calculated `max_draws` is negative or greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, print `-1`. Otherwise, print `max_draws`.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
