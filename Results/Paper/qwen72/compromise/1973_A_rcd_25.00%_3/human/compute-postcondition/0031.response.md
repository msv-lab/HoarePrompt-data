The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `high + 1` or the value of `low` where the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is never true, the loop does not execute, and the output is `p3`. If the loop condition is true and the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop condition is true but the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is never met, the loop completes, and the output is `p3`.**
