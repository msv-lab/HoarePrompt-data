The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `high >= cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, and `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`, and `high` is at least `low + 1`, the loop can execute again if `cur` is `low + 1` or `low + 2` and `high` is at least `low + 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is at least `low + 2` and `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`. `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.**
