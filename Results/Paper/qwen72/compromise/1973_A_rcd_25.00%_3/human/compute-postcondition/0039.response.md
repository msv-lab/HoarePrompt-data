To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` in the loop head condition `high >= cur`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `cur` is equal to `low`

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Since `cur` is set to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is guaranteed that `high` will be greater than or equal to `low` (and thus `cur`).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
