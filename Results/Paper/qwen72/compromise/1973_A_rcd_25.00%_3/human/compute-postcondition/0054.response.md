Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`, `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is `low + 3`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so if `cur` was initially `low + 2`, it is now `low + 3`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
