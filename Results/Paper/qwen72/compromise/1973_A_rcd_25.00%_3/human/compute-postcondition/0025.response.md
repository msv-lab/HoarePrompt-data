Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is given).
2. `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the print statement, it is given).
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
6. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
7. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
8. `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`.
9. `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd:**
   - This means that the sum of `p1 + p2 + p3` is an odd number. This implies that one of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` is odd, and the other two are either both even or both odd.

2. **`p3` is less than `p1 + p2`:**
   - This means `p3 < p1 + p2`.

3. **`low` and `high` calculations:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - Since `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`, this implies that the difference between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` is at least 2.

4. **`cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`:**
   - `cur` is one of the two values: `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

### Expression to Print:
```
p1 - cur + p3
```

### Possible Values of `cur`:
- If `cur = low + 1`, then the expression becomes:
  \[
  p1 - (low + 1) + p3 = p1 - low - 1 + p3
  \]
- If `cur = low + 2`, then the expression becomes:
  \[
  p1 - (low + 2) + p3 = p1 - low - 2 + p3
  \]

### Simplifying the Expression:
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- Let's consider the two cases for `low`:
  - If `low = p3 - p1`, then:
    - For `cur = low + 1`:
      \[
      p1 - (p3 - p1 + 1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 - 1 + p3 = 2p1 - 1
      \]
    - For `cur = low + 2`:
      \[
      p1 - (p3 - p1 + 2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 - 2 + p3 = 2p1 - 2
      \]
  - If `low = p3 - p2`, then:
    - For `cur = low + 1`:
      \[
      p1 - (p3 - p2 + 1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 - 1 + p3 = p1 + p2 - 1
      \]
    - For `cur = low + 2`:
      \[
      p1 - (p3 - p2 + 2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 - 2 + p3 = p1 + p2 - 2
      \]

### Conclusion:
- The value printed will be either `2p1 - 1`, `2p1 - 2`, `p1 + p2 - 1`, or `p1 + p2 - 2` depending on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **either 2p1 - 1, 2p1 - 2, p1 + p2 - 1, or p1 + p2 - 2 (where p1, p2, and p3 are input integers, and the exact value depends on the specific values of p1, p2, and p3)**
