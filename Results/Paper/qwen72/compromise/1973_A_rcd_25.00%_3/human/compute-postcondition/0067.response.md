Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`, and the current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.**
