To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` since they are the only ones involved in the loop condition `high >= cur`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers (not directly relevant to the loop condition, but they influence `low` and `high`)
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `cur` is equal to `low`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
- `cur` is initially set to `low`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`.

Given the definitions:
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Since `low` is the minimum and `high` is the maximum of the same two values, `high` will always be greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, the loop condition `high >= cur` will always be true on the first iteration because `cur` is set to `low`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`**
