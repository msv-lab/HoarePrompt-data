#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is a discrepancy.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 != 0` holds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". After processing all test cases, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case, and the variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
