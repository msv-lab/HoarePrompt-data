### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())` and then iterates over `range(t)`. This part is correct.
   - Inside the loop, the function reads a string `s` which contains two integers `a` and `b`. The function then splits the string and converts the parts to integers. This is also correct.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".
   - This logic is based on the observation that if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally. This is because Alice can always force Bob into a position where he has to make the last move, and since the sum is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the sum is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. This is because Alice can always force Bob into a position where Bob has to make the last move, and since the sum is odd, Alice will always be the one to make the last move.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case. However, it only prints the result for the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only prints the result for the last test case, rather than printing the result for each test case as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
