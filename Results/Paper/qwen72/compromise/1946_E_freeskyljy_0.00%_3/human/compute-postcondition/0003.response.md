Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each case in `cases` is a tuple (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `m_1` and `m_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n, `p` is a list of `m_1` integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and `s` is a list of `m_2` integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers provided by the user input, where `N` is the first integer, `M1` is the second integer, and `M2` is the third integer. `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input. The last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`.**
