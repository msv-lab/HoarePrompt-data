The only objects in the loop head are variables `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `n`. The loop increments `k` by 2, so at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is 4. If the fifth character of `b` (i.e., `b[k]`) is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
