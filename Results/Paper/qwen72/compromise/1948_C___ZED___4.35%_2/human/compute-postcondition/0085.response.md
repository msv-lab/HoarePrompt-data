Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is True, then `k` is not `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` remains True because there exists at least one character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` that is not `>`. If `no_path` is False, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` remains False if any character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` is not `>`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.***
