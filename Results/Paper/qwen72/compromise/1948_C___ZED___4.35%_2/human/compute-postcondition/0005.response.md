The `print('NO')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'NO'` to the console. The precondition provides information about the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output of the print statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **NO**
