Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two lists of strings row1 and row2 (each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>'). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not `>`, the state remains unchanged. If the second-to-last character of `b` is `>`, and `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, `k` is the last odd index less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index from 1 to `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. Additionally, if the `else` part is executed, `no_path` is set to False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not `>`, then `k` is the last even index less than `n` if the second-to-last character of the new `b` is `>` and `n` is greater than 1, or the last odd index less than `n` if `no_path` is initially False and `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions described. If the second-to-last character of `b` is `>`, then: if `n` is 1, `k` is the last even index less than `n` if the second-to-last character of the new `b` is `>` and `n` is greater than 1, or the last odd index less than `n` if `no_path` is initially False and `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions described; if `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is True, then `k` is not `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` remains True because there exists at least one character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` that is not `>`. If `no_path` is False, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` remains False if any character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` is not `>`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, if all characters at odd indices in `a` (from 1 to `k`) are '>', `no_path` becomes True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
