Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is the last even index less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is True if there exists at least one character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` that is not `>`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `no_path`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is a constant string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
