Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `k` is determined based on the following conditions:
  - If the second-to-last character of the new `b` is `>` and `n` is greater than 1, then `k` is the last even index less than `n`.
  - If `no_path` is initially False and `n` is greater than 1, then `k` is the last odd index less than `n`.
- `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions described.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are input strings.
   - `k` is determined based on the conditions involving `b` and `no_path`.
   - `no_path` is a boolean variable that can be either True or False.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
