The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `k`.

Based on the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a new input string
- `b` is a new input string
- `k` is 1
- `no_path` is True

The value of `k` is explicitly given as 1. Therefore, the `print` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
