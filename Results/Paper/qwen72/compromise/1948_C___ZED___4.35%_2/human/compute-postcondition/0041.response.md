Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>', `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, then `k` is the last odd index less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index from 1 to `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. Additionally, `no_path` is False.***
