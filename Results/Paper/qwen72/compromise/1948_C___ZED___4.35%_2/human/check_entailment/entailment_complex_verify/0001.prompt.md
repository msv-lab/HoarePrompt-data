You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two lists of strings row1 and row2 (each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>'). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 1, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, if all characters at odd indices in `a` (from 1 to `k`) are '>', `no_path` becomes True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes no parameters but reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the characters in `a` and `b` can be paired such that each '<' in `a` is paired with a '>' in `b` and vice versa. It prints "YES" if the pairing is possible, and "NO" otherwise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a "YES" or "NO" result has been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function first checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, and the function prints 'NO'.
   - This check is valid because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot move from the second-to-last cell to the last cell in the second row, which is necessary for reaching the target cell (2, n).

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. If it is, the function prints 'YES'.
   - This check is incorrect because the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, and this condition will never be true.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n).
   - It initializes a variable `no_path` to `True` and iterates over the cells in the second row with even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-2) to check if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it iterates over the cells in the first row with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., n-3) to check if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The function's logic for checking the path is flawed. It assumes that the robot can only move to the right in the second row and to the right in the first row. However, the robot can also move up and down, and the arrows in the cells can change the direction of the robot's movement.
   - The function does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, which is crucial for determining if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, and it contains an unnecessary and incorrect special case for `n == 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
