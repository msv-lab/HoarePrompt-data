Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program incorrectly handles the case when `n == 1`. According to the problem constraints, `n` is always at least 2, so this check is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior if it is ever executed.

2. **Path Checking Logic**: The logic for checking if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` is flawed. The program checks if `b[-2]` is not `'> '` and immediately prints `NO` if this condition is met. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. The robot can still reach the target cell even if `b[-2]` is not `'> '`, depending on the configuration of the arrows in the grid.

3. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loops that check for the presence of `'> '` in the strings `a` and `b` are not correctly formulated. The program checks every second character in `b` and `a` starting from index 0 and 1, respectively, but this does not guarantee that the robot can move to the target cell. The robot can move in a more complex pattern, and these checks are too simplistic.

4. **Redundant `no_path` Variable**: The `no_path` variable is used in a way that does not effectively capture the robot's ability to reach the target cell. The program sets `no_path` to `True` and then to `False` based on the presence of `'> '` in certain positions, but this does not consider the full path the robot can take.

5. **Unnecessary Print Statements**: The program includes a `print(k)` statement inside the loop, which is not required for the solution and can clutter the output.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Initialize the robot's position
        row, col = 1, 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        while col < n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col - 1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 2
            else:  # row == 2
                if b[col - 1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 1
        
        # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
can_reach_target()
```

This corrected program simulates the robot's movement step by step and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. It correctly handles the problem constraints and edge cases.
