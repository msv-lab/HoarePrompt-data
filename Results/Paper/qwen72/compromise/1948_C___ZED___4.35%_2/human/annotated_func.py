#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two lists of strings row1 and row2 (each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>'). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 1, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, if all characters at odd indices in `a` (from 1 to `k`) are '>', `no_path` becomes True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes no parameters but reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the characters in `a` and `b` can be paired such that each '<' in `a` is paired with a '>' in `b` and vice versa. It prints "YES" if the pairing is possible, and "NO" otherwise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a "YES" or "NO" result has been printed.
