Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list (`n`), `n` is equal to the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `total % n == 0`, and `curr` is 0.** 

The code initializes `curr` to 0, but does not change the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain valid, and `curr` is now 0.
