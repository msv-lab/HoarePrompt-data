Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean of the list, calculated as the sum of the integers divided by the length of the list, ever becomes negative. If at any point the cumulative deviation is negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the cumulative deviation never becomes negative, the function returns 'YES'. The list `nums` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
