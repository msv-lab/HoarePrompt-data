### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates the length of the list `n` and the total sum of the list `total`.
   - It checks if `total` is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean value `mean` which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean value.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is a container that cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index, so the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and calls the function `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the mean value and checks if it is possible to balance the containers by pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers.
   - The logic of the function ensures that if the cumulative difference `curr` ever becomes negative, it is impossible to balance the containers, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the cumulative difference `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that the containers can be balanced, and the function returns 'YES'.
   - The program's output matches the expected output for the given example.
