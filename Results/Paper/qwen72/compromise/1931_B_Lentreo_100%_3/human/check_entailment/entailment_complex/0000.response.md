Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key insight is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, then it is possible to equalize the water in all containers if and only if the cumulative deviation from the mean never becomes negative during the process of equalizing the water.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. Therefore, `total % n == 0` will always be true, and the function will never return 'NO' at this point.

2. **Mean Calculation**: The function calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after equalization, which is `total // n`.

3. **Cumulative Deviation Check**: The function then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative deviation `curr`. For each container, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the water in the containers up to that point is less than the required mean, and it is impossible to equalize the water using the given operation (since water can only be poured from a higher-indexed container to a lower-indexed container).

4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water.

The function correctly implements the logic for determining if the water can be equalized. The cumulative deviation check ensures that at no point do the containers have less water than required to reach the mean, which is a necessary condition for the equalization to be possible.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
