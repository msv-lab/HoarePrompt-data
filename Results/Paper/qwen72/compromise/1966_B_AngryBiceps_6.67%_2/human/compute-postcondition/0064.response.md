Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list containing two user input strings; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a[0]`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]`; `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` adds a new user input string to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contained one user input string, and now it contains two. The variables `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
