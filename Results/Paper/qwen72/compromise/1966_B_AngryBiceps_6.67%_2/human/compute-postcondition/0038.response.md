Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two more elements, the first being the user input from the initial state and the second being a new user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the initial user input and the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the initial user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` adds the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the initial user input and the second element is a new user input.
- Therefore, `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of the second user input.
- `first_row` is updated to include this first character.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
