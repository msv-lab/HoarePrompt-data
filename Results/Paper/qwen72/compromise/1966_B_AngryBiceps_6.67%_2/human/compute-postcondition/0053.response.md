Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list with `n` elements, each element being a user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of each user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of each user input. If the first element of `a` consists of a single unique character and is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.***
