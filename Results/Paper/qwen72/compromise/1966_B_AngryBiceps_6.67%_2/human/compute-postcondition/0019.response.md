Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0**: This means `n` is a positive integer.
2. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is one less than `n`.
3. **`_` is 0**: This is just a placeholder variable with the value 0.
4. **`a` is a list containing `n` user inputs**: This means `a` is a list where each element is a user input.
5. **`first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together**: This means `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in `a`.
6. **`last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together**: This means `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in `a`.
7. **The length of the set of the first element in `a` is 1 (meaning the first element is composed of a single unique character)**: This means the first element of `a` is a string with only one unique character.
8. **The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`**: This means the first string in `a` is different from the last string in `a`.

Given these conditions, the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
