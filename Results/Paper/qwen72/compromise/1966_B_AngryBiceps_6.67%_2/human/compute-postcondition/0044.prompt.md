Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, and the condition is not met.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two more elements, the first being the user input from the initial state and the second being a new user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the initial user input and the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the initial user input and the last character of the second user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with three elements, the first being the initial user input, the second being a new user input, and the third being another new user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the initial user input, the first character of the second user input, and the first character of the third user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the initial user input, the last character of the second user input, and the last character of the third user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
