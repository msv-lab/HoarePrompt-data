Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing one user input string; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`; `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Initially, `last_row` is an empty string, so after the execution, `last_row` will contain the last character of the string in `a`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
