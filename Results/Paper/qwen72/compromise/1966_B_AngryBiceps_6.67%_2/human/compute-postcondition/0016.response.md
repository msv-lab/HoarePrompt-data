Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing three user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of the first user input concatenated with the first character of the second user input and the first character of the third user input, `last_row` is the last character of the first user input concatenated with the last character of the second user input and the last character of the third user input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`.
- Since `a` is a list containing three user inputs, `a[-1]` refers to the third user input.
- The last character of the third user input is `a[-1][-1]`.
- The previous value of `last_row` was the last character of the first user input concatenated with the last character of the second user input.
- After executing the code, `last_row` now includes the last character of the third user input as well.
