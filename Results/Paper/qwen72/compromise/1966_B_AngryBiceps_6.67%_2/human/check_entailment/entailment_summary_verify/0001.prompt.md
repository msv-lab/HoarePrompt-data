You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row.
2. If the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column.
If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the grid meets the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores each row in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.
   - The purpose of these strings is to check the consistency of the first and last characters across all rows.

3. **Conditions for Impossibility:**
   - The program checks if the first row `a[0]` is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1`).
     - If the first row is entirely one color and the last row `a[-1]` is not the same color, it prints "NO".
   - The program also checks if the `first_row` is entirely one color.
     - If the `first_row` is entirely one color and the `last_row` is not the same color, it prints "NO".

4. **Conditions for Possibility:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **First Condition:**
  - If the first row is entirely one color and the last row is not the same color, it is impossible to make the entire grid one color because the first row and the last row will always have different colors, and no operation can change this.
- **Second Condition:**
  - If the `first_row` is entirely one color and the `last_row` is not the same color, it is also impossible to make the entire grid one color because the first and last columns will always have different colors, and no operation can change this.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Row or Single Column:**
  - If the grid has only one row or one column, the program will correctly determine that it is possible to make the entire grid one color if it is already one color.
- **Already Uniform:**
  - If the grid is already uniform (all squares are the same color), the program will correctly print "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid one color and prints "NO" in those cases. It also correctly prints "YES" when the grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
