Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns to determine if the grid can be made uniform. This approach fails in cases where the grid can be made uniform but does not meet the specific conditions checked by the program.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```
The program will output "NO" because the first and last rows are not the same, and the first and last columns are not the same. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
