The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, computes `ans` as the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, then prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input for each test case.
