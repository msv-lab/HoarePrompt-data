You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, computes `ans` as the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, then prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all the potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case 1: \( a \ge b \)**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price `a` will always yield a higher or equal profit compared to the modified price.

3. **Case 2: \( a < b \)**:
   - The program determines the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` is within the valid range \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b)\).
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{ans} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\). This formula correctly calculates the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices.
   - The profit from the remaining \(n - k\) buns is calculated as \((n - k) \times a\).
   - The total profit is then the sum of the profits from the first `k` buns and the remaining \(n - k\) buns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b` is 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` is 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) and `a` and `b` are also large (up to \(10^9\)).

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description for every input. Therefore, the program is correct.
