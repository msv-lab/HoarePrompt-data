Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` using the condition `if a >= b:`. If this condition is true, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would not be beneficial. The program correctly calculates and prints `n * a` in this case.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation**: If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is correct because:
   - `b - a + 1` ensures that the modified price is always greater than or equal to `a` for the first `k` buns.
   - `min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then the sum of these two parts, which is correctly printed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `a >= b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the correct profit for each test case, as verified by the example test cases provided in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
