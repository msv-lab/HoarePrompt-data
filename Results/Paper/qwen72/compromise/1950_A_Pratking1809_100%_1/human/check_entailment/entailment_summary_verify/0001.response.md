Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `q`, using `q = int(input())`. This is consistent with the problem description, which specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate `q` times, which is correct. This ensures that the program processes each test case exactly once.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it converts the input string into three integers, which is consistent with the problem description that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NONE'. This is the correct behavior for handling cases that do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions checked. This matches the expected output format as described in the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`) or when the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., `4 1 7`). In these cases, it prints 'NONE', which is the expected output.

7. **Function Summary**: The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions. The summary also notes that the function does not return any value, which is consistent with the program's implementation.

Given the above reasoning and the function summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and handles all specified cases.

Final: **True**
