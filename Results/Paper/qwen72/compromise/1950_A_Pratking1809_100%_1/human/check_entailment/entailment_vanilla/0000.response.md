Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `q`, which is an integer. This is done using `q = int(input())`. This is correct as per the problem description, which states that the first line contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, where `q` is the number of test cases. This is implemented using `for i in range(q):`. This is correct because it ensures that the program processes each test case exactly once.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is done using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it converts the input string into three integers, which is consistent with the problem description that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NONE'.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions checked. This matches the expected output format as described in the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`) or when the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., `4 1 7`). In these cases, it correctly prints 'NONE'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and handles all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
