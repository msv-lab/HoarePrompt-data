The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, and for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. For each test case, it prints the pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and if `n` is 3, it prints (2, 3). If `n` is greater than 3, it prints (2, 4) followed by pairs (j, j) for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` inclusive. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding output has been printed for each `n` input.
