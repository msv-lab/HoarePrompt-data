Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is a simple string literal `print('1 2')`.
- The string `'1 2'` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'1 2'`, regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

### Output:
Output: **1 2**
