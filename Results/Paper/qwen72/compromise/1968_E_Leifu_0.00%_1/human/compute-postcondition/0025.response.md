The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` at 4 and continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5**
