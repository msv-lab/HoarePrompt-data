Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'1 1'`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, and `j` (if it is set) do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the `print` statement is not using any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'1 1'` regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

Output: **1 1**
