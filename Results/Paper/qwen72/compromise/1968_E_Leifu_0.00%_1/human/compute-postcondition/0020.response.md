Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
   - If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('1 2')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'1 2'`.
   - The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, and `j` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and the values of the variables.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
