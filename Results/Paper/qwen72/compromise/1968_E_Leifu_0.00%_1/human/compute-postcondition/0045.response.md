Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`, and `i` is `t - 1`. If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`. If `n` is less than 3, `j` is set to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is an input integer**: This remains true because `n` is read from the input in each iteration of the loop.
- **`t` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`**: The loop runs `t` times, so by the time it finishes, `t` must be at least as large as its initial value.
- **`i` is `t - 1`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `t` iterations, `i` will be `t - 1`.
- **If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables**: If `n` is 3, the loop only prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3' without modifying any variables.
- **If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`**: If `n` is 4 or more, the inner loop runs from 4 to `n`, and the last value of `j` will be `n`.
- **If `n` is less than 3, `j` is set to `n`**: If `n` is less than 3, the inner loop does not run, and `j` will not be modified. However, the loop still prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4', and `j` will be set to `n` if it is less than 3.
