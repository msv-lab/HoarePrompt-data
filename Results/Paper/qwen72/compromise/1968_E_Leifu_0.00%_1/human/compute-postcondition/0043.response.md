Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `j` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value of `n`, and `n` will remain unchanged from its initial value. The loop will have printed each integer from 4 to `n` (inclusive) twice, once as the first part of the string and once as the second part. The condition for the loop to execute at least once is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and this condition must hold true for the loop to complete all iterations.
