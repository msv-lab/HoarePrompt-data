Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
- If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 3')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'2 3'`.
- The string `'2 3'` is a fixed value and does not depend on any variables or conditions in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be the same, regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'2 3'`.

Output: **2 3**
