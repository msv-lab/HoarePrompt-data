Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
   - If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('1 1')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a fixed string `'1 1'`.
   - The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string being printed is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'1 1'` regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

Output: **1 1**
