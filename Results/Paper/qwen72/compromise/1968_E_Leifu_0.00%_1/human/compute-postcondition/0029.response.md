Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value of `n`. The loop starts with `j` set to 4 and increments `j` by 1 for each iteration until `j` reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, when the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n`. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains unchanged, as this is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
