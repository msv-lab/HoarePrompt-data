### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them to 0-based indexing. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This list is used to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited by setting `vis[s]` to 1.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`. This step is intended to consider the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Score Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The program correctly handles cycles by using the `vis` list to mark visited positions. This ensures that the loop does not run indefinitely.
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation within the loop is correct. It considers the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns and updates the current score accordingly.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when the starting positions are the same.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only traverses each position in the permutation once per test case.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Annotation Accuracy:**
  - The annotations provided are accurate and correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
  - The function `func_1` is correctly described as calculating the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem. It correctly handles the input, performs the necessary score calculations, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Correctness:
The original assessment was accurate. The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
