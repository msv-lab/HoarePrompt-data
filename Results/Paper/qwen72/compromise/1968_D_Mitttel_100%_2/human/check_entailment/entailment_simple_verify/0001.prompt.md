You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the following changes have occurred: `s` is now the position in `p` that was last visited before the loop terminated. `k` is 0 or the number of remaining turns that were not executed because the position `s` was already visited. `mx` is the maximum value calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered. `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` that were visited during the loop. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where each visited position in `p` has a value of 1, and all other positions remain 0. The lists `a` and `p` remain unchanged, and `n` is still the length of the list `p`.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value `mx` calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them to 0-based indexing. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This list is used to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited by setting `vis[s]` to 1.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`. This step is intended to consider the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Score Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The program correctly handles cycles by using the `vis` list to mark visited positions. This ensures that the loop does not run indefinitely.
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation within the loop is correct. It considers the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns and updates the current score accordingly.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when the starting positions are the same.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only traverses each position in the permutation once per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem. It correctly handles the input, performs the necessary score calculations, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
