### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` for each test case.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` and running for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score encountered.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current cumulative score.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will be used to mark visited positions.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`. This is a crucial step because it considers the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when either `k` reaches 0 or the current position `s` has been visited before. This ensures that the player does not get stuck in an infinite loop if there is a cycle in the permutation.

5. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares their final scores.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a single player, considering the possibility of cycles in the permutation and the maximum score achievable.
- The comparison and output logic for determining the winner is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
