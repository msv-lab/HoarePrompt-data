Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case. It also adjusts the starting positions by subtracting 1 to align with zero-indexed arrays.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `mx` to 0, `cur` to 0, and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
   - **Loop**: The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - **Update**: Inside the loop, it marks the current position `s` as visited, updates the maximum score `mx` based on the current cumulative score `cur` and the remaining turns `k`, adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`, decrements `k`, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Output**: After computing the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program correctly compares the scores and prints the result based on who has the higher score or if it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the starting positions are the same.
   - It also handles the case where the permutation forms cycles, ensuring that the loop terminates when a position is revisited.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The function `func_1` ensures that each position is visited at most once, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The use of a `vis` list to track visited positions prevents infinite loops in cyclic permutations.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the game by following the rules: adding the score at the current position and then either staying or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The maximum score `mx` is updated correctly to account for the best possible score a player can achieve by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
