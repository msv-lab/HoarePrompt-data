Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of unique integers from 1 to n), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of turns). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` that were visited, and `s` is updated based on the elements in `p`. The function ensures that each position in `p` is visited at most once, and the lists `a` and `p` remain unchanged. After the function concludes, `s` is the last position visited, `k` is 0 or the remaining turns that were not executed due to a repeated position, and `mx` is the maximum value calculated. **
