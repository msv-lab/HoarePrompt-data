Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`). `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9) and `k` is now `k - 1`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is `k * (a[s[0] - 1] + a[s[1] - 1])` and `mx` is now `(k - 1) * (a[s[0] - 1] + a[s[1] - 1])`. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[s[0] - 1]` and `vis[s[1] - 1]` are 1, and all other elements are 0.**
