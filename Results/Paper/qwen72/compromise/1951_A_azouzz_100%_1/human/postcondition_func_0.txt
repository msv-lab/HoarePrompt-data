The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks the count of '1' characters in `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions: it prints 'YES' if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 0 or 1 and '11' is not a substring of `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
