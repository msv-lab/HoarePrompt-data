You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single argument, which is a list of integers t, where each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= t[i] <= 50, and the length of the list is also within the range 1 <= len(t) <= 50. Each integer n in the list t represents a test case and must satisfy 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each integer `n` in the input list `t`, if `n` is odd, 'NO' was printed. If `n` is even and less than or equal to 200, 'YES' and a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times was printed. If `n` is even and greater than 200, 'NO' was printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `t` where each integer is between 1 and 50, and the list length is also between 1 and 50. It returns a list of results based on the input list `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
