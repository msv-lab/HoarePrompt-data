The function `func` processes `n` test cases, where `n` is an integer input. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints 2. If no such index is found, the function prints 3. The function does not return any value. After processing all `n` test cases, the program state is such that `n` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 2 or 3 has been printed based on the condition.
