You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `n` test cases, where `n` is an integer input. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints 2. If no such index is found, the function prints 3. The function does not return any value. After processing all `n` test cases, the program state is such that `n` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 2 or 3 has been printed based on the condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend \( i \) will come to the party if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive an invitation.
   - \( p_i \) is the best friend of friend \( i \), and \( p_i \neq i \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has two lines: the number of friends \( n \) and the list of best friends \( p \).
   - The output is the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( n \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( x \) and the list of best friends \( l \).
   - It then iterates over the list \( l \) to check if \( l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1 \). This condition checks if the best friend of the best friend of \( i \) is \( i \) itself, forming a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints 3.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The condition \( l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1 \) is used to detect pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. This is correct because if \( l[i] = j \) and \( l[j-1] = i \), then \( i \) and \( j \) form a pair.
   - If such a pair is found, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints 3. This is not always correct. For example, in a cycle of 4 friends (e.g., \( p = [2, 3, 4, 1] \)), the minimum number of invitations needed is 3, but in a cycle of 2 friends (e.g., \( p = [2, 1] \)), the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     2 3 4 1
     ```
   - The program will print 3, which is correct for this case.
   - However, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - The program will print 2, which is correct, but the logic for printing 3 is not always valid.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle cases where no such pairs exist but the minimum number of invitations needed is still 2 (e.g., cycles of 2 friends).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is 2, especially in cases where there are cycles of 2 friends.
