The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. However, since `n` is specified to be an input integer between 2 and 50, we can assume that `n` is already within this valid range. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 0**
