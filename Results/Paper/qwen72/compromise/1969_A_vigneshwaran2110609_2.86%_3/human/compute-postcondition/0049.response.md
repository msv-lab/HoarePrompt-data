Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `x` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, and `flag` is either True or unchanged. If the element at the index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
