Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to decode a string that has been encoded using the described algorithm. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly perform the decoding process. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the input string `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b` in the main program).

2. **Character Replacement**:
   - The program attempts to replace each character in `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from `unique_chars`. However, the logic is flawed:
     - It uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` to replace all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is incorrect because it will replace all instances of `char` in the string, not just the current one.
     - The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect. It inserts characters into `unique_chars` that were not initially in `unique_chars`, which is not part of the decoding algorithm.

3. **Final String Construction**:
   - The program returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is the sorted list of unique characters, not the decoded string. This is clearly incorrect.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
- Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.
- Use this mapping to replace each character in `b` to get the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In this corrected version:
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each character in `s` to its symmetric character in `unique_chars`.
- `decoded_str` is constructed by replacing each character in `s` using the `mapping`.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
