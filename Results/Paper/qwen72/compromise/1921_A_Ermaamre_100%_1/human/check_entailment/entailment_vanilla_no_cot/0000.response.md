Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it extracts the x-coordinates of the four points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).

3. **Area Calculation**: Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length of the square is equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, but the x-coordinates are used here). The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the area of the square for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach is valid and will correctly compute the area of the square for each test case.
