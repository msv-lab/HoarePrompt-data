To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case.
- The length of `result` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in `result` represents the total number of screens required for the corresponding test case.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a list of integers.
   - Each integer in `result` represents the number of screens required for a specific test case.
   - The length of `result` is `n`, meaning there are `n` test cases.

2. **`map(str, result)`**:
   - The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list.
   - This converts each integer in `result` to a string.

3. **`'\n'.join(map(str, result))`**:
   - The `join` method concatenates all the string elements in the list returned by `map(str, result)`.
   - The elements are separated by a newline character (`\n`).

4. **`print` Statement**:
   - The `print` function will output the concatenated string, with each element of `result` on a new line.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Since the exact values of the elements in `result` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the corresponding test case)**
