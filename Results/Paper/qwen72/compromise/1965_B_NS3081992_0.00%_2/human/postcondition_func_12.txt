The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. In the base case, when `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. In the recursive case, it returns `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`.
