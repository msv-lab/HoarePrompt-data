The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates based on the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a string based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If `k` is 1 and `n` is equal to 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'.
- **Case_2**: If `k` is 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, the function returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The list `ans` contains the values [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- **Case_3**: If `k` is not 1, the function returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The list `ans` contains the values [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.

Functionality: **The function returns '1\n2' if `k` is 1 and `n` is 2. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, it returns a space-separated string of the sequence [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, it returns a space-separated string of the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.**
