The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 0**
