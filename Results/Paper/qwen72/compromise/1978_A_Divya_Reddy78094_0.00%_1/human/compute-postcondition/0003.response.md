The function `max_pages` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the maximum number of pages found in any book across all test cases.
