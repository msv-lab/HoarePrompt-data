Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the largest integer `cur` for each test case such that the condition `M[i] <= i` is not violated for any `i` in the range `0` to `cur - 1`. Each test case consists of an integer `S` and a list of `S` integers `N`. The function sorts the list `N` and constructs a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each integer in `N`. The final value of `cur` is determined based on the counts in `M` and the condition mentioned. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
