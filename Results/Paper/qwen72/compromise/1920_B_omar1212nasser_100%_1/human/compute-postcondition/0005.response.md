Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements[i]` <= 1000, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, `pos` is a list containing the initial value and the value of `s` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` after each iteration of the loop.**
