To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is greater than 0, because `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `removals` inclusive. If `removals` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 1 (as the loop starts from 1) and `removals` is greater than 0. The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, and `s2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be greater than 0**
