### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Alice's Goal:** Remove at most \( k \) elements to maximize the sum of the remaining elements.
   - **Bob's Goal:** Multiply at most \( x \) elements by \(-1\) to minimize the sum of the remaining elements.
   - The final sum is the result of both players playing optimally.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \) followed by the array \( a \).
   - The output is the sum of the array after both players have played optimally.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Sorting the Array:** The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order. This helps in identifying the smallest elements, which are the most beneficial to remove or negate.
   - **Initial Sum Calculation:** The sum of the entire array \( s \) is calculated.
   - **Negating Elements:** The sum of the last \( x \) elements (the largest elements) is subtracted twice from \( s \) to simulate the effect of Bob negating these elements. This is stored in `pos[0]`.
   - **Removing Elements:** For each possible number of elements \( i \) that Alice can remove (from 1 to \( k \)):
     - The sum \( s \) is updated by subtracting the \( i \)-th largest element.
     - The sum of the last \( x \) elements \( s2 \) is updated to reflect the removal of the \( i \)-th largest element and the addition of the next largest element if it exists.
     - The new sum after Alice's removal and Bob's negation is calculated and stored in `pos[i]`.
   - **Final Sum:** The maximum value in the list `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element Array:** If \( n = 1 \), Alice can remove the element, and the sum is 0.
   - **No Removals or Negations:** If \( k = 0 \) and \( x = 0 \), the sum remains unchanged.
   - **All Elements Removed:** If \( k \geq n \), the sum is 0.
   - **All Elements Negated:** If \( x \geq n \), the sum is the negative of the sum of the absolute values of the elements.

5. **Code Walkthrough:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, reads \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and the array \( a \).
     - Sorts the array \( a \).
     - Calls `func_2` to get the optimal sum and prints it.
   - **Function 2:**
     - Initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
     - Calculates the initial sum \( s \) of the array.
     - Calculates the initial sum \( s2 \) of the last \( x \) elements.
     - Appends the initial sum after Bob's negation to `pos`.
     - Iterates over the possible number of elements \( i \) that Alice can remove:
       - Updates \( s \) and \( s2 \) to reflect the removal of the \( i \)-th largest element.
       - If there are enough elements left, updates \( s2 \) to reflect the addition of the next largest element.
       - Appends the new sum after Alice's removal and Bob's negation to `pos`.
     - Returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to handle the problem as described. It sorts the array, calculates the initial sum, and iteratively updates the sum to find the optimal sum after both players have played. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
