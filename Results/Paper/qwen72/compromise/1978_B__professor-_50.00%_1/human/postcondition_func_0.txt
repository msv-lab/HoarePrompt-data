The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and a result has been printed for each. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned in each iteration and their final values are those from the last test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
