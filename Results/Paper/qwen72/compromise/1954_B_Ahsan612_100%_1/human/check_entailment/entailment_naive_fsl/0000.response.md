Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and has alternating elements that can be changed to make the array non-beautiful. Specifically, the logic for updating `minn` and `same` is flawed. The program increments `i` twice in some cases, which can skip over elements that should be considered.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the `1`s or `2`s will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly updates `minn` and `same`.

The correct approach should involve checking the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property, and this should be done more carefully to avoid skipping elements.
