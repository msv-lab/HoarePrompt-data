The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `a`. If the list consists of all identical elements or is empty, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values after the function concludes.
