### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **List `c` Creation:**
     - The list `c` is created by taking the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This step is correct because it ensures that Kirill will always choose the cheaper option between bribing the person at position `i` or the people between `j` and `i`.
   - **Suffix Sum Calculation:**
     - The list `suff` is initialized to have `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.
     - The suffix sum is calculated in reverse order, where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is correct because it helps in quickly calculating the total cost of bribing people from position `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
     - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to ensure it will be updated with the minimum cost.
     - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and updates `ans` with the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This is correct because it considers the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the total cost of bribing all people between `i+1` and `n-1`.
   - **Output:**
     - The minimum cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` correctly. In this case, Kirill can only bribe the person at position 1, and the cost will be `a[0]`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k = n` correctly. Here, Kirill can be in any position, and the minimum cost will be the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n \le 200,000\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `k` people in the queue. The state transitions and calculations are all correct and handle the problem constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
