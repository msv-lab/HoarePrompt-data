### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is done to determine the minimum cost Kirill would have to pay to move past each person in the queue. This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a suffix sum array `suff` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then populates the suffix sum array in reverse order. `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of moving past a range of people. This step is also correct and efficient.

4. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
   - It iterates over the first `k` positions and for each position `i`, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This cost includes the cost to move past the person at position `i` and the cost to move past all people from position `i + 1` to `n`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum cost found. This step is correct and ensures that the minimum cost is found efficiently.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 (i.e., Kirill wants to be the first person in the queue) correctly. In this case, the minimum cost will be the cost to move past the first person, which is `a[0]`.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 (i.e., there is only one person in the queue) correctly. In this case, the minimum cost will be `a[0]` since there is no one else to move past.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the suffix sums in O(n) time.
   - The main loop to find the minimum cost runs in O(k) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **Correctness**:
   - The logic used to calculate the minimum cost is correct. It ensures that Kirill can move to any of the first `k` positions with the minimum possible cost by considering both the direct cost to move past the person at position `i` and the cumulative cost to move past all subsequent people.
   - The function `func_1` is called correctly within the main loop, and the output is printed for each test case.

The program is correct and effectively handles the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.
