Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the way it prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers. According to the problem description, the program should print the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the program currently prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what is required.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if x > y:
    print(x, y)
else:
    print(y, x)
```
This should be corrected to:
```python
if x > y:
    print(y, x)
else:
    print(x, y)
```

Additionally, the function name `func` is not descriptive, but this does not affect the correctness of the program. The main issue is the order in which the numbers are printed.

Correctness: **False**
