The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is within the range 0 to 1,000,000,000 (inclusive). The sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. 

The function returns 'No' in Case_1, and 'Yes' in Case_2. Since the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`, the function is likely checking some condition based on this property. However, without more specific details on the conditions for each case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` where the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' in one case and 'Yes' in another case, based on some condition related to the divisibility of the sum of `a` by `n`.**
