Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case. However, the problem specifies that there can be multiple test cases, and the program should handle each test case separately.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the total water is divisible by `n` using `if total_water % n != 0:`. This check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Container Balance Check**: The program uses a cumulative sum approach to check if it is possible to balance the containers. However, this approach is flawed. The program should check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from containers with more water to containers with less water, ensuring that the water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to check if the water can be balanced by pouring water from containers with more water to containers with less water, ensuring that the water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The correct approach involves:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of containers and the amounts of water.
3. Calculating the target amount of water each container should have.
4. Checking if it is possible to balance the containers by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount of water is always non-negative.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    target = sum(a) // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version handles multiple test cases and correctly checks if the containers can be balanced.
