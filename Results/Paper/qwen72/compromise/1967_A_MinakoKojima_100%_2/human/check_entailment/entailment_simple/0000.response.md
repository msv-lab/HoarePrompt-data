### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of card counts.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum number of cards needed to form permutations.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The initial score `ans` is set to the minimum value in the sorted list `a[0]`. This is because the minimum number of cards of any type limits the number of complete permutations we can form initially.

4. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to determine how many additional cards can be bought to increase the score.
   - It calculates the difference `dif` between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means the current and next elements are the same, and it decrements `res` (the number of distinct elements that need to be considered).
   - If `dif` is not zero, it checks if the available coins `k` are sufficient to buy `dif * (i + 1)` cards. If so, it increases `ans` by `dif` and decrements `k` by `dif * (i + 1)`.
   - If `k` is not sufficient, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the remaining coins and updates `ans` and `k` accordingly.
   - The loop breaks if `k` becomes zero, as no more cards can be bought.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it further increases `ans` by `k // n` and adjusts `res` by `k % n`.
   - The final score is calculated by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res` to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final score `ans` to `ans_list` and prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness:

The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output correctly. The iterative calculation and final adjustments ensure that the maximum score is computed accurately. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where `k` is zero or not sufficient to buy additional cards.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
