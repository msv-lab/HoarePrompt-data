Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 1, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * 2`, `ans` is set to `a[1] + dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 3`.**
