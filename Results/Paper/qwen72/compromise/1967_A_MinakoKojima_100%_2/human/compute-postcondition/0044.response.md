Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, and `dif` is equal to `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 2` and `ans` remains the first element of `a`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `res` is `n - 2`, and `k` is `k - dif * 2`. If `dif` is 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `res` is `n - 3`, and `k` is `k - dif * 2`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1 + k % 2` if `i` is not 0 and `dif` is not 0, or `n - 2 + k % 2` if `i` is not 0 and `dif` is 0, or `n - 1` if `i` is 0 and `dif` is not 0, or `n - 2` if `i` is 0 and `dif` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
