Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.***
