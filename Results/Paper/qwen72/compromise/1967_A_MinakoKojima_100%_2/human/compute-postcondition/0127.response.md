Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
