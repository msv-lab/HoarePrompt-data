The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(int(input()))` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is relevant to this condition, but it is not directly part of the loop head. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
