Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations. `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `res`, `k`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans` after this update depends on its initial value and the value of `n`, but the formula for the update is clearly stated.
