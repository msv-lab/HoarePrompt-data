The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins available to buy new cards.
  - `a`: a list of n integers, each a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i.

The function returns a list of results for each test case. The result for each test case is the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be obtained using the available coins `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` of the number of cards of each type. It returns a list where each element is the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be obtained using the available coins for the corresponding test case.**
