Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is the second element of `a` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` plus `dif` and `k` is set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `dif`.
- If `k` was greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` was initially the second element of `a`, and now it is the second element of `a` plus `dif`.
- If `k` was less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` was initially the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and now it is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` plus `dif`.
- The value of `k` is set to 0 in both cases.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `dif` remain unchanged.
