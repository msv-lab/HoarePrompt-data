Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0 or not 0, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
