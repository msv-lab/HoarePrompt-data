Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, `dif` is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, and `i` is not 0.**

Note: The condition `i != 0` is contradictory to the precondition where `i` is 0. Therefore, the if condition will never be true given the precondition. However, for the sake of the exercise, the postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition and adds the if condition.
