Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // 3`, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 1` if `dif` is not 0, or `n - 3` if `dif` is 0.**
