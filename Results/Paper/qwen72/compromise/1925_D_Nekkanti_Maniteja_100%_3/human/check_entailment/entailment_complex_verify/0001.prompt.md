You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `s` is `c * a * k + c * m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2) % M`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it reads `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. The function calculates a value `s` based on the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, the sum of all `f_i` values, and the values of `k` and `m`. The final value of `s` is printed modulo `1000000007` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for modular arithmetic.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads the friendship values for each of the `m` pairs and sums them up in `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions.
   - For each excursion, it updates the sum `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a given excursion is calculated as:
     - `c * i * c * m`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen and their friendship value increasing by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
     - `c * a`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `s % M` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expected Value Calculation:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be broken down as follows:
  - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for a pair of friends is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions is:
    \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i + \frac{2a}{n(n-1)} \right)
    \]
  - Simplifying the sum:
    \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m \cdot i}{n(n-1)} + \frac{2a}{n(n-1)} \right) = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - The sum of the first `k-1` integers is \(\frac{(k-1)k}{2}\):
    \[
    \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)} = \frac{m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k}{n(n-1)} + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - Combining the terms:
    \[
    \frac{m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k + 2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - This can be simplified to:
    \[
    \frac{k \cdot (m \cdot (k-1) + 2a)}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - The program should calculate this value and take it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:
- The program's calculation of the expected value is incorrect. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion.
- The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  \frac{k \cdot (m \cdot (k-1) + 2a)}{n(n-1)} \bmod (10^9 + 7)
  \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_value = (k * (m * (k - 1) + 2 * a) * c) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
- The corrected program is **correct** and should produce the expected results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
