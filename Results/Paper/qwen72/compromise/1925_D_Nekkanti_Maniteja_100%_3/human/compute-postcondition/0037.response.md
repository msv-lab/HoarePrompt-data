Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is equal to `2 * f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**

The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state is updated to reflect these new values, but the other variables remain unchanged.
