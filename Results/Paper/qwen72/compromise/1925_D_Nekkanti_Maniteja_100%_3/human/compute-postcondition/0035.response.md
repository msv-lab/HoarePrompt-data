Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is equal to `2 * f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`.
- Initially, `a` is equal to `f`.
- After the increment, `a` becomes `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged.
