The value of `a` is incremented by `f`. The initial value of `a` is 0, so after the execution, `a` will be equal to `f`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is equal to `f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**
