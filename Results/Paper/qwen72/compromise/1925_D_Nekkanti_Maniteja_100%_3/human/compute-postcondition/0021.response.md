Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than `m + 1`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * (m + 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of `f` values from `m` inputs, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- Since `i` is `m + 1`, the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` becomes `c * (m + 1) * c * m + c * a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged.
