Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `u` is the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `v` is the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `f` is the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `s` is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. Given that the initial value of `s` was `c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` results in `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
