The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. This changes the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` from their initial states to the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**
