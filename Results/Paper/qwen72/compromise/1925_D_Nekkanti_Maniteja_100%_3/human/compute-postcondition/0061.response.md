Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the third input integer plus `f`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the new input values.
- The value of `a` is updated to the sum of the third input integer and `f`.
- All other variables (`M`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `c`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
