Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 1, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the third input integer.**

Explanation:
- The line `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively.
- The initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The variable `a` was initially set to `f`, and since `f` is now updated to the third input integer, `a` is also updated to the third input integer.
- All other variables (`M`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `c`, `s`) remain unchanged.
