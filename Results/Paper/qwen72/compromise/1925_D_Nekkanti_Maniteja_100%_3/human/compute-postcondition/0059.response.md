Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 1, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the third input integer plus `f`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is incremented by `f`.
- Since `a` was initially equal to `f`, after the execution of the code, `a` is now equal to `f + f` or `2 * f`.
- All other variables (`M`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged.
