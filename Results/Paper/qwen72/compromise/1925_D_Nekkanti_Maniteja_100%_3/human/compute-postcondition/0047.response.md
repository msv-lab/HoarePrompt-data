To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `s`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`.
- `M` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`.
- `s` is computed using the formula: `s = s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k`.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations.
- `u` is the last input integer.
- `v` is the second last input integer.
- `f` is the third last input integer.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse (`c`)**:
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`.
   - This means `c` is a number such that `(c * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) % 1000000007 == 1`.

2. **Sum of `f` values (`a`)**:
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations.
   - This means `a` is the sum of the last `m` inputs.

3. **Computation of `s`**:
   - `s` is updated using the formula: `s = s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k`.
   - Let's break this down:
     - `((k-1) * k // 2)` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers.
     - `c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m` is the product of the modular multiplicative inverse `c`, the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, `c` again, and `m`.
     - `c * a * k` is the product of `c`, the sum of all `f` values (`a`), and `k`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(s % M)` statement will print the value of `s` modulo `1000000007`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `s` is computed using the given formula, which involves the modular multiplicative inverse `c`, the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, the sum of all `f` values (`a`), and the input integers `m` and `k`.
- Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`.
- However, the output will be the result of the formula `s = s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k` modulo `1000000007`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s % 1000000007 (where `s` is the result of the formula `s = s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, and `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3)**
