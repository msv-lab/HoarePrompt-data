Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 1, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `u` is the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `v` is the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `f` is the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- Since `s` was initially `c * a`, after the update, `s` becomes `c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- All other variables (`M`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `c`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`) remain unchanged.
