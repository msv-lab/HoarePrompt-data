The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. For example: `def func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5) representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
