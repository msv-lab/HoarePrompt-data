Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`. `gaps` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes an empty list `gaps`.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ans` is incremented based on the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`.
- Since `gaps` is initialized as an empty list, it remains empty after the code execution.
