You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. For example: `def func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5) representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: `n`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged. `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the sum of all `gap` values in `gaps` that are fully consumed by the loop (i.e., `y >= pairs`), plus `2 * y` for the last partial consumption of `gap` (if any).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all fully consumed gap values in gaps plus 2 * y for the last partial consumption of gap, if any)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the number of additional vertices that can be chosen to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, under the constraint that at most `y` additional vertices can be selected. The function prints the total number of ways to choose these additional vertices. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices, along with the calculated and printed value of `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue in how it calculates the number of triangles. Specifically, the logic for adding vertices and calculating the number of triangles is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Triangle Count**:
   ```python
   ans = x - 2
   ```
   This line assumes that the initial number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices is `x - 2`. However, this is not always correct. For example, if Bessie chooses vertices that are adjacent to each other, the number of triangles formed will be less than `x - 2`.

2. **Handling Gaps**:
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
       t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
       t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
       if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
           ans += 1
   ```
   This logic is incorrect because it only checks for specific gaps and does not handle all possible configurations of vertices. For example, if Bessie chooses vertices 1, 2, and 3 in an 8-sided polygon, the program will incorrectly add triangles.

3. **Gap Calculation and Sorting**:
   ```python
   gaps = []
   for i in range(x):
       next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
       gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
       if gap > 0:
           gaps.append(gap)
   gaps.sort()
   ```
   This part correctly calculates the gaps between chosen vertices, but the subsequent logic for adding vertices and calculating triangles is flawed.

4. **Adding Vertices and Calculating Triangles**:
   ```python
   for gap in gaps:
       pairs = gap // 2
       if y >= pairs:
           ans += gap
           y -= pairs
       else:
           ans += 2 * y
           break
   ```
   This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices. The number of triangles that can be formed by adding a vertex in a gap is not simply `gap` or `2 * y`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
8 4 2
1 2 3 4
```
- Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The program will incorrectly calculate the number of triangles as `x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.
- However, the correct number of triangles that can be formed is 0 because the chosen vertices are adjacent and do not form any triangles.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
