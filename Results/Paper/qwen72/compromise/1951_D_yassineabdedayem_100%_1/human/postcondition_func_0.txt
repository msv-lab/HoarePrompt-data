The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) from the input. It then checks if `n` equals `k`. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by 2 and the values `n - k + 1` and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the input stream has been consumed for `t` lines. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the input stream is advanced.
