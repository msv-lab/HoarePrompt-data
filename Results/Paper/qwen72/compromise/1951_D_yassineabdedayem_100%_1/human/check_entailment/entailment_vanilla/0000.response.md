### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and wants to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins or buys `k` jewels.
   - We need to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks three conditions:
     - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin.
     - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin each.
     - This is correct because Alice will spend all her coins on the first stall and buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Condition 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
     - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2k - 2`.
     - If `n > 2k - 2`, Bob can set up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.
     - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall (since `n - k + 1` is the price per jewel, and she has `n` coins, she can buy `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels, which is `k - 1`).
     - She will then have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1 - 1) = n - (n - k) = k` coins left.
     - She will buy the remaining 1 jewel from the second stall, which has a price of 1 coin.
     - This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Condition 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
     - If `n + 2 <= k * 2`, it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - This is because if `n <= 2k - 2`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels even if the price of each jewel is 1 coin (since she would need at least `k` coins to buy `k` jewels, and she has fewer than `2k - 2` coins).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the three conditions and ensures that Bob can set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels if it is possible.
   - The conditions and the logic for setting up the stalls are sound and cover all necessary cases.
