You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it updates the `sm` variable, which is supposed to keep track of the number of matching elements between the current subsegment of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the logic for updating `sm` when sliding the window over the array `a` is incorrect. Here is the problematic part:

```python
if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
    sm += 1
ca[a[r]] += 1
if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
    sm -= 1
ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
```

This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the changes in the number of matching elements when the window slides. The correct way to update `sm` should be:

1. Subtract the contribution of the element that is leaving the window.
2. Add the contribution of the element that is entering the window.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Subtract the contribution of the element that is leaving the window
        if ca[a[r - m]] > 0 and ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

        # Add the contribution of the element that is entering the window
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1

        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good. However, the given program will output `4`, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Example Case:
- Subsegment starting at position 1: `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (3 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 2: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (4 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 3: `[2, 3, 4, 5]` (3 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 4: `[3, 4, 5, 6]` (2 matches with `b`)

The program incorrectly counts the subsegment starting at position 4 as good, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
