### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (n, m, k) and the arrays a and b.
   - This part of the program is accurate and does not need any changes.

2. **Counter Initialization**:
   - `cb = Counter(sorted(b))`: This creates a frequency counter for the sorted elements of array b. Sorting is not strictly necessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - `ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`: This creates a frequency counter for the first m elements of array a. Again, sorting is not necessary but does not affect correctness.
   - This part is also accurate and does not need any changes.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - `sm = sum((ca & cb).values())`: This calculates the number of matching elements between the initial subsegment of a and b. The `&` operator on two Counters returns a Counter with elements that are common to both, and their counts are the minimum of the counts in the original Counters.
   - `if sm >= k: ans += 1`: This checks if the initial subsegment is good and increments the answer if it is.
   - This part is correct and accurately initializes the match count and the answer.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length m in array a.
   - `for r in range(m, n)`: This loop iterates over the indices from m to n-1, effectively sliding the window one position to the right each time.
   - **Issue with Sliding Window Logic**:
     - The original logic for updating the match count (`sm`) is incorrect. The program should only increment or decrement `sm` based on whether the new element in the window (a[r]) and the element sliding out of the window (a[r - m]) change the number of matches.
     - Specifically, the lines:
       ```python
       if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]: sm += 1
       ca[a[r]] += 1
       if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1
       ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
       ```
       should be adjusted to:
       ```python
       sm += (ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]])
       ca[a[r]] += 1
       sm -= (ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])
       ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
       ```
     - The original logic incorrectly updates `sm` by checking the conditions before updating the counters, which can lead to incorrect match counts.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.
   - This part is correct and does not need any changes.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        sm += (ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]])
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        sm -= (ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program correctly handles the sliding window updates and ensures that the match count (`sm`) is updated accurately.
- The program correctly counts the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (after the corrections mentioned above)
