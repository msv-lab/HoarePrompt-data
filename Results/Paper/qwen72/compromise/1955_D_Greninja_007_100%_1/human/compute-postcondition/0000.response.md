Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cb` is assigned the result of `Counter(sorted(b))`.
- `sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` in ascending order.
- `Counter(sorted(b))` creates a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The new state includes the updated value of `cb` and retains all other initial conditions.
