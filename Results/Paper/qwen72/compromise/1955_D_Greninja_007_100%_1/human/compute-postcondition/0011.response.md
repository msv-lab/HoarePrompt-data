Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of contiguous subarrays (windows) of size `m` in the list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the subarray and the list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function does not modify any global state. **
