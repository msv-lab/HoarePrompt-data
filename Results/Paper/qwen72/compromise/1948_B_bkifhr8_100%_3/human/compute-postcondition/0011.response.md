Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
