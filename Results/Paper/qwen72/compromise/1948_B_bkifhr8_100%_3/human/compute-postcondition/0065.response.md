The code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and then appends the integer `arr[i]` to this list. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `_` is a placeholder
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True
- `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`

Let's break it down:
- `arr[i - 1]` is an integer, and `str(arr[i - 1])` converts it to a string.
- `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts each character in the string to an integer, creating a list of digits.
- `[arr[i]]` is a list containing the integer `arr[i]`.
- The two lists are concatenated, and the result is assigned to `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
