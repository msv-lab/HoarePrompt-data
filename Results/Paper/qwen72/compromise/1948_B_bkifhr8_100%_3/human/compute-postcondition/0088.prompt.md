Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is expected to be provided in a specific format with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing `n` and the second line containing the `n` integers of the array `a`. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `ans` is False if any of the conditions in the loop caused it to be set to False, otherwise `ans` remains True. If any `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` during the loop, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise `ans` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
