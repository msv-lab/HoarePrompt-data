Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `_` remains a placeholder.
- `m` remains an input integer that must be greater than 3.
- `arr` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` remains `m - 3`.
- `ans` remains True.
- `nums` is updated to a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.
- The value of `arr[i - 1]` is now the first element of `nums`, which is the first digit of the integer `arr[i - 1]`.
