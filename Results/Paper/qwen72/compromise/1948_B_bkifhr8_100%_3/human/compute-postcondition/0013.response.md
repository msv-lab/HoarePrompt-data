Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.***
