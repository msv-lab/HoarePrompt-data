Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise `ans` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is using a list with two elements: `['NO', 'YES']`.
- The value of `ans` determines which element of the list is printed.
- If `ans` is True, the second element of the list (`'YES'`) will be printed.
- If `ans` is False, the first element of the list (`'NO'`) will be printed.

### Determining `ans`:
- `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists.
- `ans` is False if the loop found any unsorted `nums` lists.

### Conclusion:
- The output will be `'YES'` if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists.
- The output will be `'NO'` if the loop found any unsorted `nums` lists.

Since the exact values of `arr` and the logic of the loop are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the value of `ans`.

Output: **'YES' if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise 'NO'**.
