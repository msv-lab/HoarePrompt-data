Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration. `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`.
- Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1, which refers to the last element of the list `arr`.
- Therefore, the last element of `arr` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
