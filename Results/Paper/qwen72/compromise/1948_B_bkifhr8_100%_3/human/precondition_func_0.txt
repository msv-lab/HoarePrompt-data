The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is expected to be provided in a specific format with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing `n` and the second line containing the `n` integers of the array `a`.
