Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function starts by assuming that it is possible to sort the array (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates over the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the function to check if the current element is smaller than the previous element, which is a necessary condition for the array to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Condition Check**: If the current element `arr[i]` is smaller than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, the function splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to the list of digits (`nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`).

5. **Sorting Check**: The function then checks if the list of digits and the current element is sorted (`if nums != sorted(nums)`). If it is not sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is not possible to sort the array.

6. **Update Array**: If the list of digits and the current element is sorted, the function updates the previous element to the first digit of the list (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`).

7. **Output**: After processing all elements in the array for the current test case, the function prints 'YES' if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**: The function splits the previous element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends the current element `arr[i]` to this list. This is not the correct way to split and insert the digits. Instead, the element `arr[i - 1]` should be replaced by its digits in the array, and then the array should be checked for sorted order.

- **Sorting Check**: The function checks if the list of digits and the current element is sorted, but it should actually check if the entire array can be sorted after performing the operation.

- **Array Modification**: The function modifies the array by setting `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the list, but this does not reflect the actual operation described in the problem, which requires inserting all digits in place of the element.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
