Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle the transformation of elements into their constituent digits. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program processes the element that needs to be split and how it checks the sorted condition.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Splitting of Elements:**
   - The program splits the element `arr[i-1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. However, it should split `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` into their digits and then check if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - The correct approach should be to split both `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` into their digits and then check if the concatenated list of digits is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Array Update:**
   - The program updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split element, but it does not properly handle the insertion of the remaining digits or the removal of the original element.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that properly handles the splitting and checking of elements:

```python
def can_be_sorted():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                # Split both elements into their digits
                nums1 = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i - 1])]
                nums2 = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                # Combine the digits and check if they are sorted
                combined = nums1 + nums2
                if combined != sorted(combined):
                    ans = False
                    break
                # Replace the elements with the combined digits
                arr[i - 1:i + 1] = combined
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

# Example usage:
# can_be_sorted()
```

### Explanation:
- **Splitting Elements:** The elements `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` are split into their constituent digits using list comprehensions.
- **Combining and Checking:** The digits are combined into a single list and checked if they are sorted.
- **Updating the Array:** If the combined list is sorted, the original elements are replaced with the combined list of digits.

This corrected program should now correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operations.
