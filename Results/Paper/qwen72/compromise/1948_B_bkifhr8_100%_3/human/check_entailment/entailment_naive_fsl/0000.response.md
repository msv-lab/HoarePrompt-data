Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where an element in the array is greater than or equal to 10 and needs to be split into its digits to achieve a sorted array. Specifically, the program only checks if the digits of the element are sorted, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the element and inserting the digits back into the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will output `NO` because it checks if the digits of `12` are sorted, which they are, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and inserting them back into the array. The correct output should be `YES` because after splitting `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
