You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only the characters "U" and "D".
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only the characters "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' if the number of "U" characters is even.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - If only two coins are left, one is removed and the other is not flipped.
   - If only one coin is left, no coins are flipped.
   - If no facing-up coins are left, the player whose turn it is loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move when it is his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is read in one go using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string.
   - The input is then split into a list of strings using `split()`.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the number of coins `n` and the string `s` are extracted from the list.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` to determine the winner.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
