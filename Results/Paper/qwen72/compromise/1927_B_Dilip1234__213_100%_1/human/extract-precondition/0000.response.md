Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for the given trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**
