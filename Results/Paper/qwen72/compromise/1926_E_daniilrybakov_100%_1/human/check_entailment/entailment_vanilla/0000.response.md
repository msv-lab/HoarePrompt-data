### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
   - It enters a loop where it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the number of cards that are multiples of `m` and are odd.
   - It then updates `n` to `n // 2`, which effectively reduces the problem to the next set of multiples.
   - The loop continues until it finds the set of multiples where `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in that set.
   - Once the correct set is found, it prints the k-th card in that set using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `s` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
     - `m` is the current multiplier (1 for odd cards, 2 for twice an odd number, etc.).
   - **Loop:**
     - `x = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of cards that are multiples of `m` and are odd.
     - `n //= 2` reduces `n` to the next set of multiples.
     - The loop checks if `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in the current set (`s < k and k <= s + x`).
     - If `k` is within this range, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it updates `s` to include the cards laid down in the current set and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next set.
   - **Output:**
     - The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` calculates the k-th card in the current set.
     - `2 * (k - s) - 1` gives the position of the card within the current set of multiples.
     - Multiplying by `m` gives the actual card number.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 1`:
     - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
     - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2 = 3`
     - `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, so the loop breaks.
     - The k-th card is `(2 * (1 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 1`.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 2`:
     - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
     - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2 = 3`
     - `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, so the loop breaks.
     - The k-th card is `(2 * (2 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 3`.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 4`:
     - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
     - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2 = 3`
     - `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, so the loop breaks.
     - The k-th card is `(2 * (4 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 7`.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
     - `s = 4`, `m = 2`
     - `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n //= 2 = 1`
     - `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, so the loop breaks.
     - The k-th card is `(2 * (5 - 4) - 1) * 2 = 2`.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 7`:
     - `s = 6`, `m = 4`
     - `x = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`, `n //= 2 = 0`
     - `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, so the loop breaks.
     - The k-th card is `(2 * (7 - 6) - 1) * 4 = 4`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 and `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is the last card correctly, as seen in the example with `n = 1000000000` and `k = 1000000000`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles all the given test cases and edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
