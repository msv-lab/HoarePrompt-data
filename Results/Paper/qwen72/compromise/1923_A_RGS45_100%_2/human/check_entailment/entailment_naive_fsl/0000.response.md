Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips and the optimal solution involves moving chips from the right block to the left block. For example, consider the input:

```
1
8
1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
```

The expected output is `2` because the optimal solution is to move the chip from the 6th cell to the 4th cell, and then move the chip from the 7th cell to the 5th cell. However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations.
