Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a list of integers (converted to a string for processing).

2. **Finding Chip Positions**: The function correctly identifies the first and last positions of the chips using `arr.find('1')` and `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This ensures that the first and last chips are located accurately.

3. **Extracting the Substring**: The function then extracts the substring `z` from the first occurrence of '1' to the last occurrence of '1'. This substring represents the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips.

4. **Counting Free Cells**: The function counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`, which represents the number of free cells between the first and last chips. This is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), the function will correctly print `0` because there are no free cells between the first and last chips.
   - If there are no chips in the ribbon, the function will not encounter this situation because the problem guarantees that each test case contains at least one chip.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

However, there is a potential issue with the input handling:
- The function reads the input as a string and then converts it to a single string without spaces. This works, but it might be more intuitive to read the input as a list of integers directly. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
