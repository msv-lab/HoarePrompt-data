### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Let's analyze the program and the function `func_1` in detail:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The task is to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The output string `s` should be the shortest possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and repeating this substring `n` times.

3. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs the string `s` by repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function will return `abcabc`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are included in the output string `s`.
   - For the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the correct output should include all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`.
   - The string `abcabc` does not include the subsequence `cb`, which is a valid subsequence of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets.
   - The correct output for this test case could be `abcbac`, which includes all the required subsequences.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not generate a string that meets the problem's requirements.
   - Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
