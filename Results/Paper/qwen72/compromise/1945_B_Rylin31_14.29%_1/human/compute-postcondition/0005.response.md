Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from input, representing the frequencies of launching fireworks for two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively. The function then calculates and prints the total number of distinct moments within the first `m` seconds when at least one firework is visible from either installation. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
