Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained between iterations, and `t` remains unchanged. For each iteration, the loop reads new values for `a`, `b`, and `m` from input and prints the result of the computation based on these values. After `t` iterations, the loop finishes, and `t` is still the same as in the initial state.**
