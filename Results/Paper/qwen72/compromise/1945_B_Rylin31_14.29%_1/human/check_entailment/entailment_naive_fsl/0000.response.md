Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Specifically, the program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m` and then uses this value to determine the number of fireworks visible at the same time. However, this approach does not correctly account for the time overlap of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every 4 minutes. Each firework is visible for 11 minutes (from `x` to `x + 10`).

The correct output should be 7, as the fireworks launched at the following times will be visible simultaneously:
- First installation: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
- Second installation: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]

At time 12, there will be 7 fireworks visible:
- 4 from the first installation (launched at 3, 6, 9, 12)
- 3 from the second installation (launched at 4, 8, 12)

However, the provided program outputs 6, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the maximum overlap of fireworks. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time can be calculated by considering the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.

The correct solution should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b
        if (m + 1) % lcm == 0:
            max_fireworks -= 1
        print(max_fireworks)

from math import gcd
```

This approach correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the LCM and the visibility window.
