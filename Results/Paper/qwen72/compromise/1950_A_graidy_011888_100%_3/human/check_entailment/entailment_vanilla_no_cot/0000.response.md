Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if three digits form a "STAIR," a "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR."
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK."
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE."

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

The program handles all the cases as described in the problem and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
