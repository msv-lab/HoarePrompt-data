Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are equal correctly. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "STAIR" if the digits are in increasing order, even if they are all the same. For example, with the input `1 1 1`, the program will output "STAIR" instead of "NONE".
