Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the case where the digits are equal correctly. The condition for a "STAIR" is `a < b < c`, which means that `a`, `b`, and `c` must be strictly increasing. If all three digits are the same (e.g., `1 1 1`), the condition `a < b < c` will not be satisfied because `1 < 1 < 1` is false. Therefore, the program will correctly output "NONE" for such cases.

To further validate this, let's consider the logic in the program:
- If `a < b < c` is true, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b` and `b > c` is true, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

For the case `1 1 1`:
- `a < b < c` is `1 < 1 < 1`, which is false.
- `a < b` and `b > c` is `1 < 1` and `1 > 1`, which is also false.
- Therefore, it falls into the "else" block and prints "NONE".

This matches the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
