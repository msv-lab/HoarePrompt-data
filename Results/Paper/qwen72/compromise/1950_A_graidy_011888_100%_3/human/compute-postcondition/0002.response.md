Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated with each iteration, but the value of `n` will remain unchanged.**
