The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, `n` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding output has been printed for each case.
