Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is now equal to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[0]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`, `n` must be greater than 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a[2]` has been updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
