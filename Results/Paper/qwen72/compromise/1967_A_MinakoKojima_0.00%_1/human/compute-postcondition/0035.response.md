Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, and `k` is now `k - n * m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to `k - n * m`, where `n` and `m` retain their initial values. The other variables remain unchanged.
