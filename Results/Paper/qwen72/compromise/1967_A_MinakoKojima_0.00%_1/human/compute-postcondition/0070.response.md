Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `k` is further updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`, `k` is further updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- The value of `k` is further updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
