Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` reassigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
