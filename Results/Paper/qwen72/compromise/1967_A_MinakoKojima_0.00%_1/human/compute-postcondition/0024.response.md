The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is now equal to `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is now equal to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.**
