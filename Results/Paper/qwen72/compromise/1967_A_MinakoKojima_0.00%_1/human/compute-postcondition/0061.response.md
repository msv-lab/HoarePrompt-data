Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `_`, `a`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.
