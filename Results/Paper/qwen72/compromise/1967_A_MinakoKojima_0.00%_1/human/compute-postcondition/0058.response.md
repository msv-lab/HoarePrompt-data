Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers input by the user, which is now updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `m` is still the smallest integer in the list `a`, but the list `a` has been updated, so `m` will be the smallest integer in the new list.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.
