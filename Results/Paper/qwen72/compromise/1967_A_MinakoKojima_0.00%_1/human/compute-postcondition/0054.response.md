Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1`, `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, and `ans` is set to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.**
