The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is now equal to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `n` must be greater than 1**
