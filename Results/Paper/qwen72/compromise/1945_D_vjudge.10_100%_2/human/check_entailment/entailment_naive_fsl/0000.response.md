Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not defined properly, and the program does not handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position within the first `m` people in the queue. 

A potential case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

Expected Output:
14
```

The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. The function `func_1` is called but does not return or update any value that is used to determine the final output. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of Kirill bribing people to move forward in the queue.
