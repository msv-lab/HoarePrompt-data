### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and the function summary to understand why:

1. **Function Call and Return Value**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` as arguments.
   - However, `func_1` does not return any value, and the `pergunta` variable is not updated in the main loop. This means that the value of `pergunta` remains `float('inf')` and is printed as such, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `x` to 0.
   - It then iterates from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order.
   - For each `i`, if `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
   - It adds `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x` for each `i`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` is attempting to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
   - However, the way it calculates the cost is flawed. The variable `x` is supposed to accumulate the cost of moving Kirill forward, but it does so in a way that does not correctly simulate the process of bribing people to move forward in the queue.
   - Specifically, the cost `x` is incremented by `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i`, but this does not account for the fact that Kirill can only bribe people in front of him, and the cost of bribing each person should be added to the total cost in a more dynamic way.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4 2
     7 3 6 9
     4 3 8 5
     ```
   - The expected output is `14`.
   - The program's logic will not produce this output because it does not correctly simulate the process of Kirill moving forward in the queue and calculating the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and it will not produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Final: **False**
