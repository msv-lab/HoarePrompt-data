To ensure the `while` loop can execute for the first time, we need to focus on the condition `nums.get(start, 0)`. This condition checks if the value of `start` (which is 0) exists in the `nums` Counter object and if its count is greater than 0. If `start` is 0 and `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value, the loop will execute.

Given the state:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

We need to ensure that `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value. Since `start` is 0, we need to ensure that the integer 0 is present in `arr` and has a non-zero count in `nums`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `nums` and `start`.
2. **Check the Condition**: The condition `nums.get(start, 0)` checks if the value of `start` (which is 0) exists in `nums` and if its count is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` is greater than 0. This means that the integer 0 must be present in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Since `start` is 0, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the integer 0 is present in `arr` and has a non-zero count in `nums`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr` and `nums[0]` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
