Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 32`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` lines have been printed, each containing either 'A' or 'B' based on the comparison of 'A' and 'B' counts in the corresponding input string. **
