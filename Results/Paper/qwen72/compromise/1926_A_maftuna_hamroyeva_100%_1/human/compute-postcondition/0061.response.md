The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` was 1 if `j` is not 'A', and 0 if `j` is 'A'. Therefore, the new value of `h` will be 2 if `j` is not 'A', and 1 if `j` is 'A'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty user-provided string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
