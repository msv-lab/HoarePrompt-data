### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs a sequence where:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, where `counter` is the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k` (i.e., the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
     - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the first two elements equals `k`.
     - The remaining `n-2` elements are 0.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` returns the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` minus one.
   - This is used to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Sequence Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the sequence is constructed as follows:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`.
     - The second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, which ensures the sum of the first two elements equals `k`.
     - The remaining elements are 0, which do not affect the bitwise OR result.
   - For `n == 1`, the sequence is simply `k`.

5. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will be maximized by setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1` because this number has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation for the given `k`.
   - The second element is chosen to ensure the sum is `k` and does not introduce any additional 1s in the bitwise OR if it is not necessary.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly by simply printing `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures the sum of the sequence is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies the given conditions and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

**Correctness: True**
