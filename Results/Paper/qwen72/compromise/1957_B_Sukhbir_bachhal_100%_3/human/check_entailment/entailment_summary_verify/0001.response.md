### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is \( k \).
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is greater than 1, it uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position set in \( k \).
   - It then constructs the sequence:
     - The first element is \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \), which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
     - The second element is \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \), which ensures the sum of the first two elements equals \( k \).
     - The remaining \( n-2 \) elements are set to 0.
   - If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns the highest bit position set in \( n \).
   - It works by right-shifting \( n \) until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns the position of the highest bit minus 1 (since bit positions are 0-indexed).

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the sequence is \( k \). For \( n > 1 \), the sum is \( (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) = k \). For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( k \).
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - The number \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
     - The second number \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) will have bits set in positions that are not covered by \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \).
     - The bitwise OR of these two numbers will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \), which is the maximum possible number of 1s.
   - **Handling \( n = 1 \):** When \( n = 1 \), the sequence is simply \( k \), which trivially satisfies the conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **\( n = 1 \):** The program correctly handles this case by printing \( k \).
   - **\( k = 0 \):** The program does not handle \( k = 0 \) explicitly, but since \( k \geq 1 \) as per the problem constraints, this is not an issue.
   - **\( n > 1 \) and \( k \) is a power of 2:** The program will correctly set the first element to \( k - 1 \) and the second element to 1, ensuring the sum is \( k \) and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

6. **Verification with Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns the highest bit position set in \( n \) minus one.
   - For example, if \( k = 5 \), `func_1(5)` returns 2 because the binary representation of 5 is \( 101_2 \), and the highest bit position is 2 (0-indexed).
   - This ensures that \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) (binary \( 11_2 \)) and \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) (binary \( 10_2 \)), and their bitwise OR is \( 3 | 2 = 3 \) (binary \( 11_2 \)), which has the maximum number of 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The function `func_1` is used correctly to determine the highest bit position, and the sequence construction logic is sound.

Final: **True**
