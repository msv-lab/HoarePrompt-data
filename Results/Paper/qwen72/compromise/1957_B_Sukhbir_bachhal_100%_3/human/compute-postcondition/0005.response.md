Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer.
- Since `n` was initially a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, after the right shift, `n` will be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- The value of `position` remains unchanged at 0.
