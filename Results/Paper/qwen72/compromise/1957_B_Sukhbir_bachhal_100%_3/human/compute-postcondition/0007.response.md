The variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, but only `n` is used in the loop condition. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0. Since `n` is already not equal to 0, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 1**
