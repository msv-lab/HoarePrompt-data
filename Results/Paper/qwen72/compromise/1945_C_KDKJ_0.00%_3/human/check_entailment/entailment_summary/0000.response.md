### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is specified in the problem statement.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is the correct approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Cumulative Counts**:
   - `func_1` computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in the list `S`.
   - This is necessary to efficiently determine the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of any potential road position.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each potential road position `i`, the function checks if the number of '0's on the left side (`left`) is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side (`lsum`).
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of '1's on the right side (`right`) is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side (`rsum`).
   - These conditions are correctly implemented using the inequalities `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - The function selects the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village (`n / 2`).
   - It uses the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` to ensure that the chosen position is the closest to the middle among all valid positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case, which is the required output format.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The cumulative counts are computed correctly.
- The conditions for the number of '0's and '1's on each side are checked correctly.
- The optimal position is selected based on the criteria specified in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
