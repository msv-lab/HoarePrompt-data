Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house correctly. Specifically, the program does not check these edge cases where `i = 0` or `i = n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
000
```
The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition (all residents are on the right side, and they all want to be on the left side, which is not possible, so the road should be laid before the first house).

However, the program will output `3` because it does not consider the case where `i = 0` or `i = n` as valid positions to lay the road. The program should explicitly check these edge cases to ensure it meets the problem requirements.
