Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze why:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - This is correct. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - This is incorrect. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) should have a size of 6, but the program only outputs 5 points, which is not valid since \(n = 4\).

4. **For \(n = 5\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
   - This is incorrect. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) should have a size of 8, but the program only outputs 6 points, which is not valid since \(n = 5\).

5. **For \(n = 6\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
   - This is incorrect. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) should have a size of 10, but the program only outputs 6 points, which is not valid since \(n = 6\).

The program fails to correctly handle cases where \(n > 3\). It does not generate the required number of points and does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
