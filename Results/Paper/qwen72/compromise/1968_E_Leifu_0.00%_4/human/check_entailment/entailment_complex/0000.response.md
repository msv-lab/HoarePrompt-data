Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's approach is to print a specific set of points for each \(n\):

1. For \(n = 2\), it prints:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

2. For \(n = 3\), it prints:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (2, 3)
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

3. For \(n > 3\), it prints:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (2, 4)
   - (j, j) for \(j\) ranging from 4 to \(n\)
   This approach is intended to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, let's analyze the distances generated by this approach:

   - The distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is 1.
   - The distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\).
   - The distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\).
   - The distance between (1, 1) and (j, j) for \(j \geq 4\) is \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\).
   - The distance between (1, 2) and (j, j) for \(j \geq 4\) is \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1.5) = 2j - 3\).
   - The distance between (2, 4) and (j, j) for \(j \geq 4\) is \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-3)\).

   The set of distances generated by the above points will include:
   - 0 (distance between any point and itself)
   - 1 (distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2))
   - 3 (distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4))
   - 4 (distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4))
   - \(2(j-1)\) for \(j \geq 4\)
   - \(2j - 3\) for \(j \geq 4\)
   - \(2(j-3)\) for \(j \geq 4\)

   The distances \(2(j-1)\), \(2j - 3\), and \(2(j-3)\) will be distinct for different values of \(j\), and they will cover a range of values from 4 to \(2(n-1)\), \(2n - 3\), and \(2(n-3)\) respectively. This ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will have a large number of distinct values.

However, the program has a flaw in its approach for \(n > 3\). Specifically, the distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is 4, and the distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is 3, but the distances between (1, 1) and (j, j) for \(j \geq 4\) are all even, and the distances between (1, 2) and (j, j) for \(j \geq 4\) are all odd. This means that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will not include all possible distances, especially the smaller odd distances that could be achieved by different placements.

A more optimal approach would be to place points in a way that maximizes the range of distances. For example, placing points along the diagonal and one additional point off the diagonal can achieve this. However, the current program does not do this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for \(n > 3\) because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as required.

Correctness: **False**
