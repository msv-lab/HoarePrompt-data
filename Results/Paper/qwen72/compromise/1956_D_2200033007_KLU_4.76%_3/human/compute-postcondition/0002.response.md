Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 18`.
- Each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies `0 <= a_i <= 10^7`.
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'4 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is using an f-string to print the values `4` and `1`.
- The values `4` and `1` are explicitly provided in the f-string and are not dependent on any variables or objects in the initial state.
- The initial state provides information about the list `c` and the variable `m`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `4 1` exactly as it is written in the code.

Output: **4 1**
