Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and appends each string to the list `a`. However, the elements of `a` are stored as strings, not integers. This is a significant issue because the MEX operation and the subsequent operations on the array require the elements to be integers.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because `func_1` expects a list of integers, not the length of the list. The function should be called with the actual list `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is the length of the array.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is equal to 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which is the correct output for an array of length 2 with elements `[0, 1]` as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`, which is the correct output for an array of length 3 with elements `[1, 3, 9]` as shown in the second example.
   - The function then returns, but the return value is not used.

4. **Output**:
   - For the first example with `n = 2` and `a = [0, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For the second example with `n = 3` and `a = [1, 3, 9]`, the program correctly outputs `13 0`.
   - However, the program does not handle other cases correctly. For example, it does not handle the third example with `n = 4` and `a = [1, 100, 2, 1]` or the fourth example with `n = 1` and `a = [0]`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program only handles the specific cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3. It does not provide a general solution for arrays of other lengths.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
   - The program fails to handle the general case and does not follow the problem description for arrays of lengths other than 2 or 3.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is not correct for the general case. It only works for specific lengths of the array (2 and 3) and does not handle other lengths or different array contents.
   - The input handling is incorrect, as the elements of the array are stored as strings instead of integers.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

Final: **False**
