Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if the length of the array `c` is 2 and prints a fixed output of `4 1` followed by `1 2`. For any other length, it prints `13 0`, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, but it stores the elements of the array as strings in the list `a`. This is a minor issue but can be fixed by converting the elements to integers.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing the MEX operation. However, the function only has a hardcoded logic for arrays of length 2 and length not equal to 2. It does not compute the MEX or perform any operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths.

3. **Output for Different Lengths**: The program fails to handle arrays of lengths other than 2 correctly. For example, for the input:
   ```
   4
   1 100 2 1
   ```
   The correct output should be:
   ```
   105 2
   3 3
   3 4
   ```
   However, the program will output:
   ```
   13 0
   ```
   This is clearly incorrect, as the program does not compute the maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it for arrays of length other than 2.

4. **General Case Handling**: The problem requires a more general approach to handle arrays of any length between 1 and 18. The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and update the subarray elements accordingly. It also does not track the number of operations performed.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The program is not capable of solving the problem for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
