Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it only handles the specific case where the length of the array `a` is 2. For any other length, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`, which is not correct for all possible inputs. The program does not compute the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` or the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum for arrays of lengths other than 2. 

For instance, the program fails to handle the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is clearly incorrect, as the program does not account for the actual values in the array or the operations needed to maximize the sum. The function `func_1` is overly simplistic and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
