Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square. It then extracts the x-coordinates of these points and calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates will be the same as the difference in y-coordinates, and thus, the area of the square can be correctly calculated as the side length squared.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The program assumes that the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) of the given points will always differ by the side length of the square. This is true for squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but the program does not explicitly check if the given points form a valid square. For example, if the points were not forming a square but a rectangle, the program would still compute an area, which would be incorrect.

Given the problem description, it is guaranteed that the input will always form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the program will work correctly under these constraints. However, if the input were not guaranteed to form a square, the program would need additional validation to ensure the points form a valid square.

Since the problem guarantees valid input, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
