Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and each test case is guaranteed to represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: The loop will print the area of each square (which is the side length squared) for each test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the list of test cases will also remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` will be overwritten in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be those from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the user input. Each test case consists of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, the function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. It then prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared. The function does not return any value; it only prints the areas of the squares for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is not stored or modified. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be those from the last test case.
