You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and each test case is guaranteed to represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: The loop will print the area of each square (which is the side length squared) for each test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the list of test cases will also remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` will be overwritten in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be those from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) that represent the corners of a square. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding test case represents a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
