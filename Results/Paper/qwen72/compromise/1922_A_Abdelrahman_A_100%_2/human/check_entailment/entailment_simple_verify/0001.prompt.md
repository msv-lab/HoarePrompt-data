You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The loop has executed `tests` times, and for each iteration, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `slength` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`. This is correct because if `c` is the same as `a` or `b`, it cannot be unmatched with any template that matches `a` and `b`.

3. **Template Matching Check:**
   - The program initializes a counter to 0 and iterates through each character of `c`.
   - For each character `x` in `c`, it checks if `x` is not in the corresponding position of `a` and `b` (i.e., `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`).
   - If `x` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "YES", breaking out of the loop. This is incorrect because it only checks if `x` is not equal to `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`, but it should also ensure that `a[counter]` and `b[counter]` are the same and not equal to the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position. In such cases, it is impossible to find a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the template matching check. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position. Additionally, it does not ensure that the template character is uppercase when `a` and `b` have the same character at the same position.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if a and b are the same
        if a == b:
            # Check if c is different from a and b at any position
            for i in range(slength):
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    print('YES')
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if there exists a position where a and b are different and c matches one of them
            for i in range(slength):
                if a[i] != b[i]:
                    if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                        print('NO')
                        break
                else:
                    if c[i] == a[i]:
                        print('YES')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Check:**
   - If `a` and `b` are the same, we need to check if `c` is different from `a` (or `b`) at any position. If so, we can use an uppercase template character for that position, and `c` will not match the template.

2. **Different Characters Check:**
   - If `a` and `b` are different at any position, we need to ensure that `c` does not match `a` or `b` at that position. If `c` matches either `a` or `b` at any position where `a` and `b` are different, it is impossible to find a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Same Characters Check:**
   - If `a` and `b` are the same at a position and `c` is different, we can use an uppercase template character for that position, and `c` will not match the template.

This corrected program ensures that the template conditions are correctly checked and handles all edge cases.
