Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are unchanged; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells; `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The variable `rows` is still a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.
- A new variable `costs` is created, which is a list of length `n`. Each element in `costs` is the result of calling `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`. The specific values of `costs` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values in `rows` and `d`.
