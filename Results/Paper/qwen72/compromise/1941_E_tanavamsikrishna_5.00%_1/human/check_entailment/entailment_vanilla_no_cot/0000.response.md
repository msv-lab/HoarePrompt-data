Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of installing supports in a single row. However, the way it calculates the cost is incorrect.
   - The first loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(0, d - 1):
         row[i] = row[i] + 1
     ```
     This loop only increments the first `d-1` elements of the row, which is not correct. The cost of installing a support in any cell should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, and this should be done for all cells, not just the first `d-1` cells.
   - The second loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
         row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
     ```
     This loop is also incorrect. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, plus the minimum cost of installing a support in any of the previous cells within the distance `d`. The current implementation does not correctly handle the minimum cost calculation.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases. It should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
     - Calculate the cost of installing supports in each row.
     - Ensure that the minimum cost of installing supports in each cell is correctly computed, considering the distance `d`.
     - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List

def min_cost(row: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # Cost of installing support in the first cell
    dp[-1] = row[-1] + 1  # Cost of installing support in the last cell

    for j in range(1, n - 1):
        min_prev_cost = float('inf')
        for k in range(max(0, j - d), j):
            min_prev_cost = min(min_prev_cost, dp[k])
        dp[j] = min_prev_cost + row[j] + 1

    return dp[-1]

def solve():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [min_cost(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
    print(min(total_costs))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_cost` Function**:
  - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.
  - It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost up to each cell.
  - The cost of installing a support in the first and last cells is `a_{i,1} + 1` and `a_{i,m} + 1`, respectively.
  - For each cell `j` in the row, it finds the minimum cost of installing a support in any of the previous cells within the distance `d` and adds the cost of the current cell `a_{i,j} + 1`.

- **`solve` Function**:
  - This function handles a single test case.
  - It reads the input for the test case, calculates the cost for each row using `min_cost`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

- **Main Loop**:
  - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and calls the `solve` function for each test case.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
