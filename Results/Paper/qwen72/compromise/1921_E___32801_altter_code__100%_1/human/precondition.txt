The function `pushp_` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The integers satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
