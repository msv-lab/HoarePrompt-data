Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, and `x2` is equal to `r[4]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are such that `y1 == y2`.**
