Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is no value or variable being returned. The `return` statement is followed by nothing, which means the function will return `None` by default. However, since the task specifies to describe the information we have for any variable or value included in the return, and there is no such variable or value, the output state is that the program does not return any value.
