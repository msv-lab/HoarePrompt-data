Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It processes each test case by collecting the constraints into lists (`big`, `less`, `no`) based on their type. It then calculates the range of valid `k` values by finding the minimum value from the "less than or equal to" constraints and the maximum value from the "greater than or equal to" constraints. The program checks if this range is valid (i.e., not negative) and adjusts the count of valid `k` values by excluding any specific values that `k` cannot be (from the "not equal to" constraints). This approach ensures that the program accurately counts the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case.
