The code snippet `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `a`. This changes the values of `x` and `a` from their initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
- `loop` must be greater than 1
- `iterable` is 1
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 1
- `iterable2` is 1
- `x` is the last integer from the input
- `a` is the last integer from the input
- `num` is 0
- If `x` is 1, `big` is [1], `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list
- If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list
- Otherwise, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` contains the value of `a`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` and `a` are updated to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is [1] if `x` is 1, `less` is [a] if `x` is 2, `no` is [a] if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list.**
