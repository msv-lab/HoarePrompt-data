Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing one instance of `a`, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 2, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the second integer from the input (`a`), and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` contains the second integer from the input (`a`), and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` contains the second integer from the input (`a`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
