Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is [a, a] and `no` is [a]. If `x` is 1, `big` is [1] and `less` is [a]. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is [a, a] and `big` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big`, `less`, and `no` are all empty lists.**
