Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `less`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`) and their constraints remain unchanged.
