The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem description, it implicitly processes a series of test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. The constraints are represented by pairs (a, x), where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for ≥, 2 for ≤, 3 for ≠) and `x` is the value associated with the constraint. The function is expected to determine a value `k` that satisfies all given constraints for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result is a value `k` that meets all the constraints specified for that test case. If no such value exists, the function should return an appropriate indication (e.g., None or a specific error message).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It returns a list of values, where each value satisfies all the constraints for the corresponding test case. If no valid value exists for a test case, the function returns an appropriate indication.**
