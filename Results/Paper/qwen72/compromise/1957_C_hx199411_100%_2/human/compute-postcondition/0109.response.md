Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (This information is not directly relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is an input integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `i` is `k - 1` (This information is not directly relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is \((dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) \times dp[j - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop.
   - The current value of `m` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(1)` simply prints the integer 1.
   - The value of `1` is an explicit constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the integer 1.

Output: **1**
