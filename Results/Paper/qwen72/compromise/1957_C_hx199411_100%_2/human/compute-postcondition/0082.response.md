To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is an input integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `i` is \(m - 1\).
   - `m` is \(n - \text{num}\) and `m` must be at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except:
     - `dp[1]` which is 1.
     - `dp[2]` which is 3.
     - For each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is \((dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) \cdot dp[j - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Understanding the `dp` list:**
   - The `dp` list is initialized with length `m + 1`, and all elements are 0.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3.
   - For each `j` from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[j]` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) \cdot dp[j - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

3. **Calculating `dp[m]`:**
   - The value of `dp[m]` is determined by the formula for `j = m`:
     \[
     dp[m] = (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) \cdot dp[m - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is applied iteratively from `j = 3` to `j = m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]` as calculated by the formula above.

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, and `num` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, we can describe the value of `dp[m]` based on the given formula and the constraints.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value calculated using the formula \((dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) \cdot dp[m - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) for each j from 3 to m, with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
