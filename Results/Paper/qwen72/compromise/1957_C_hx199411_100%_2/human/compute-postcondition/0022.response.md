Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all `k` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `k - 1` because the loop index `i` starts from 0 and increments up to `k - 1`. The variable `num` will be the sum of 1 for each move where the column `c` equals the row `r`, and 2 for each move where the column `c` does not equal the row `r`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
