The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(k)` function, so it starts at 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

Given that `k` is the number of moves and it is assigned a value from the input, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0**
