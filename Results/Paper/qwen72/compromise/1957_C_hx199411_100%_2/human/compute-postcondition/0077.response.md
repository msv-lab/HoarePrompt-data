The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `k`, and `m` must still be at least 3 to ensure that `i` can be less than `m + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i - 1]` which is now `(dp[i - 2] + (i - 2) * dp[i - 3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
