Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.**
