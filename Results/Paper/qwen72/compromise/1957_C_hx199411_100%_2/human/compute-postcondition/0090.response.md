Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial state with the addition of the values of `c` and `r` being input integers.
