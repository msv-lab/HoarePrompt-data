The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 1, `m` is `n`, if `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
