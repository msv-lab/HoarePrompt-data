The code snippet `dp[1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the second element (index 1) of the list `dp`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
