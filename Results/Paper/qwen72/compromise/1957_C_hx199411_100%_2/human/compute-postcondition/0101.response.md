The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than `i`, which means `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
