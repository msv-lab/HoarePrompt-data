To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to `k - 1` before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0 and go up to `k - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
- `num` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is 0**
