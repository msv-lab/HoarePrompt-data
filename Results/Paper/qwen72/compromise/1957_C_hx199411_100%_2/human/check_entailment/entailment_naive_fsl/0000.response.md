Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the board size \( n \) is 1 and \( k \) is 0. According to the problem description, if \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 0 \), there is only one possible configuration: the board with no rooks. However, the program does not account for this specific case and would incorrectly output 1, which is not the expected output. The correct output should be 1, but the program's logic for handling \( m = 0 \) and \( m = 1 \) is not consistent with the problem's requirements. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 0
```
The program should output:
```
1
```
But the program will output:
```
1
```
This is incorrect because the program should not be entering the loop to calculate `dp` values when \( m = 0 \). The program should directly handle the case where \( m = 0 \) and output 1.
