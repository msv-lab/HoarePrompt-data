Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same input integer, `inf` remains 200001, and `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`. **
