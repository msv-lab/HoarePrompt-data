You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same input integer, `inf` remains 200001, and `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining a large constant `inf` which is set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\). This is to ensure that the array `values` can handle the maximum possible value of \(n\) as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The program then reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - An array `values` of size `inf` is initialized with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each integer from 0 to `inf-1`.

2. **Precomputation of Digit Sums:**
   - The program iterates through each integer \(i\) from 1 to `inf-1`.
   - For each integer \(i\), it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the integer to a string and then summing the integer values of each character in the string.
   - The cumulative sum of the digit sums is stored in `values[i]` by adding the current digit sum to the previous cumulative sum `values[i-1]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of \(n\) from the input.
   - It then prints the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums for the given \(n\) by accessing `values[n]`.

### Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The precomputation step runs in \(O(inf \times \log(inf))\) time, where \(\log(inf)\) is the number of digits in the largest number \(2 \times 10^5\). This is efficient given the constraints.
  - Each test case is processed in \(O(1)\) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` array.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity for \(t\) test cases is \(O(inf \times \log(inf) + t)\), which is feasible within the 0.5 seconds limit for the given constraints.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(inf)\) due to the `values` array, which is also within the limits given the problem constraints.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - For each test case, it correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed value for the given \(n\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
