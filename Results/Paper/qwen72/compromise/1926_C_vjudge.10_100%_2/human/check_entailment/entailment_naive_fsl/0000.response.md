Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in an array. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given value of \(n\). This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test, as the precomputation is done once and the retrieval for each test case is \(O(1)\). The logic for summing the digits of each number and updating the array is also correct. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
