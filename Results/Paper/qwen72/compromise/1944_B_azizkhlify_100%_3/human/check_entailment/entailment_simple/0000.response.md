### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It also reads the array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the counts of each integer in the first and second halves of the array `a`.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero. `re` is used to count the number of elements added to the result list `res`, `ul` and `ur` are used to count the number of elements added to the output arrays `l` and `r`.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each integer in the first half of the array `a` and stores these counts in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the second half of the array `a` and stores these counts in `r`.

4. **Constructing the Output Arrays:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array `l` by selecting pairs of identical elements from the first half of `a` and printing them. It updates `ul` to keep track of the number of elements added to `l`.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, it selects single elements from the first half of `a` and adds them to `res` until `ul` reaches `2k`.

5. **Constructing the Second Output Array:**
   - The program prints the elements in `res` to form the array `r`.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it attempts to balance the counts by selecting pairs of identical elements from the second half of `a` and printing them until `ul` equals `ur`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Array Lengths:**
  - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to length `n`, but they should be initialized to length `2k` since the output arrays need to have exactly `2k` elements.
- **Incorrect XOR Calculation:**
  - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of the elements in the arrays `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal. It only attempts to balance the counts, which is not sufficient to guarantee the XOR condition.
- **Logic for Balancing `ul` and `ur`:**
  - The logic for balancing `ul` and `ur` is flawed. It does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It only ensures that the counts are balanced, which is not the same as ensuring the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of the elements in the arrays `l` and `r` are equal, and it has issues with the lengths of the output arrays. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
