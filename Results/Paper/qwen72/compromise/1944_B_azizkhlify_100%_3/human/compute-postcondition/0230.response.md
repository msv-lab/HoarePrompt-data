The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, the value at index `a[n] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1.**
