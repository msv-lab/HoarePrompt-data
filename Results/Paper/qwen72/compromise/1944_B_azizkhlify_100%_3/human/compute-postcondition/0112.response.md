Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` contains all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 for each element `a[i]` that had `r[a[i] - 1]` equal to 2, otherwise `ul` equals `ur` and the loop terminates; `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0.**
