Output State: **`res` contains all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 for each element `a[i]` that had `r[a[i] - 1]` equal to 2, otherwise `ul` equals `ur` and the loop terminates; `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads input from the user and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`.
- The initial state variables `res`, `i`, `ul`, `ur`, `l`, `a`, and `r` are not affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state and adds the new values for `n` and `k` based on the user input.
