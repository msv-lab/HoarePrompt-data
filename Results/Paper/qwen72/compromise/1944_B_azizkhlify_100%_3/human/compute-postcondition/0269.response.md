Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1, `re` is increased by 1 and `res` now contains the element `a[0]`. If `re` was equal to `k` before the if statement, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `re` remains equal to `k` (or `k + 1` if the element at `a[0] - 1` in `l` is 1). Otherwise, `re` remains unchanged and `res` remains unchanged.***
