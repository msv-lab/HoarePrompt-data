Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, the value at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `n + 2`.
- The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1.
- Since `i` is `n + 2`, the index being incremented is `a[n + 2] - 1`.
- The initial state specifies that the value at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1, which remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in list `r` is also incremented by 1.
