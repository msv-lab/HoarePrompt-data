Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the elements at indices `a[i] - 1` set to 0 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was originally 2, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`, `re` is the number of elements in `a` that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `ul` is 2 times the number of elements in `a` that caused `l[a[i] - 1]` to be set to 0 (up to `k * 2`), `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the elements of `a` that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, and `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed or `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking. If `k` is true and `re` equals `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is false, the loop completes without breaking.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
