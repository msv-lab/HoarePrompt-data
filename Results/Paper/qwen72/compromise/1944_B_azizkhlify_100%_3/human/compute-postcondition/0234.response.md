Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `2 * n`, the value at index `a[j] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` does not change.
- The value of `i` is now `2 * n`.
- For each index `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, the value at the index `a[j] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by 1.
