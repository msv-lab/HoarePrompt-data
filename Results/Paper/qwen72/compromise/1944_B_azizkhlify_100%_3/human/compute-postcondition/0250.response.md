Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is 2 and `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then the element at that index is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is not 2, the element at that index remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` remains unchanged.***
