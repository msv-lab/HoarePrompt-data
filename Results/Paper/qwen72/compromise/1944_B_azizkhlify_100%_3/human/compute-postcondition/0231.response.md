The value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the index being incremented is `a[n + 1] - 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, the value at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1.**
