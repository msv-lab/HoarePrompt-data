The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `res`, followed by a space. Since the precondition states that `res` must be a non-empty list and `i` is the first element of `res`, the output will be the value of the first element of `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first element of the list `res`)**
