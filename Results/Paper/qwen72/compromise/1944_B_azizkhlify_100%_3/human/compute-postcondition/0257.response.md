Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2` and the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the element at that index is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking.***
