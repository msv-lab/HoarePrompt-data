Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list that must contain at least two elements.
- `i` is the second element in the list `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the second element in the list `res`, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Since the exact value of the second element in `res` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **[i] (where i is the second element in the list res)**
