To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, for the code to execute without an error, `a` must be a list with at least two elements (since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, implying that `a` has at least `n` elements, which is more than 1).

3. **`a[i]`**: Since `i` is 1, the code will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

4. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the second element of the list `a` (since `a[1]` is the element at index 1) followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
