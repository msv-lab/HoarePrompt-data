To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The variable `i` is set to 2.
2. The `print` statement is trying to print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
3. Since `i` is 2, the code will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `a` or its contents. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[2]` without additional information.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
