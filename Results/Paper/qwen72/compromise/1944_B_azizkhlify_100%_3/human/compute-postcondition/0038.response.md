Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
2. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
3. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2.
4. `l` is a list of `n` zeros. The element at index `a[0] - 1` is set to 0 if it was originally 2, and the element at index `a[1] - 1` is set to 0 if it was originally 2. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.
5. `r` is a list of `n` zeros. The element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`.
6. `re` is 0.
7. `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2 or if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains 0.
8. `ur` is 0.
9. `res` is an empty list.
10. `i` is 2.
11. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 2.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the third element of the list `a` (indexing starts at 0).

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the third element of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the specific `print` statement provided.
