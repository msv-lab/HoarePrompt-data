Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ul` is equal to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ul` retains its original value and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ul` and `r[a[i] - 1]` retain their original values.***
