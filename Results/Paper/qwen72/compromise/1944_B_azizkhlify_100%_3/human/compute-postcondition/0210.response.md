Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `r[a[i] - 1]`, `ul`, and `ur` retain their original values. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ur` is increased by 2, while `ul` retains its original value. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` retains its original value, and both `ul` and `ur` retain their original values.***
