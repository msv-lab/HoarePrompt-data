To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
2. `res` is an empty list.
3. `i` is 0.
4. `n` must be greater than 0.
5. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is decremented by 2 for every `a[j]` that appeared twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
6. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
7. `re` is 0.
8. `ul` is the number of pairs of elements in `a` that appeared twice in the first `n` elements of `a` (up to a maximum of `k * 2`).
9. `ur` is 0.
10. `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is not zero.
11. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` and using `end=' '` to ensure that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.
- Given that `i` is 0, the statement will print the first element of the list `a`.

### Determining the Value of `a[i]`:
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is 0.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`.

### Additional Information:
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. This means that the element `a[0]` (i.e., `a[i]` when `i` is 0) corresponds to an index in the list `l` where the value is 1.
- This implies that `a[0]` is a valid index in `l` and `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
