To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- The element `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values of the elements in `a` are not specified, but we know that `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a` because `i` is 0.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is 0, so `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
3. **Condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`**: This condition tells us that the element in the list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 2. This implies that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

### What is Printed:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a` and it appears exactly twice in the list `a`, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where a[i] is the first element of the list a, and it appears exactly twice in the list a)**
