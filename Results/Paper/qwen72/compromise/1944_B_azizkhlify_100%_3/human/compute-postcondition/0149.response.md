Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `ul` is 0 or 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `l[a[1] - 1]` and `l[a[2] - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
