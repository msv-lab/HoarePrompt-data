The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n` to `2 * n` (exclusive). This means that `i` starts at `n` and increases by 1 at each iteration until it reaches `2 * n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ul` is equal to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ul` retains its original value and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ul` and `r[a[i] - 1]` retain their original values.**
