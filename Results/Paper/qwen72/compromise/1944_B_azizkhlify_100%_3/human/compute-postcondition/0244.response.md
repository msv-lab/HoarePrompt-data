The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we do not know if `i` or `n` were modified within the loop body, but based on the information provided, the only change that can be made at the start of the next iteration is to increment `i` by 1. The condition for `ul` and the list `l` does not affect the loop head variables, so it does not need to be included in the state adjustment.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
