The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
