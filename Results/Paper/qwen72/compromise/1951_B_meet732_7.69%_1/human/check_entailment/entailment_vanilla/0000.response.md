### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings `a_i`.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination bracket where each match is between the current cow and the winner of the previous match.
   - We need to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by potentially swapping its position with another cow once.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of ratings `l`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It extracts the rating of cow `k` and initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than cow `k`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of cows with higher ratings.
   - The loop iterates through the list of ratings to find the first two cows with ratings higher than cow `k` and stores their indices in `ind`.
   - If `ind` is empty, it means cow `k` has the highest rating and can win all matches except the last one, so it returns `n - 1`.
   - If `ind` has only one element:
     - If the element is at index 0, it means the cow with the highest rating is in the first position, and cow `k` can win `k - 1` matches.
     - If the element is greater than `k`, it means cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - If `ind` has two elements:
     - If the first element is at index 0, it means the cow with the highest rating is in the first position, and cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If `k` is greater than the second element, it means cow `k` can win up to `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` matches.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where cow `k` has the highest rating.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there is only one cow with a higher rating.
   - The logic for handling two cows with higher ratings is also correct, ensuring the maximum number of wins is calculated based on the positions of these cows.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The program ensures that the maximum number of wins is achieved by considering the positions of the cows with higher ratings and the position of cow `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k` based on the problem description. The edge cases and main logic are handled appropriately.
